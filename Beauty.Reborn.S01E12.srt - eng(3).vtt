00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.400
The next CEO of PD will be…

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.880
Mr. Apo.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.840
My mother's already dead.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.040
Your mother? Dead?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.160
She actually left you!

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.240
I've found Ms. Krongthong's address. But…

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
You should prepare yourself a little.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.440
Your mother didn't want you to be born.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280
She intended to have an abortion.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.200
Your father begged her to keep you.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.479
On top of that,
he legally married Krongthong.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.080
Eventually,
they just couldn't make it work.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
So they divorced.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.160
Dad…

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.560
You said your father lied

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.760
so you'd end up serving
Ms. Namnuan and the boys.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360
That's not true at all.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080
Tesho knew exactly
what kind of person your mother was.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.120
He didn't want you to get hurt.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.640
And he didn't want you
tied to her anymore.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.160
At the time, he thought
it was what was best for you.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.880
Thanks, Dad, for telling me the truth.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.960
No problem.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160
Getting it off my chest
made me feel a little better.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.320
That's all for now, Din.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080
Yes.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.160
I'm sorry.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.240
About earlier, when I asked to go out…

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.600
Can we postpone it?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.560
That's fine.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.000
We can go whenever.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.840
I'm not going anywhere anyway.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.120
Thanks.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.240
Mr. Nam moved out of the room?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.800
Yes. He said he was moving to a hotel.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.400
Oh, Ms. Baicha.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.600
Could I take tomorrow off?

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.120
Sure. But what
are you taking time off for?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.120
For prenatal care.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.280
I didn't think
I'd get pregnant this easily.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.440
So, what new products
are we launching next,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.440
Mr. Apo?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.120
Our new line

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.480
is men's products.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.120
Men? That's our new market?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.160
PD has never made products
in that category before.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.040
But the market value

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.080
for men's cosmetics

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.440
is 15 billion baht.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.040
Wait. Hold on.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.040
I'd like to hear

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.920
the vision from a CEO, like Mr. Apo.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.040
Uh…

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.880
On average, the Thai cosmetics market
grows around 14 to 15% a year.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.840
Even though we don't have exact figures
on how much men's cosmetics grow yearly,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.160
it's clearly going up every year.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.720
And there are still
only a few players in the market.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.200
So what reason is there
not to jump in, Mr. Chakrit?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.800
Because we're not experts.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.000
Ms. Sara just said
we've never marketed this before.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.520
Being inexperienced and not doing it
are two different things.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.520
We'd never done low-cost gift sets either,
yet they're the ones thriving right now.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240
And everyone disagreed with that idea.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.120
And tell me.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.120
Which product is making
so much profit right now?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.160
Why did you hang me out to dry like that?
I only agreed to be CEO

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.040
because I thought you'd back me up.
Did you see?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.000
That Krit guy nearly carved me up
in the middle of the meeting.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.160
I'm sorry.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.280
I just have a lot on my mind right now.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.680
Yo told me what happened.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.840
I get it.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.320
But if you can't keep work
separate from your personal life,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.560
Krit will manage
to undermine me sooner or later.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.320
I'll be careful
not to let this happen again.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.600
Luckily, I've been doing
some extra research lately.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.640
But I probably won't be
this lucky every time.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.720
Since Mr. Nam is so dedicated,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.440
can we continue the discussion now?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.960
I'm serious about men's products.
I'm not just trying to save face.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.600
I know.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.480
Please send the details directly to me.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.680
If Din's still losing it,
contact me directly.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.720
Thank you.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.880
Well…

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.920
Ms. Sarah.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.520
Actually,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.480
there's one more thing

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.560
I need to talk to you about.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.040
So…

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.040
Excuse me.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.160
Okay.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.520
‎18 EARLY SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY:
‎HOW TO NOTICE AND CONFIRM

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.120
"It takes at least two weeks

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.680
before you can test
if you're pregnant or not."

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.920
And if a period is late,
are there any reasons besides pregnancy?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.360
"There are many reasons for a late period.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.680
It doesn't always mean pregnancy.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.760
Another major reason is stress."

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.640
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely stress.
There's no other reason.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.280
Hey, it's already noon.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.160
Are you so down, you won't even eat?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.040
Are you worried?

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.360
Is now really the time?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.440
Is there anything you want to talk about?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.080
About what?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.600
About you standing me up yesterday.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.320
You weren't home.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.760
Where were you?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.520
We're open half-day today.
Come back tomorrow.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.320
I'm not here to eat.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.960
Your name is Krongthong, right?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.720
I knew you'd come looking for me one day.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.880
Don't think I'm going
to appreciate being a mother.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.840
Because I never intended to have you.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400
I know.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.040
Good, then.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.920
And don't come here
thinking you owe me anything.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.640
It's enough that you're well and happy.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.120
Because I could never have given you
any of this anyway.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.520
Hey!

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.600
You told me you'd pay today.
If I don't get the money by 2 p.m.,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.120
you're not selling here!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.560
Didn't I tell you
I'll close the shop early

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.480
to get you guys the money?!

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.400
What's this? If you're going to talk
like that, I'm not paying anything!

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.760
Don't make excuses!
If you're going to pay, pay now! Now!

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.880
-Pay up! Stay out of this!
-Bring it on! Come on!

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.800
Come on! I've got nothing to lose!

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.000
-Come on. Come at me!
-Hey!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.320
Yeah, I'll be back for it.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.760
-You wait right here!
-Fine!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.440
-You'll see!
-You bitch!

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.040
You better hurry back!

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.880
Don't you dare think
I'm gonna give you any money!

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.080
Damn those guys.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.680
In the end, I paid off her debt.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.360
It was my first and last act as her son.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.000
Are you at peace with it?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.960
You don't think
I was being stupid, do you?

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.720
Nobody's smart all the time.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.920
The only important thing

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.680
is whether you feel at peace with it.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800
But I think your dad
was right about everything.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.720
If I were a dad,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.040
I'd probably tell my kid
their mother had died

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.720
rather than let them grow up
and have to deal with this.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.040
We can't choose
the family we're born into.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.640
But we can choose

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.480
what kind of person to be.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.360
And the person you've chosen to be

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.760
is not bad at all.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.360
Just "not bad"?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.520
You want me to shower you with praise?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280
Why don't you try then?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.480
You're strong,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.920
smart,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.400
and a good person.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.040
I think

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.280
that's more than enough.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.440
Please.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.600
Please.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.720
I am going to take such good care of you.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.480
And you have to take good care of me too.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.200
Got it?

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.000
How?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.960
Ah. Well…

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.760
Look.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.600
Here.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.040
See this?

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.240
If we're in love

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.720
and my hair falls like this…

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.160
…you need to tuck it

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.800
behind my ear for me.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.840
Yeah.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.720
And then… kiss my forehead,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.280
be sweet,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.800
make me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.960
You got that?

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.960
That's all? Super easy.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.120
Yeah.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.160
What's wrong?
Why are you acting so shifty?

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.280
Well, it's about the thing
I needed advice on.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.040
But I don't want anyone else to hear.
I'm afraid they'll start gossiping again.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.760
Is it a scandal?

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.080
Don't tease me. I'm actually
really stressed about this.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.840
-Hello, Ms. Chakriya.
-Hello.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.720
Since you're a woman, Ms. Sarah,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.680
could you tell me something?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.280
If a woman suddenly goes
completely silent for a long time,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.320
what should I do?

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.320
The person who disappeared,
what's her relationship with you?

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360
She's a friend.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.880
We just had a fight,
and I don't know how to apologize.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.400
She won't answer my calls,
and she reads my texts but doesn't reply.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.160
In that case…

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.280
just apologize directly.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.360
Especially if you're the one in the wrong,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.640
there's nothing better than going
to see her and talking it out.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.800
What are you hesitating about?

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.800
Nothing. I just…

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.240
I don't know where to start.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.480
How about some
Western-style flower diplomacy?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.000
Give her flowers as an apology.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.080
And follow that up
with our company's new product.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.680
It'll be a promotion at the same time.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.640
Ms. Sarah!

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.160
You're sneaking in a product placement
like it's a TV drama.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.840
My deepest apologies, sir.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.080
I didn't think Nam
would be this well-prepared.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400
Yes.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.160
Next time,

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.480
I definitely won't mess up, sir.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.600
That verbose old man!
He talks way too much!

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.000
MEDICAL CLINIC

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.880
So, are you buying or not?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.280
Are you sure this will work?

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.200
If you're not sure, don't buy it.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.320
I have things to do. You go home first.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.480
Okay.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.840
Hey!

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.640
Hey, miss.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.960
Miss.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.400
Are you alright?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.080
Baicha?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.280
Din!

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760
Baicha.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.520
Baicha, are you hurt?

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.480
Should I take you to the hospital?

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.400
No, I'm fine.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.720
I was just startled.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.040
Okay, well then…

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.720
I'll take you home.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.000
What's this med, Baicha?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.160
What's going on?

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880
What is this medicine?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.320
I asked you what this medicine is.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.480
I…

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.240
I'm pregnant, Din.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.080
Why are you just getting back now?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.680
You didn't answer your phone.
I waited up all night.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.240
I'm sorry. There was
another issue at the factory.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.080
So I went back to sort it out,
and my phone battery died too.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.960
I thought…

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.280
you had been in an accident.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.680
Were you worried about me?

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.800
I'm not talking anymore.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.040
It's good that you're back.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.400
I'm going to get an hour of sleep
and then head to work.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.960
I can give you the day off.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.400
I'm just as much
of a workaholic as you are.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.000
Currently, the market value
for men's products in Thailand

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.480
is 35 billion baht.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.080
Wait, wait, wait.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.360
Didn't you say yesterday

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.320
it was only 15 billion? Where did
the other 20 billion come from?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.720
Didn't you read the report I gave you?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.600
Men's cosmetics,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.800
like deodorants, perfumes, and roll-ons,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.800
are indeed valued at 15 billion baht.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.880
But the interesting ones
are products related to skin, hair,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.040
and beard care. That's where it is.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.640
The 20 billion baht I wrote in the report.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.680
So, what will the products
look like, Ms. Sarah?

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.960
We'll launch three items first.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.000
Number one, an anti-wrinkle serum.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.120
Number two, shaving cream.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.920
And number three, aftershave.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.960
The market leaders
already own these categories.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.360
If we clash with them,
we'll lose everything.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.000
This group of people
isn't attached to brands.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.880
They like to try new things.
They watch reviews on social media.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.160
They compare quality and price.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.440
And our product will enter as a new option

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.000
that is smart and offers great value

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.480
for people who are looking
to choose the best for themselves.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.640
Right, Mr. Pathawee?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.640
Mr. Pathawee?

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.560
Yes, right.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.760
That's right. Does anyone disagree?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.960
Only two people disagree.
I'll consider this project approved then.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.200
In that case,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.360
does anyone have any questions?

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.360
Not about the new product…

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.120
but about

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.480
Ms. Namnuan's position
as an executive director.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.800
What? Why are you

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.200
suddenly bringing this up, Ms. Rosarin?

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.960
Ms. Namnuan's performance
has not been clearly defined lately.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.720
And I believe that many
of the shareholders present here

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.520
share the same opinion.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.080
I'd like to exercise my right
as a 20% shareholder

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.400
to nominate Nina

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.680
to take the position
of executive director instead.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.720
Does anyone here object?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.400
Ms. Rosarin, wait a minute. Ms. Rosarin.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.280
Ms. Rosarin, hold on! Ms. Rosarin, wait!

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.000
Ms. Rosarin.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.880
I'm sorry.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800
You broke your promise to me.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.120
You said my salary and benefits would
stay the same if I sold you my shares.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.600
But now you're forcing me
out of my position like this,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.040
and that's going to affect
my pay and privileges too.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.360
Do you have a contract or any witnesses?

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.480
You can't stab me in the back like this.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.840
Who's the one doing the backstabbing?

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.560
Isn't it you, Ms. Namnuan?

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.080
Your own family.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.800
The child you raised.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.200
You chose to betray him

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.880
for your own benefit.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.640
How could I possibly trust you
with an executive director position?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.920
Are we clear?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.080
If you'll excuse me.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.000
We

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.240
have a lot of things to do.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.480
Watch out for the picture frame.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200
Alright, once you're done,
you can go downstairs.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.120
What?

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.960
You walked all the way here
just to gloat, right?

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.640
You must be really satisfied
seeing this happen to me.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.320
If I said I wasn't satisfied,
I'd be lying.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.680
But I'm only slightly satisfied.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.520
Because I already knew
what was going to happen.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.560
At least I got a good price for my shares.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.360
I don't have to stress anymore,
unlike you guys,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.120
who are still foolishly fighting,
even though you know you can't win.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.240
That might be true.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.880
But even if we lose,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.720
at least we are fighting together.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.840
Unlike you right now, Auntie.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.880
You have no one left.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.920
The reason I came to help

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.400
is because you haven't
succeeded at anything.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.320
Even the recent machinery deal,
you messed that up too.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.960
But Nam won't agree.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.000
What am I supposed to do? If I get
too harsh, will you turn on me too?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.760
Your job is to get PD for us

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.640
in exchange for your revenge

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.400
without causing us to lose our interest.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.400
So, just focus on how

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.600
to get Din out of the way.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.880
But if you can't do that,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.720
we won't need you anymore.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.920
This coffee

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.640
is terrible.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.800
When will the people here
finally remember how I like my coffee?

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.240
It's your job to remind the housekeeper.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.920
If you can't even get this right,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.120
you should just leave.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.640
You understand, Chakrit?

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.280
Yes.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.800
-Table eight.
-Copy that.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.400
Aren't you having coffee?

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.000
I shouldn't drink
too much coffee right now.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.080
Baicha.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.360
I'm so sorry.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240
For everything.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.120
I really didn't mean it.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.520
It wasn't all your fault.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.800
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.760
I'm truly sorry.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.320
I love you so much.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.560
You are the friend

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.640
I love the most.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.480
I really can't lose you.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.280
Let's go back to how we were.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.280
But we never changed.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.720
And more importantly,
so what if you don't have me?

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.480
You still have Ms. Sarah.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.840
What does that have to do with Ms. Sarah?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.760
She just suggested
I apologize to you directly.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.320
Really? Or did you just use me
as an excuse to talk to her?

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.239
Why are you snapping at me?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.520
I'm not. Don't pick a fight with me.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.440
I don't know why you're mad
that I talked to Ms. Sarah about this.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.440
Maybe it's about what happened that night.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.760
I'm sorry. I was drunk.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.840
You said sorry. Now go back.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.760
No way. I really need to be sure
that you're not angry at me anymore.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.560
Please forgive me.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.639
Forget it. You can go now.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.800
Are you just going to hang out here
instead of working, Mr. CEO?

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040
I'm leaving now.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.840
Don't you dare get involved
with those Phimarndech people, even him.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.280
You know how much Mr. Praphop
is pressuring me right now.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.560
I might have to go after him.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.520
What are you going to do?

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.280
Now that it's come to this,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.240
if I can't beat the Phimarndech family,
I'd rather die.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.400
But before I die,

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.640
I'm taking them all down to hell with me.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.800
Whether it's Nam, Din,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480
or anyone else.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.760
TO BAICHA:

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.320
TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE HOME
DON'T OVERTHINK IT

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.520
I'LL HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.920
Baicha.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.200
Who's the father?

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.720
I really don't know

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.560
if he even wants the baby.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.280
That's why I was thinking
about getting an abortion.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.440
I don't know what to do, Din.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.560
Please don't do that.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.440
I'm begging you.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.040
Why are you begging me?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.400
Because I'm thinking about myself.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.080
I was so hurt

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.560
when I found out
my own mother tried to do that.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.560
I don't want your child
to feel the way I did.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.440
So, what should I do, Din?

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.560
What am I supposed to do?

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.560
Hey.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.520
Mr. Din?

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.280
Yes, what is it?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.240
What about you?

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.160
I've called you many times.
It's like you didn't even see me.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.520
I had to knock to get your attention.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.200
Sorry. I'm just stressed about work.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.400
I think we should go to bed.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.240
Let's go.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.680
Can you come out and meet me?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.880
This way, no one loses anything.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.720
You can't really blame me.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.120
-What are you doing?
-I'm just…

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.600
finding a way to make you

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.600
give me your shares,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.920
handsome.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.320
We're only pretending to be married.
If you want to see other people,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.240
I won't hold it against you.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.720
Just do it properly, and don't
stab me in the back, that's all.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.960
Baicha is pregnant.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.680
Who's the father?

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.040
-Don't tell me…
-Yes.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.800
Baicha is pregnant with my baby.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.160
