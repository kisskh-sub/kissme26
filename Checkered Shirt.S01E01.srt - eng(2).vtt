00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.757
Minji, why aren't you responding...

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.093
Didn't you say you'd call when you got home?

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.179
Guess she hasn't arrived yet

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.181
Hey, is Minji living in Jeju or something?

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.557
It's been four hours

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.185
You were the one who wanted to break up before

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.647
Yeah, back then

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.523
But now that we've actually broken up

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.025
I feel like I can't live without her

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:27.778
Hey

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.447
Didn't you guys only date for two months?

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.491
The time spent together

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.284
Doesn't measure the depth of love

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.203
*sigh*

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:43.961
Hey

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:45.712
Look behind you

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.547
Those girls are getting his number

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.307
That server must be in the Theater Department at our school

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.688
Wow... look at those girls' confidence

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.023
Must be popular?

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.402
Not sure?

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.529
*sigh*

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.073
What would a forever-single like you know?

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.376
Well...

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.086
They look nice

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.797
Hey, should we ask them if they wanna hang out?

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.757
The server?

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.009
Are you crazy?

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.677
No, those girls...

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:34.803
Ah...

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.264
Why would the server want to hang out with us?

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.183
No, I meant... nevermind, my mistake

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.019
What do you think?

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.103
Want me to go talk to them?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:44.771
Forget it

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:47.858
You were just going on about Minji, what's this about?

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:48.692
Hey

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.486
They say the best way to get over someone is to meet someone new

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.696
Before you go to the military

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.239
You gonna leave without even having kissed anyone?

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.407
Come on!

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.035
Let's hit the singles bar tomorrow?

00:01:58.035 --> 00:01:59.369
No, that's different

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.830
You're wasting precious time right now

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.207
Hey, I'll be right back

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.417
OfferUp?

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.294
Oh yeah, go ahead and eat

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.013
Is it from OfferUp?

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:18.930
Ah, yes

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.141
Oh, sorry I'm late

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.476
That's 45,000 won

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.728
I only have a 50,000 won bill

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.731
Then wait a moment

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.692
It's okay, just keep it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.155
Thanks

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.867
Aren't you going to check it?

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.077
Ah...

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.122
Well, whatever

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.626
Hope you enjoy it

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.346
Nice to meet you

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.065
Oh, you're here?

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.526
This is my friend

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.361
The most handsome one, Jung-woo

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.446
Hi

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.572
Hi

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.908
Turns out they're from our school, Korean Literature

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.494
Hey, show me what you got from OfferUp

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.918
Ah...

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.462
This guy's such an engineering student!

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.632
How many times did I tell you not to buy plaid shirts?

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.802
You really love plaid that much?

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.139
Don't tell me you only have plaid shirts at home?

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.516
That's right, I only have plaid shirts

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.102
Didn't you say you were buying clothes for tomorrow?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.562
Where are you going?

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.021
Ah... amusement park

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.481
Amusement park

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.983
Wow, that'll be fun

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.328
Not bad, right?

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.066
I'm the one who bought

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.860
The plaid shirt on OfferUp earlier

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.032
I found this in the pocket

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.416
Just throw it away

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.846
You up for it?

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.307
Should be!

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.734
Isn't it better than you thought?

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.612
I swear, if you show up wearing that tomorrow...

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.239
Is it that bad?

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.032
It's awful

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.742
No, it's nice!

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:27.911
It's really nice

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.412
Hey, it's perfect for me!

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.123
It just looks good

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.103
If you haven't deleted the photo yet

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.813
Could I get it again?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.404
Oh my god!

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.198
Hey, don't you have afternoon classes?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.222
Um... OfferUp?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.183
Ah... yes

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.435
Here you go

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.437
Thank you

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.572
But...

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.118
Didn't you say it was new?

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.245
What?
