WEBVTT

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.008
Um... Marketplace?

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.260
Ah... yes

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:11.637
Here you go

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.348
Thank you

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:24.775
But...

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.238
Didn't you say it was new?

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:31.823
What?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.916
Ah... I only tried it on once

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.001
Since it didn't fit me

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.131
I'm sorry

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:51.677
It's fine

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.595
Um...

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.973
Don't you come to our bar often?

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.143
Next time you come

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.728
I'll give you a cocktail on the house

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.733
Yeah, sure

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.403
Make sure to come next time

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.487
Okay

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.793
Wow... you actually wore it

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.380
Hey, if I bought it, I should wear it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.049
Yeah, wear it all you want

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.387
What are you talking about...

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.932
Hey, Minji blocked me

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:39.850
For real?

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.143
Yeah...

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.270
I checked everything today

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.272
Don't even think about going home

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:46.732
Hey

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.775
We can't party till morning anymore

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:50.652
We're not 20 anymore

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.447
No, I can't today

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.992
This is hilarious

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:59.911
Hey, isn't this unlike Minji?

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.121
Shut up

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.040
All this is so that when you go to the military

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.166
The younger guys won't disrespect you

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.667
Aren't I helping you?

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.128
Yeah~ Nice excuse

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.550
Hey, I'm going to class

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.301
See you later

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.469
Yeah, go

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.018
Mon, Tue, Wed 5PM to 11PM

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:24.853
Those are my work hours

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.064
In case you come when I'm not here

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.116
Okay

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.326
I'm on my way

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.535
Where to?

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:41.953
Almost there

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.997
Ah...

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.040
What?

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.501
Minji wants to drink today?

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.752
Suddenly?

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.504
Yeah, what should I do?

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.923
If I say tomorrow, she might think I changed my mind

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.174
This is such a good opportunity

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.842
Just go drink with Minji...

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.010
Really?

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.221
But we need to do Project: Get Jeongwoo a Girlfriend

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.973
Stop talking nonsense and just meet Minji

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.183
Or how about tomorrow?

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:03.892
I'll treat

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.852
Okay, uh...

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.691
Ah... I knew this would happen

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.742
What are you doing today?

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.494
I changed my shift

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.038
I'll message you that you can come today

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.462
Welcome

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.717
You really came

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:40.929
Didn't you tell me to come?

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.265
That's right

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.183
Did you come alone?

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.060
Yes

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.231
Then look at the menu

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.483
And tell me what you'd like

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:00.198
Since I don't know much about cocktails

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.825
Just give me anything

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.454
The clothes suit you well

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.291
Ah...

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.502
You must like plaid shirts?

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:13.837
Yes

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.339
Engineering major?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:18.216
Yes

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.679
I thought so

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:24.764
What?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.519
You go to Seohan University, right?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.856
Yes, you too?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.649
No

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.818
I don't go to college

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.571
Ah...

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.782
Wait here for a moment

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.494
Yes, I'll be right back

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.963
Here you go

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.218
What's this?

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:03.720
A Blow Job

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:06.806
Blow Job?

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.893
What does that mean?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.105
Look it up

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.701
Yeah, oral?

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.130
Where?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.090
Outside

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.132
PC bang?

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.384
Yeah

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.677
What time you coming?

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.970
Why?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.555
I'm going home with Minji now

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:52.227
Damn... don't keep her too long

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.980
Sorry, I don't have my phone

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.954
How's the taste?

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.623
Yeah, it's okay

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.421
Do you have a photo of your girlfriend?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:22.507
I don't have one

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.304
You must have high standards?

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.933
She was pretty

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.856
Really?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.151
Am I not prettier?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.450
Do you like being called pretty?

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.163
Well, it's not bad

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.296
Where are you going?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.049
Ah, I'm covering someone's shift today so I get off early

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.467
That drink's on me

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:07.844
Let's go together

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.146
You idiot, send her home quick

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:22.192
Ah... please, just one day

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.152
Where am I supposed to go?

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.820
You said PC bang

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.822
Says she's out now

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.324
Or sauna?

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.492
F...

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.159
30,000 won

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.453
50,000 won

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:36.873
Hey

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.547
Do you play games?

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.050
What games?

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.929
Anything really

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.223
Do you have a favorite game?

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.475
Halli Galli?

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.144
Ah...

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.687
No, not that kind

00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.523
Games you play at PC bang

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.485
I don't really play games

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.365
Want to have a beer then?

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.408
My treat

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.618
Ah...

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.328
I live far away

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.162
I need to go now to catch the last train

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:18.872
Oh really?

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.126
Do you live alone?

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.377
Yes

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.712
Where do you live?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.006
In Kkachisan

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.760
Why do you come from so far?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.389
Just...

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.057
That's how it turned out

00:08:36.765 --> 00:08:37.975
Ah...

00:08:38.475 --> 00:08:39.853
That's really far

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.982
Yeah, well...

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.234
I'll get going then

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.361
Um...

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.282
Want to have a drink in Kkachisan?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.870
Can't go home?

00:08:58.537 --> 00:08:59.997
Ah...

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.207
No...

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:05.627
My roommate is with his girlfriend

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:07.839
Ah...

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.718
But I don't think anything's open near my place

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:13.845
Or let me stay over

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.095
What?

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.764
I can go, but

00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:18.390
Since there's no way back

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.810
We can order something to eat at home
