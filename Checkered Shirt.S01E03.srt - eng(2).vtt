00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:07.925
Wow...

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.968
Your place is really nice.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.138
You live here alone?

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.640
Yes.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.434
You can speak casually.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.019
You're older than me.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.854
Ah...

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:22.981
Right.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.287
Are you preparing for a transfer?

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.247
Ah, yes...

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.501
I heard you weren't attending school...

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:45.253
Did you drop out?

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:48.882
I'm on leave.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.968
Which school do you go to?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.803
Donghan University.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.138
Donghan?

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:57.432
Huh?

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.101
That's nearby, isn't it?

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.519
Yes.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.492
Can you see our school?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:17.452
Yes.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.705
Oh...

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.875
When was this photo taken?

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:25.919
In high school.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.131
Cute.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.176
I'm cute?

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.764
Seohan University, I like our school.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.268
Do you think I could get in?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.061
What's your major?

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:47.357
I'm in art, but I'm transferring to sciences.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.860
Is that even possible?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.405
I'm also considering retaking the entrance exam.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.240
Which department?

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.200
Computer Engineering.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:58.076
Huh?

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.164
Hey, are you trying to impress me?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.124
I'm in Computer Engineering.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.001
I know.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.754
What? How do you know?

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.839
I heard you talking with your friends.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.299
At the bar.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.052
Ah...

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:17.637
Seokgu Beer is our hangout spot.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.974
You must be busy...

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.977
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.025
And you...

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.860
Why aren't you dating?

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.112
It's not that I don't want to...

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.448
I just can't.

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:39.534
Never dated?

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:40.410
No!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.496
Look,

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.748
I've had some connections.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.459
But since we're in engineering...

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.669
Natural meetings are difficult.

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:51.838
It's mostly through introductions.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.634
So first you meet for dinner and talk,

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:57.094
Then go to a café and talk more,

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.638
Spend time getting to know each other, right?

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.140
But after that...

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.851
How should I put it?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.813
I'm not curious anymore.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.359
How can you figure everything out from the start?

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.902
You just didn't like them.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.739
You think so?

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.744
Must have high standards?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.998
I'm telling you that's not it.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.503
Can you drink well?

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:33.922
I don't drink much.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.799
Just...

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.218
The type to eat quickly and go home?

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.021
Are you okay?

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:53.859
Let me see.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:03.410
I'll do it.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.037
Where's the bathroom?

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.247
Ah...

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.249
Hey.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:10.709
Yeah?

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.491
What's that?

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.369
Sleeping pills.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.914
Why are you taking those?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.000
Because I have trouble sleeping.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.170
You're going to sleep already?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.423
I'm not sleepy yet.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.593
If you're not sleepy, don't sleep.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.720
Want to watch a movie with me?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.397
They're kissing without even dating.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.900
That can happen.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.029
I don't get it.

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:28.036
Of course you don't, you've never done it.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:30.997
Are you making fun of me?

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.255
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.966
How would I know without trying?

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:47.472
Are you curious?

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.767
About what?

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.478
Kissing?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.985
I am curious.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:07.742
Do you know what this is?

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:08.952
It's a jelly.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.871
It's called a kiss jelly.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.416
They say when you eat it,

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.667
It feels like a kiss.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.718
Try licking it.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.177
What?

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.431
Try it.

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.657
What's with that expression?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.410
You touched me.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.912
I didn't touch you.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.124
You're so innocent.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.385
What kind of drama is this?

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.262
Why are there so many kissing scenes?

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.477
You're like...

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.604
You're such a dork.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:20.982
What?

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.903
Is that a compliment?

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.994
Can I really do it?

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.373
Do what?

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.542
Kiss you.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.046
Are you drunk?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.217
I think you're more drunk than I am.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.555
Is my face very red?

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.726
I think the alcohol is kicking in.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.736
If you don't want to, say so.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.548
You...

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.718
What?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.180
You said you were curious.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.850
I was just showing you.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.354
But...

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.064
This isn't a kiss.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.653
I know that much.
