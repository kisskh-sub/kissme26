WEBVTT

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:05.881
But...

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.842
Am I doing well?

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:11.929
What?

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:17.309
Will I not be looked down upon elsewhere?

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:21.939
Where else are you going to do this?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.026
Right.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.366
Is that important?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.869
Hey

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.498
What was your name again?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.628
I never told you

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:53.679
I know

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.931
What?

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.684
Do you know everything?

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.185
Are you a stalker?

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:02.270
At our place

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.231
You should have only hit on girls once or twice

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:06.733
How many times a day did you introduce yourself?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.820
Ah...

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.613
This is embarrassing

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.949
But that wasn't me

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.493
My friend is the one who likes that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.703
Not me

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:27.671
Is it a single character?

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.219
I see

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:44.688
This is really good

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.316
Ah...

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.235
Are you crazy, seriously?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.079
Did you wake up?

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:43.872
Yeah

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:46.124
Hey, did I drink a lot yesterday?

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.211
I can't remember anything

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.671
We had a lot of fun yesterday

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.590
I...

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050
Since class ran late...

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.218
I'll go first

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.594
It was fun

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:11.608
Hey

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.276
Are you going today?

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:14.528
Where?

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:16.863
To the hunting pocha

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.491
Why so suddenly?

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.993
Are you finally realizing you're going to the military?

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.955
Yeah, so are we going?

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:26.998
No

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.208
Why not?

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.837
Ah, why... really... ah...

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.673
What's wrong with you today? Did you eat something bad?

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.758
When I say let's go

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.717
Even if you go

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:38.885
You'll just sit there like a coward

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.303
Why are you acting so weird today?

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.680
Why so strange?

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:43.765
Ah...

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.685
Hey

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.395
Then that time

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.729
You said you'd introduce me

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:54.776
Yeah

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.736
Does she have a boyfriend?

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.446
I don't think so yet

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.158
Then introduce her to me

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:02.951
Are you crazy?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.327
A guy who's enlisting in a month

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.620
Why not?

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.038
Even if it's not romance, we can just...

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.041
Be friends, right?

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.459
Hey, and besides

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.087
Didn't you say she wanted to meet me?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.883
Ah... this is really suspicious

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.677
Come on, just ask her once

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.512
Quickly

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.474
Then let's drink too

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.309
Alcohol

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.395
Then buy me a tart

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:31.980
Okay

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.149
Wait a moment...

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:37.861
Hey...

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.155
I don't have my wallet?

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.489
What? You didn't bring it?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.659
Seems like I left it

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.828
Must be at home

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.210
Isn't it at the PC bang?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.962
Yeah, might be at the PC bang

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:57.380
Hey, let's go check

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.048
Huh?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.341
Should we call and ask?

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.383
Yeah! No, no

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.468
Why not? Let's call and ask

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.469
No, no

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.096
Thinking about it again

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:05.764
Uh...

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.307
It's at home

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.059
Hey, it's definitely at home

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:18.235
So you buy the tart

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.738
Ah, buy it

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.394
Hey, they say everyone's almost here?

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.144
Really?

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.145
They say to come to Seokgu Beer?

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.604
Huh?

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.313
Hey, no

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:56.231
Why?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.399
Let's go somewhere else

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.317
Honestly, aren't you tired of that place?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.987
She wanted to drink cocktails there, let's just go

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.154
Please...

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:03.905
Huh?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.618
Hey, no?

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.995
What day is it today?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.664
Today's Friday, why?

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:15.875
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 5 PM to 11 PM

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.754
Cool! Let's go to Seokgu Beer

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.634
Ah, this guy is acting really weird

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.719
Why is he like this?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.929
Hey, come with us

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.740
It's not because he's handsome?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.826
What are you talking about? It's not that

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.042
Really?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:58.960
Ah... yeah

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:01.504
Since he's going to the military

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.423
But these days

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.508
They say you can use phones in the military too

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:06.468
Yeah!

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.181
Well, that's true

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.309
What?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.977
Why are you so enthusiastic today?

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:16.978
Oh!

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:20.565
Oppa, you don't have my number, right?

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:21.858
Give me your phone

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:22.984
Here

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:29.824
Huh?

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.250
Should we order another cocktail then?

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:40.585
Yeah

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.003
Great!

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:44.923
Here!

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.050
Ah, yes

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.941
Hey, where are you going?

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.442
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.281
Do you need anything else?

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.381
Did your class go well?

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.341
Ah...

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:30.801
Yeah

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.639
Today was successful, huh?

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:36.683
Huh?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.227
The hunting

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.526
Of course it was successful

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.654
What did you say your name was again?

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.948
I really can't remember anything

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.618
How can you not remember the name?

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.416
I never told you

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:02.917
Ah, really?

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:04.335
Right?

00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:06.754
Somehow...

00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:08.506
Somehow I couldn't remember

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.341
I didn't ask you, did I?

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.930
Then have fun

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:17.682
Yeah

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.710
Huh?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.002
We didn't call you

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.261
What's this?

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:56.930
Hey, isn't this your wallet?

00:09:57.764 --> 00:09:59.849
Oppa lost his wallet?

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.692
You left it at my place yesterday

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:11.736
Place?
