WEBVTT

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.933
We didn't call you, did we?

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.482
What's this?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.359
Hey, isn't this your wallet?

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.236
Oppa, did you lose your wallet?

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.080
You left it at my place yesterday

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.123
Place?

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.259
Ah..

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.804
We met at the PC cafe yesterday

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.681
Since I recognized you

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.974
We had a drink together

00:00:58.684 --> 00:00:59.768
Oh, really?

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.062
You're quite sociable, huh?

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.064
I greeted you outside earlier

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.401
I should have given it then...

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.735
Why are you giving it to me now?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.657
Let's have a drink together next time

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.033
We come here quite often

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.660
Yes

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.745
You could give us some service now

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.081
I'll bring it right to you

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:26.545
Come out for a moment

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.552
Just wait 10 minutes

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.349
Who are you?

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.227
What do you mean?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.147
Are you trying to embarrass me right now?

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.692
What did I do wrong?

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:52.863
I'm just returning your wallet, what's the problem?

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.120
Seems like there's a misunderstanding

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.330
I'm not gay!

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.584
I'm not like you

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.210
I hope there's no misunderstanding

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.548
Yesterday was a mistake, I drank too much

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.551
You said you didn't remember...

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.554
But you seem to remember everything, don't you?

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.601
You asked if you could stay over

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.352
And I said you could

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.688
I'm just returning your wallet, why?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.524
What's wrong with that?

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.277
Why give it to me in front of everyone!

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.695
Should I call you aside to give it to you then?

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:37.574
Hey! What are you doing there?

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.203
Let's go, the guys are too drunk

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.247
Yeah

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.471
Wow, it's cold..

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.015
Hey, what were you talking about with that guy earlier?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.517
Nothing special

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.268
How old is he?

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.311
Twenty

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.562
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.730
I don't know..

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.774
He's not dating anyone right now

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:11.233
Why?

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.443
He's a student, he's studying for exams

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.153
Oh really?

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.154
Is he retaking the exam?

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.074
But how did you end up drinking

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.493
And you even went to his place

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.995
It's all because of you

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.581
How is it my fault?

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.421
I don't know

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.101
What did you say your name was?

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.895
I really can't remember anything

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.356
I never told you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.733
You said you didn't remember...

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.862
But you seem to remember everything, don't you?

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.309
When was that photo taken?

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.227
In high school

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.480
That's cute

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:36.276
You think I'm cute?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.524
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.026
Nothing

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.319
Did you get a text from Soyoung?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.530
Yes, we're chatting

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.784
Are you going to see her again?

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.746
I think we're going to eat something later

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.248
Just the two of you?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.167
Yeah, you come too

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.174
Hey

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.428
If... hypothetically speaking

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.723
If you had someone you were starting something with

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.729
No, not exactly that

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.983
More like someone you met by chance

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.359
And...

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.568
A kiss?

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:03.989
Yeah, something like that, some physical contact

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:05.991
But the two of you...

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.202
Are an impossible couple

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.121
What would you do?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.331
Did you kiss someone?

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:14.958
Huh?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.835
Did you kiss Soyoung?

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.253
No, keep your voice down

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.296
You're crazy, when?

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:20.630
I didn't!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.007
Then what's the meaning of what you said?

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.216
No, just

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.969
Hypothetically speaking

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.014
Are you really going to date Soyoung?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.516
Well...

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.728
Let's say I am, more or less

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.693
I think I could do better

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:42.902
Why?

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.155
Just because

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.740
Didn't you say it was an impossible couple?

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.702
If it's impossible, you should try harder, until it works

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.749
You think so?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:58.585
Is it because of military service?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:06:59.627
Huh?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.840
Ah... right

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.010
There's military service too

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.888
But hey...

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.015
Isn't that something the other person should decide?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.142
It's not something you can decide just because you like it, right?

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.353
Hey

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:18.646
But the problem is...

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.148
Uh...

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.649
It's that...

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.735
I...

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.781
I'm not even sure

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.574
if I really like them

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.451
It's just a feeling that

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.869
Hey, Jeongwoo

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.497
The fact that you're thinking about this

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.332
and telling me about it is already

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.625
proof that you

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.794
are completely smitten

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.174
Oppa

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.220
Oppa?

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:51.846
Oh sorry

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.849
I saw a pretty cafe nearby

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.017
Do you want to go with me?

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.395
Oppa, you haven't even finished your food

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.813
Ah...

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:03.316
I'm not feeling well today

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.276
Oh, really?

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.195
Yeah...

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.697
I think I'll feel better if I rest a bit

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.908
I'm sorry, can we go next time?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.537
Yes, yes, you should go home

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:18.122
I'll watch you get in a taxi

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:19.874
It's okay

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.167
You're not feeling well, go home first

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.087
Are you sure?

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.381
I'll let you know when the bus comes

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.518
Welcome

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.603
Excuse me, is...

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.229
Um...

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:45.483
Is he working today?

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.609
Ah

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.279
Today Han Gyeol and I

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.779
switched shifts, so he's not here

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:54.783
Do you need something specific?

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.327
No, it's okay

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.453
I'll come again

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.558
What are you doing here?

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:20.518
What?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.897
They said you weren't working today

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.107
My academy is near here

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.318
Ah... really?

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.447
Your academy is quite far from your home

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.118
Why did you come here?

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.621
Ah...

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.122
I was just passing by

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.582
I see...

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:45.167
Then

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.086
Wait

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.880
Um...

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.051
Have you eaten?

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.515
Do you want to have dinner with me if you haven't eaten?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.613
I'm sorry

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.074
I've been thinking

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.618
I was the one who stayed at your place

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.829
You were right

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.002
I was so drunk that day

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.966
I think I felt guilty about my mistake

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.724
What mistake?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.812
You know, everything that happened

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.038
Hey, is this wrong too?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.542
Give me that

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.169
How do you expect to get into Sehan University with this?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.132
Are you good at English?

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.926
Sure, I'm an English specialist

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.095
When is your exam?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.557
The 29th

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.228
Two weeks left

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.814
Do you want me to give you intensive tutoring?

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.284
How much do you charge?

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.121
No, well...

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.748
I'll just help you when I have time

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.124
I'm not going to charge you

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.710
And...

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.920
I have nothing to do until I go to the army

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.505
Ah...

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:57.300
Excuse me?

00:11:58.343 --> 00:11:59.969
You haven't done your military service yet?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.013
Have you done yours?

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.640
Yes, I've done it

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.809
You did it early

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.482
When are you going?

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.234
In a month

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.622
We'll start tomorrow

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.084
The tutoring
