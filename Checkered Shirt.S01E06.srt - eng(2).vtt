WEBVTT

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:03.837
Ah, I just boiled it

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:04.796
You woke up like a ghost

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:05.797
What?

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:06.673
Where are you going?

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.175
I have an appointment

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:09.885
From weekend morning?

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:12.679
Who are you meeting?

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.222
Don't tell me it's Soyoung?!

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.017
I'll be back

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:24.942
Ouch, hot

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.219
Go in first

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.013
There are no seats inside

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:56.598
Oh, really?

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.809
Then...

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.061
Should we do it at home?

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.272
That's why I said let's meet at Kkachisan, right?

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.316
What?

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.985
Then why bother waiting?

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.196
There are a lot of people working here in the cafe

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.990
Seats won't be available easily, right?

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:17.786
Hyung

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.080
Are you always like this?

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:21.456
Huh?

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.960
Like what?

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:28.880
Nothing

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.173
Let's go

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:46.606
Wait here for 5 minutes

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.233
Why?

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.361
My house is messy because I haven't cleaned up

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.656
Come on, we're both guys, what does it matter?

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.786
Want to wait?

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:04.458
Wait

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.975
Did you clean everything?

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:23.643
Yes

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.190
Now, look

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.317
If the sequencing problem is at the end of the text

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.319
It's better to solve the sequencing problem first

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.198
This problem has text after the sequence too, right?

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.701
The conclusion often appears here

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.412
You know Seowon University's transfer English exam

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.206
Is the most difficult one, right?

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:48.919
Yes

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.962
The more difficult it is, what do you need to do?

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.632
You need to approach it strategically

00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:54.674
That's what I'm saying

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.759
And

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.971
Diligently memorizing vocabulary is also important

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.058
If you get something wrong because you don't know words like these

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:04.851
It's really frustrating, isn't it?

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.900
Are you sleepy?

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:14.903
No

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.533
You don't seem to be concentrating?

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:21.868
I am concentrating

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.954
Really?

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:28.875
Hyung

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.755
You're cool

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:35.882
What?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.928
After always seeing you hunting women

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.430
Seeing this now

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.475
You're cool

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:50.021
Really?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.331
You can accept it

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.375
No, it's fine

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.254
Is it...

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.173
Going well?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.302
I'm not interested

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.928
She's not my type either

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.225
What is your type then?

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.814
First of all...

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.692
Fair skin

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.487
Long eyelashes

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.908
Someone who tells me...

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.660
That checkered shirts look good on me

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.500
The woman next to you that time was pretty, wasn't she?

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.338
Do you want me to work things out with her?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.675
That...

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.719
Is up to you

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.890
You can use what you learned from me

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.810
What did I learn?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.066
I don't remember?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.110
Don't lie

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.992
It's true...

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.621
I'll have to teach you again

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.291
Hyung

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.086
Honestly, you're not a virgin, right?

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.129
That's right

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.007
Doesn't seem like it, right?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.427
Then let's say I'm not

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.059
Let's take a short break

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.146
You're tired, aren't you?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.233
No

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.235
It's just that you look tired

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.867
Let's relax for a bit

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:08.952
To do what?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.959
I wanted to draw you

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.336
Suddenly?

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.672
Don't move

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:44.941
Did you sleep well?

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.450
Yes, I slept well

00:08:58.162 --> 00:08:59.330
Good
