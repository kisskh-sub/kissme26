WEBVTT

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.934
I have to leave early because I have a makeup class in the morning

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.144
Let's meet in your neighborhood in the evening

00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:24.106
Eat the sandwich on the table before you go

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:38.264
Tutoring?

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.190
Because they said they want to apply to our school

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.317
What major?

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:51.485
Computer Science

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.030
Umm... so?

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:56.742
Hey, Jeong-woo

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:58.744
You're not dating like you should

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.038
And you're getting antsy before military service

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.081
But this person would be quite expensive, right?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.333
Pardon?

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.543
This Kim tutor has over 20 reviews

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:09.628
Ah, but is that just for math?

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:12.423
That was two years ago

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.927
And nowadays there are many top-notch tutors

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.344
It's hard to find students too

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.599
Anyway, when does it end?

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.976
Ah...

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.853
It's already finished

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:29.106
Oh, it's almost done

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.443
Perfect, let's go drinking

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.235
Didn't you just eat with Minji?

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:34.403
Ah, that's not enough

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.447
You'll come with us, right?

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.159
Why are you bothering someone who's studying?

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.079
Hey, we need to help them relieve some stress

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.331
They'll need energy to study again tomorrow

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.708
Ah, but that place...

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:48.626
No, wait

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.253
Since I'm your senior, I'll speak informally

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.048
This is a secret

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.259
I'm the next student council president for Computer Science at Seowon University

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:00.514
You'll come with us, right?

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.682
Let's go together

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:05.769
I'll pay

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.693
So you're avoiding it on purpose?

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:15.612
Well...

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:17.822
That's part of it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.242
I always hear him criticizing girls

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.452
I thought you did that because you had a girlfriend

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:26.956
Must have high standards

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.085
As expected, handsome guys are different

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:34.673
So what type of girls do you like?

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:36.007
I know all the girls

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.050
in the engineering department

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.510
Don't believe him

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.885
This is almost all bluffing

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.722
Come on, just tell me

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.181
Do you have an ideal type?

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:46.851
Hmm...

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.061
I like

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.313
Someone who's a bit tall

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.648
Tall, and what else?

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:54.985
With a nice figure

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.903
Wow! So you look at the body?

00:03:58.487 --> 00:03:59.530
What else, what else?

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:01.074
And...

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:05.494
Someone who's good at kissing?

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.956
Kissing?

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.878
Hey! Hangyeol, are you in the same department as him?

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.423
So how many people have you dated?

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:17.965
What?

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.135
How many people have you dated since turning twenty?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.931
Well, I've dated a reasonable number

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:28.768
Jeong-woo

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.519
Just learn from him

00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:32.188
I've already learned?

00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:33.648
What?

00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:35.650
I'm joking

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.195
This guy has only a month left before the military

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.072
and I introduced him to my girlfriend's friend

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.824
And lately it's been crazy

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.034
They say late-blooming love is dangerous

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.494
Always smiling with his phone in hand

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.371
And on weekends it's almost like hibernation

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.664
The guy who used to just sleep says he's meeting a girl he likes

00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:52.416
Gets all dressed up and goes out from early morning

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:53.335
When did I ever do that?

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:59.173
So what he's saying...

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.844
Think of it as 90% exaggeration

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.722
Hey, but...

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.681
Honestly, isn't that kind of trashy?

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.643
What do you think, junior?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.311
But...

00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:15.023
Isn't it fine if she knows and is dating you anyway?

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:26.826
If she likes you, she'll wait, right?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.744
Wow...

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.831
You have a real man's mindset, junior

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.085
There are much worse obstacles

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.211
Is that nothing?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.342
Hey! You should just be my brother

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:49.682
Just a moment

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:51.893
Oh, it's Minji

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.567
How touching

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.112
Why can't the senior say a word?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.572
What am I supposed to say?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.199
Seriously!

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:10.954
You're going to get in trouble

00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:14.581
Just a moment, please

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:24.592
Who is it?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.219
Um...

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.681
It's an unknown number

00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.307
Answer it

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.860
I need to go to the bathroom for a moment

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.652
Okay

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:47.782
Hey

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.619
Didn't you meet Soyoung on the weekend?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:53.871
Huh?

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.958
Minji is at Soyoung's house right now

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.751
And she says you've completely disappeared

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.213
I haven't disappeared

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.257
What's going on?

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.887
Haven't you been seeing Soyoung lately?

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.097
I... tutored her

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:13.474
Who?

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:14.641
Her?

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.144
Yes

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:17.771
What about Soyoung?

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.230
You haven't contacted her?

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.483
We finished class late the day before yesterday

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:25.820
I texted her late at night but got no reply

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.615
Contact her, she's waiting for you now

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.242
Ah...

00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:32.994
Yes

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:34.954
What's going on?

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.916
I thought you two were doing well lately

00:07:59.603 --> 00:08:00.146
Huh?

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:01.856
Hello?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.068
Is this Hangyeol?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.278
Hangyeol

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.368
Talk to me

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:18.957
I'm sorry for calling you like this

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:22.836
Do you still live there?

00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:25.171
People said they saw you

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.631
I went to your house

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.466
But you were never there

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.051
Why are you coming to my house?

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.347
Where are you now?

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:36.557
Let's talk face to face

00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:37.725
I'll come to you

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.351
Why would I want to see your face?!

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.358
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:46.650
But...

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.153
I had my reasons too

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.695
I'll explain everything when we meet

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.324
You're saying this now?

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:56.578
Hangyeol

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:57.871
I'm going to block you

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.000
I hope we never cross paths again

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.511
Wow, it's cold

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:28.902
Ah

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:31.529
Where do you live, junior?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:33.948
I live in Kkachisan

00:09:34.364 --> 00:09:34.948
What?

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.161
Hasn't the last train already gone?

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:39.621
Um...

00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:41.079
I can take a taxi

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.164
Taxi?

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:43.416
If there's a late-night surcharge now

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.751
It'll cost more than 50,000 won

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.336
Oh, really?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.712
I don't usually take taxis

00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:50.756
Just stay over at my place
