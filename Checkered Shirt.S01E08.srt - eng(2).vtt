00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.920
You can just sleep in my room

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:05.255
What?

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:07.048
Hey

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.759
Why is this kid sleeping in your room?

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:10.760
Because my room is bigger

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:12.554
No way

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.347
This kid's room is super dirty, seriously

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.224
Just sleep in my room

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.144
Do you have an extra blanket?

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.728
I have one

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.648
Come here

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:25.858
Look at him taking care of his student?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:27.860
Let's go

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.925
Um...

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.885
Am I really sleeping here?

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:52.802
Yes

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.554
Let's sleep together in the bed

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.309
I slept in your bed with you too

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.438
Ah, but Jaesub sunbae also lives here

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:07.442
Sunbae?

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:11.612
You told me to call you that

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:14.992
No, don't worry about him

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.617
No

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.494
Don't even hang out with him

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.876
But is this a single bed?

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:27.670
Yes

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:32.925
It seems a bit narrow

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.139
Isn't that better then?

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.226
Do you have something I can wear?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.146
Just a moment

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:53.572
Will it be too big?

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:57.409
Huh?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.744
Isn't this outdoor clothing?

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.204
It's fine

00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:06.376
It's pretty

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.146
Wait

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.034
But who is it?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.579
What?

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.041
The person you were talking to earlier

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:34.588
Just...

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.300
Someone I know

00:03:40.344 --> 00:03:42.179
Just someone I know...

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.851
Why do you look so upset?

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.652
Is it the person from that life shot?

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.117
Seems like I'm right

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:05.911
Ex-boyfriend?

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.289
Just

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.916
We dated briefly

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.597
Is it over?

00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:28.393
What?

00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:33.440
Can I stop asking?

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.360
It's a waste of time...

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.240
Well, I am curious

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.244
But...

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.206
Even talking about it now is a waste of time

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.389
I like you

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.934
Hangyeol

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.019
Hyung

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:15.940
Will you go out with me?

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.286
Ah, I didn't think Jeongwoo oppa was like that

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.579
That's too much

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.581
Doing this now when you're going to the military

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.958
I feel a bit sorry about it

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.876
Then why did you ask me to introduce you to someone?

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.795
I encouraged him a bit from the side

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.713
Sorry

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.382
For awkwardly being in the middle

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.177
And you have time for tutoring?

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.806
Ah, how was that person yesterday?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.181
Hangyeol?

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.224
Yeah

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.809
Is he really coming to our school?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.144
Yeah, he said he's applying

00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:54.896
Why?

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.065
Is he from Donghan University?

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.275
Donghan University?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.193
Is that so?

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.320
He just said he lives near Kachisan

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.697
I only know that he's an art student

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.155
He's an art student?

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.117
Yeah, why?

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:09.411
No, I...

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.786
Among my former classmates

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:12.371
I have a friend at Donghan University

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:13.498
And that friend previously

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.625
Showed me something that was posted on Everytime

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.253
And he looks a bit like the person I saw there

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.670
Hangyeol?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:21.047
Yes

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.257
He was even in art school

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.467
What was the post about?

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:45.530
Hyung

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:47.990
I'll go first

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.626
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.512
Ha...

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:12.556
This is driving me crazy

00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:30.949
That's it for today...

00:07:33.577 --> 00:07:35.954
Call me when you wake up

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:22.961
Hangyeol!

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:32.929
What?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.015
Stop avoiding me and talk to me

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:38.600
Let go

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.395
No, it'll just take a moment, just a moment

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:42.814
I said let go!

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:54.617
Hi

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:56.161
Huh?

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:03.667
I have class, so I'll get up first

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.765
What's going on?

00:09:18.807 --> 00:09:20.310
Did you two fight?

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:21.435
Huh?

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:23.395
No

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:28.734
Then why is the atmosphere like this?

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:30.360
It's nothing

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.570
What's with the atmosphere?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.407
You're super awkward right now

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:36.158
Yeah

00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:39.203
Yeah, yeah

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.631
Jeongwoo

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:52.926
You...

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.177
Do you

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.346
have something you're hiding from me?

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.557
Hiding?

00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:06.689
You and Lee Hangyeol...

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:09.609
Are you dating?

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:11.569
Huh?
