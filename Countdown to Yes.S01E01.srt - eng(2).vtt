WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
(Episode 1)

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.830
Alright, good work.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.590
My bad.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.340
Have fun at your club activities.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.070
- Oh, good luck.
- Do your best!

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.870
We met ten years ago.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
(Photography Club Summer Exhibition)
(September 4, 2015)

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580
It was right after summer vacation,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.180
on a hot day.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.210
I was captivated by a photo.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.500
('Grandpa and Grandma')
(Class 1-C, Yokoi Minato)

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.589
Yokoi Minato.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.670
Yes?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.610
What?

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.520
You called my name.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.480
Oh, did you take this?

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.120
I really love this photo of yours.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.900
Oh, I'm Nakano Wataru from Class 1-B.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.670
Do you have any others?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.580
- I do.
- Show me next time.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720
Huh?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.500
Was that... a rejection?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.990
You really had the guts to talk to him?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.180
Hm?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.230
Don't you think Yokoi-kun is a bit scary?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.500
Really?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.200
Well... he doesn't come to the club much.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.250
Even when he does, he barely talks.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.010
I don't know what he's thinking.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.850
You don't know?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.410
Because you barely come to
the club either, Nakano-kun.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.030
I'm not very good at
taking photos with everyone.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.690
I guess I prefer taking photos alone.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.420
But just looking at his photos,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.880
he doesn't seem like a scary person.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.090
Yokoi Minato.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.530
Yeah.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060
The club magazine!

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.460
We were going to display it too.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.820
I'll go get it from the club room.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.810
- Want me to help?
- No, it's fine.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.310
Huh?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080
Wataru.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.660
This.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.280
It was in the club room.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.370
You went to get this?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.699
You should've said something!

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
Huh?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
Thanks.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.430
I don't really know much
about photography techniques.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520
Don't laugh at me.

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.130
I wont laughing at you.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.580
You use film?

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.190
I use the camera my grandpa gave me.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.230
You're completely
different from how you look.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.260
I'm not sure how to describe it,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.740
but I think you have something
more important than skill, Minato.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.200
You used my first name...

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.370
It was you who called
me by my first name first.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.680
Let's go take photos together next time.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.430
Okay.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.070
After that,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.270
the two of us often went
out to take photos together.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.260
How nostalgic.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.060
You took some great shots.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.770
And this one.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520
Oh, wow.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.596
This is the one I took
inside the concrete pipe.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.740
Concrete pipe?

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820
Yeah.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.980
Hey, Minato.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.750
Hm?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.179
If we get into university,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.616
do you want to rent a place together?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.700
You're moving out?

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.533
Commuting for over an hour
by train every day is tiring.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.730
- I mean, I can commute.
- True...

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.060
- If we're packed on the train every day...
- Besides,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.860
if we live together, we can
see each other every day, right?

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.590
Huh?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.096
Am I the only one who wants to see you?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.330
No way.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.790
I was just surprised.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.620
So that's how it is.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.600
After getting into university,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.220
we moved to Tokyo together,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.250
and lived in that room.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.469
It's burnt!

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.470
Uh...

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.720
Don't lie, it must be bitter.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.580
It's fine.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.000
No... it's terrible.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.010
- Ugh...
- How about the miso soup?

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.190
It's good.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480
(December 21, 2019)
Even though we both had girlfriends,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.260
somehow,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.770
we still spent more time together.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.860
Thanks for waiting.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.180
Alright then,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.720
to celebrate Minato's birthday,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.969
and our first time drinking together,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.380
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.170
Oh, right.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760
Hold the cake.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.620
Okay.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.930
Look at the camera.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.610
You're 20 now, so that means...

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.130
we've known each other for five years?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.850
Time flies.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.210
Yeah, it does.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.019
But it's still eight months
and sixteen days away.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.903
That's way too exact.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.030
September 4th.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.900
You have a good memory.

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:37.490
Let's celebrate our
tenth year together too.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.603
Tenth year? Twenty-five years old?

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.160
Hey, will we still be together then?

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.140
Hey, idiot.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.570
You should drink slowly at first.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.750
Want some water?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.860
Yes.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.520
Okay, I'll get it right away.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.980
Thanks.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.620
In our tenth year, I'll
still be by Wataru's side.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.110
That's not convincing at all.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.550
Ah.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.590
- Are you shy?
- No way.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.590
You're drooling.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
No, I'm not.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.910
You lose it as soon as you drink.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.060
I'm not even drunk yet.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.370
Really?

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.510
At that time, I thought I hope I can
still be by your side ten years from then.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.690
It's dangerous to chug it like that.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.100
(March 20, 2022)

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.150
Is early spring in Hokkaido really that cold?

00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:03.249
When we traveled there before,
it was surprisingly warm, wasn't it?

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.700
That's because we went in summer.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.480
Before you go to work, have someone teach
you how to survive in a snowy land.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.490
Can I take this?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.580
Oh, the one I made?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.910
What is it?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.550
You'll be lonely.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.520
I really like this.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.610
Then... I'll take this one.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.040
Go on, hurry.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.240
You'll miss your flight.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920
Okay.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
Well then,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.920
I'll leave the lease termination to you.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Okay.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.510
Take care.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.150
You too, Minato.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.840
The yogurt you made,

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.460
I'll eat it every day.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.030
Let me hug you.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.030
I'm leaving now.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.090
I spent with four years with
my best friend in that room.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.430
Up until we graduated from university,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.420
that room was our home.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.870
I thought... it would always be like this.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
Huh?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.590
So... I actually liked him.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.280
Later, we grew apart.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.710
Perhaps it was for the best.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.370
That's what I think now.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.110
If I had stayed by his side,

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.370
I definitely

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.000
wouldn't have been able to
stop myself from falling for him.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
(September 4, 2025)

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.020
Mm-hmm.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.970
Good.

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:01.342
Wonderful.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840
You two.

00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:07.241
Please look at each other lovingly.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.860
Think about making
this person happy for life.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:12.885
That's too much.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.910
This is so embarrassing.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.240
Don't be embarrased.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.550
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.700
It's quite emotional.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.250
I never thought I'd be
photographed by Wataru.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480
Congratulations.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.616
How many times are you going to say that?

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.100
You can never say it enough.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.830
How many years has it been?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.340
Since we first met.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.160
If we count from when we were
in the same class in high school...

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.600
Ten years.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.600
Shouldn't we get everyone together soon?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.730
Yeah.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.199
Ebi-chan and Fuji are both in Tokyo.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.010
It's pretty easy to meet up with them.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.720
But Minato...

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.520
Hokkaido is really far.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.690
How's that guy doing lately?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.900
Is he doing well in the north?

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.890
I don't know.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.030
We haven't been in touch much lately.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.160
That's surprising.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.820
Weren't you two always inseparable?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.510
Oh, how thoughtful.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.250
Manager.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.810
Your friends' photos today were great.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.970
Why don't we display them
after they're developed?

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.480
Huh? Really?

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.100
Yeah, but only if
you get their permission.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.256
That's great!

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.440
You can leave work early today.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640
Good work.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.220
Huh? Is it that late already?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.640
Ten years since we met.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.000
(Shioiri Kouhei: Thank you for today!
(I'm so glad you took my wedding photos!)

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.460
But you

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.550
weren't by my side.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.700
(Minato calling)

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.780
What's up?

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.450
It's been a while.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.640
Oh, it's been a while.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.790
It's been a while since
I've been back here.

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.020
So, what's up?

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.330
You're in Kanagawa?

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.530
Yeah, just arrived.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.170
Why?

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.550
I've been transferred to headquarters.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.730
Transferred?

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.970
So,

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.660
I'm coming back here.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.400
Why didn't you say so sooner?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.200
Aren't I saying it now?

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.410
That's not what I meant.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.820
You should've told me beforehand!

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.350
Are you free to meet up now?

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.570
No?

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.550
Where are you?

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.070
Don't get too excited.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.920
Minato and I are just friends.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.100
Friends.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.330
Just friends.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.470
Ah.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.590
Let me hug you.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.320
What?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440
To recharge.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.130
Mm.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.920
You suddenly showing up surprised me.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.530
Shouldn't I be saying that?

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.990
By the way, why were
you suddenly transferred?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.620
I won an internal company
proposal competition,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.410
and was assigned to the
headquarters' project team.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.220
Assigned, huh?

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.169
Assigned as the person
in charge? That's great.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.650
Not exactly in charge, more like...

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.740
Huh? No?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.750
I'm in charge of planning and development.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.339
What I mean by assigned is...

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.600
Ah, I get it.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.210
Anyway, you were praised
for being 'amazing, ' right?

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.586
Since I was the one who proposed it,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.010
I was chosen to be part
of the team executing it.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.660
I see.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.020
So, you're the chosen Minato.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.750
That's right.

00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:50.990
The chosen Minato.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.110
Why don't you just use a spoon?

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.100
It wouldn't feel right.

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:06.996
- That's why I said use a spoon...
- A fork is cooler, right?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.560
I feel like

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.360
it's just like when we used
to see each other every day.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.180
Yeah, it doesn't feel like
it's been a long time at all.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.470
Right.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.300
Wataru.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.730
Hm?

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.470
In our tenth year,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.910
I'm still by your side after all.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.820
When we first drank beer...

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.040
I remember, I remember it clearly.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.840
Being by your side is the best after all.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.090
Huh?

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.536
Is there something you're not happy about?

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560
No.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.050
Ugh, I ate too much.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.690
It was worth getting seconds.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.660
My stomach is completely full.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.460
How about the rest of the
day? Going back home?

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.690
Yeah.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.850
Then let's say goodbye here.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.090
Let's find time to eat together again soon.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.180
See ya.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.890
Wataru.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.350
Hm?

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.410
Do you want to

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.960
live with me?

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.650
Huh?

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.300
"Countdown To Yes"

00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:00.464
(What is cohabitation?)

00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:01.430
(To live together as a couple ...people who are
not in a romantic relationship living together...)

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.700
(Next Episode Preview)
A couple...?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.040
Minato is a friend.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.410
Minato is a friend.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.740
Wataru is special.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.790
I guess that's why
I like the photos Minato takes.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280
Are you mad?

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.360
I just like it.
