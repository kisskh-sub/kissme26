00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280
What do you think? Pretty handsome, right?

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.519
Because he's too outstanding,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.280
he was recommended by HR again.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280
And again, it's President Qin's personal pick.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.280
It seems

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.640
Secretary Lin's competition has finally appeared.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.000
Competition?

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.000
What does that count for?

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.879
President Qin,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400
Here, take a look.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.439
Look at this.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.719
Do you understand?

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.319
You need to compare it with last month's hit product.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.039
Understood.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.919
So it needs to include these.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.439
Now look at this.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.759
All data needs to be subtotaled by category.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.520
What's going on?

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.000
Bring it to me when you're done.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.240
Do you understand now?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.439
See?

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.680
Okay.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.280
Crisis.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.520
Crisis? What crisis?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
Secretary Lin.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.560
President Qin.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.719
She asked me to request from you

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.159
her recent schedule.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.800
His eyes are somewhat big,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.599
but they can't compare to my sword-like brows and starry eyes.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.919
His nose bridge is high,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.599
but it's just average.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.199
Nothing like my nose, as straight as a mountain peak,

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.439
giving a sense of firmness.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.520
And thin lips.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.479
They may seem sexy,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.520
but are far less defined than the strong lines of my lips.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.680
A well-defined face

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.120
is only good at first glance.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.159
It can't compare to my

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.719
features, as if meticulously carved by a master,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.840
with every line perfectly in place.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.479
In short, in terms of looks,

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.960
I completely crush him.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.039
Secretary Lin?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.360
Sorry,

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.000
President Qin asked me to request

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.080
the schedule from you.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.240
His personality is just simply cheerful and outgoing.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.800
Not as decisive and resolute as mine.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520
A young person being overly enthusiastic

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.599
only comes off as flighty.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
While my steadiness

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.800
is the key to victory.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.400
Patience is fine,

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.719
but you can't judge a book by its cover.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.080
Who knows what's beneath that patience?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.520
Could be harboring ill intentions.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.360
Seems in terms of personality,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.520
I also win completely.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.599
Secretary Lin.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.240
Secretary Lin!

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.840
Okay.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.960
I'll send it to your email later.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.520
Thank you.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.120
Nice to meet you.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.919
For President Qin's work in the future,

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.520
please feel free to assign it to me.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.280
I'm happy to learn from you.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.879
It's not just a crisis anymore.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.319
It's precarious.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.240
Secretary Lin,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.720
do you have a moment now?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.160
I still need to ask you

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.759
about how President Qin likes her coffee.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.160
Alright.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.519
Here.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.319
Secretary Lin,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.000
President Qin's taste

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.120
is this strong?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.120
Yes.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.480
So I'll trouble you

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.600
to grind more beans.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.519
I see.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.319
Thanks.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.160
President Qin,

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.199
your coffee.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.560
How is it?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.839
Good.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.399
She didn't even get angry?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.079
We were worried about President Qin,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.839
now we should worry about Secretary Lin.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.959
Yeah.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:03.000
After all, a secretary can be replaced anytime.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.600
So you need a few backups.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.160
Should we hold the Strategy Meeting?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.759
Not yet.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.000
Okay, no rush.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.199
If you put it that way,

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.920
bro,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.319
you're in a precarious spot.

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:23.759
What do you mean?

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.480
Look at you.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.040
Your physique: 90 points.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.839
Looks: 90 points.

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:30.920
Charm: 90 points.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.000
Ability: 90 points.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.360
As for personality,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.040
90 points.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.800
So in every aspect,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.519
you're already top-tier.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:42.399
A 90-point man.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.839
You...

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:44.800
Of course.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:47.800
90 points?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.639
It's 100 points.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.279
That's not right.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.120
You need to leave yourself some

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.560
room for improvement.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.439
And then?

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.879
As for this Li Yi,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.439
let me assess him.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.199
Looks: 90 points.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.160
Physique: 90 points.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.079
Ability: 90 points.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:10.199
Charm: 90 points.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.079
His personality must be 90 points too.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.879
Just like you, a 90-point man.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.319
He deserves that?

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.439
Why wouldn't he?

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:20.639
You can't treat someone like an extra

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.240
just because they have fewer scenes.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.079
A supporting character

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.040
is still a person.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.439
Then go on.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.399
No personal bias.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.360
He has one very important bonus point

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.079
that you don't have.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.199
What is it?

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.959
It's...

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.879
Novelty.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.879
Fresh.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.360
Fresh meat. Fresh.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:45.519
You don't have it.

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.079
Hey, boss.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.480
I understand.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.160
Are you angry?

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.000
Being petty, huh?

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.759
You're a 95.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.959
120.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.360
Can't go any higher.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.680
A 120-point man.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:16.240
The most impressive.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.759
Because it was a last-minute decision

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.879
to go on a business trip overseas,

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:23.639
so

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.720
I had to find someone

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.279
without a language barrier.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.240
Isn't it because I saw you've been working too hard lately?

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.800
I wanted you to rest a few more days.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.080
And he's not tired?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.159
Who?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.320
That flashy but useless Secretary Li.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.000
Oh, you mean Secretary Li?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.919
He's new.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.600
But...

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.559
Did I dial the wrong number?

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:47.799
Is this still the same

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.399
Secretary Lin who rarely even raises his voice?

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:49.919
Open the door.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.480
What?

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.440
Open the door, now.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.759
Secretary Lin, how did you...

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.120
Is my name Secretary Lin?

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.080
Do I just go by Secretary Lin?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.519
To you, am I just like all the other Secretaries Zhao,

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.679
Secretaries Zhang, and Secretaries Li?

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.759
Don't I have my own name?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.639
To make sure you don't forget,

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:16.840
I have to remind you.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.240
I am your boyfriend.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.080
One and only.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.200
You are my boyfriend.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.399
But...

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:24.039
What?

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.360
Need some novelty now?

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.679
So you're looking for a younger secretary?

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.960
Does a fish that just took the bait

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.159
no longer need to be fed?

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.120
Do I look ridiculous?

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:38.559
What are you laughing at?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.519
Stop laughing.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.039
I never thought

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.080
the always so polite Secretary Lin

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.960
could be so scary when jealous.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.799
Are you teasing me?

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.519
Are you that

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.320
lacking in confidence?

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:58.679
My dear Secretary Lin.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.799
Let go of me.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.679
Let me go.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.320
My shoe came off.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.200
You're really angry.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.799
Is this better?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.039

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.559

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.200
Is this better now?
