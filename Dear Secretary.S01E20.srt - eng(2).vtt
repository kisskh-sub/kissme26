WEBVTT

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.400
Old Wang

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.359
Turn left ahead and take the other road.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.519
But that road...

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.680
Let's just go this way.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.760
Okay.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.599
Strange.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.120
Why not go straight?

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.120
That road has twice as many traffic lights.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.560
You didn't know that?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.359
Lovers who are about to part

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.519
always wish for a few more red lights on the road.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.040
You mean President Qin and Secretary Lin?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.799
Why else do you think I'm tagging along?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.719
Secretary Lin really has a strong sense of crisis.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.799
Don't worry, Secretary Lin.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.439
I'll definitely take good care of President Qin.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.080
Oh, I mean *we*.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.199
Xiao Xue and I will definitely take good care of President Qin.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.120
Wait for me to come back.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.840
Meili.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.840
When you come back...

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.759
marry me.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.319
Seeing how close you two are,

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.519
I wonder if you'd like to put your photo on the wall?

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.680
I don't want to.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.560
Why don't you want to?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360
Do you think it's unfair?

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.040
Or are you ashamed to be with me?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.879
That's not it.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.040
Then why?

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.600
No reason.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.480
I just don't want to.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.319
We came out to have fun,

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.759
don't be such a killjoy.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560
I'm not.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.279
It's just putting up a photo.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.600
I just don't want to.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
Goodbye, Secretary Lin.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.680
Why are you back?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.360
Because I didn't want you to regret it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.759
So I came back early.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.079
Secretary Lin...

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.560
You really are still so clingy.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.959
Do you regret it?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.720
Silly.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.360
Okay.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.080
What's wrong?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.000
Nothing.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.000
I have something to do later.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.840
You go to work first by yourself.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.519
Come in.

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:22.240
Thank you.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.200
Sister Meili.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.360
Little Brother Lin.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.440
You have to be good.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.480
When you grow up,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.120
it'll be your turn to protect your sister.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.360
Let's pinky promise.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.679
What is it?

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.879
I've been here before.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.039
Let's go in.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.039
Miss Qin.

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.919
I'm sorry for asking you to meet here.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:53.840
It's fine.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.399
You people from the Lin family

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.519
all like to arrange talks with people.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.600
I'm used to it.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.120
That's my son, Dahai.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.000
I assume you've met him?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.320
The matters here

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.480
are complicated to explain.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.200
In short,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.559
I asked you here today

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:11.360
for the matter concerning you and my son,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.679
Lin Han.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.799
Auntie, if you have something to say,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960
please speak frankly.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.200
I don't want you two to be together.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.480
What do you mean?

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:26.480
Personally, I have

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.120
absolutely no issue with you, Miss Qin.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.960
On the contrary,

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.600
I quite admire

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.399
a girl with your personality.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.080
But,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.679
you're not suitable for each other.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.799
You should know

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.000
Lin Han is to inherit the Lin Group.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.320
He is the Lin Group's only hope.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.799
He cannot

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.240
be your secretary forever.

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:47.559
You'll realize later

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.080
your dependence on him outweighs your love.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:53.679
Plus, this child, Xiao Hai...

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.240
his current condition

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.000
has us very worried.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.360
In short,

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.440
break up.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.240
It's for the best for everyone.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.799
That child, Xiao Hai...

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:08.000
He's over thirty and you still call him a child?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.720
Auntie,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.320
are you raising a man-child?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.559
And I'd like to ask,

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.279
if we break up,

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.039
exactly who is it good for?

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:18.639
Since you say it's good for everyone,

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:19.879
then who is 'everyone'?

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:20.960
Is it me?

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.440
Is it Lin Han?

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:24.000
Is it you and uncle?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.679
Or is it him, Lin Hai?

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.639
I asked you to come here

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.759
precisely to let you see Xiao Hai.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.600
Because of you being with Xiao Han,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.519
see what he's become.

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.039
Yes.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.519
I see him.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.200
And so?

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:37.159
What does that have to do with me?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.120
Lin Han!

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.639
Son!

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.200
Lin Han!

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.200
Calm down!

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.440
Lin Han!

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.000
Son!

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.480
Lin Han! Lin Han!

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:48.799
You see?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.279
He is my son.

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:51.960
He was perfectly normal.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.279
It's because you're with his brother

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.679
Let me ask again,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.600
what does this have to do with me?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.639
Miss Qin,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.759
you may not understand,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.360
but as a mother...

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:07.480
Yes.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:09.360
You, as a mother.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.720
So for the sake of your eldest son,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.960
you let your younger son

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.720
suffer grievances for over twenty years.

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.200
And now you want him to sacrifice his own happiness too?

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:19.919
Is this something a mother would do?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.399
What do you mean by that?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.200
Am I wrong?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.039
Lin Han's former name

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.639
was Lin Hai, wasn't it?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.799
How do you know about this?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.120
Mistakenly swapping

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.639
his own role with his brother's,

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.080
seeing himself as the victim.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.480
This is an excessive sense of guilt

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.720
over his own actions.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.360
It can cause serious psychological disorders.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.320
My suggestion is,

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:01.159
for now,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.039
it's best not to provoke him.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.080
He wants to hurt me!

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.440
He wants to hurt me!

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.399
He wants to hurt me!

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:07.879
He wants to hurt me!

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:09.000
No one wants to hurt you.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.279
Don't be like this.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.440
No one wants to hurt you.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.240
Stop it.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.279
Xiao Hai.

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:17.600
I'm not Lin Han.

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:18.720
I'm not Lin Han.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:19.840
Lin Han is the bad guy.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:20.919
Lin Han is the bad guy.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.480
Mom, I'm Lin Hai.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.440
I'm Lin Hai.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.480
I'm Lin Hai.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.360
You're Lin Hai.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320
It's Mom's fault.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.639
It's all Mom's fault.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.240
Mom is sorry.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.000
Then we'll have to leave it at that for now.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.240
Frankly,

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.440
the other child doesn't remember either.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.440
I think

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.639
for now,

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:48.600
stabilizing the eldest son's condition

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.480
is the best course.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:50.480
Alright.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:51.679
Thank you, Doctor.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:54.759
I've been with Lin Han day and night for three years.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.960
What he is capable of,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.600
and what he is not,

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.600
I have eyes.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.759
I can see for myself.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.720
And as his mother,

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:04.879
I will give you the respect you deserve.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.399
But if you expect him to keep

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.399
sacrificing himself endlessly,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.279
even if he's willing,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.399
I absolutely will not allow it.

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:14.600
What you're saying...

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.679
Has my temper, Qin Meili's,

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:17.279
been too good lately?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.279
How dare someone make

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.639
such an unreasonable demand of me?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.879
Do I look like the kind of person

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:24.919
who would sacrifice her own happiness

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.840
just to keep the peace,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.320
for your sake, mine, or everyone's?

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.639
You...

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:30.440
It seems what I said

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.919
to your eldest son before

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.720
needs repeating now.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:36.120
In this world,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.639
aside from me,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.159
no one,

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.679
is allowed to bully my man.

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.840
In case you still don't understand,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.120
let me emphasize:

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.759
Among that "no one,"

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:46.799
includes you.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.360
As for Lin Hai,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.519
he

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:50.840
has nothing

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.360
to do with me.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.759
You don't really think

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.480
Lin Han remembers nothing, do you?
