WEBVTT

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.159
Older brother

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.879
What's wrong?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.560
What's wrong?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.439
Why are you crying?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.120
Why are you crying?

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.319
Xiao Hai

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.400
Are you okay?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.040
Xiao Hai

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.560
I'm Xiao Hai.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.719
Right.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.920
You are Xiao Hai.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.879
How could you forget again?

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.719
You are Xiao Hai.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.159
Are you okay?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.959
You little brat!

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.159
You tricked me into going to the amusement park.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.359
I'll smash you!

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.560
You child!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.159
How are you getting more and more out of line?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.560
You're all helping him.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.280
Bullying me.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.359
You don't like me, you like him.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.680
We don't dislike you.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.159
Mom and Dad both like you.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.759
I was wrong, okay?

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.000
Mom.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.360
No.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.000
You weren't wrong.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.199
It was Mom's fault.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.719
Mom didn't take good care of you.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.039
Does it still hurt?

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.639
Son, stop messing around.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.800
Let go of me!

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.599
Let go! I want to get out!

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.680
Get inside!

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.159
Let me out!

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.960
Let me out!

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.759
I don't want to be here!

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.520
Don't want to be here!

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.919
Let me out!

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.280
Let me out!

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.319
Mom!

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.439
Mom!

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.879
It's not your fault.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.960
Let me out, quick!

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.560
What should we do?

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.840
I think...

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.719
We should send Xiao Hai away first.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.120
Let the two brothers be apart for a while.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.719
It's better for both of them this way.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.719
About that incident in the past...

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.120
I've never blamed you for it.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.240
So you don't need to blame yourselves either.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.639
After all, all these years...

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.879
You've always been by my side.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.879
But older brother only had himself.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.680
Since you know...

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.599
Why didn't you say it sooner?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.919
Because I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.360
An older brother who couldn't face himself...

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.960
And parents caught between their two sons...

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.319
Mom and Dad in a difficult position.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.599
I didn't want you to get hurt again.

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.439
Then...

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.080
That girl...

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.080
What do you plan to do?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.639
Girl?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.199
I mean Qin Meili.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.639
That girl from the Qin family.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.080
I remember when I picked you up as a kid...

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.400
I saw her once.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.960
Later...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.240
When you went to work at the Qin Group...

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.800
I was very worried...

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:11.199
That she would recognize you.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.120
Seeing her again today...

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.000
She said she's always remembered that incident.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.879
She just never asked you about it.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.959
I haven't yet...

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.800
You've met her?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.920
You've met Meili?

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.959
Yes.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.480
She's quite an impressive young lady.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.600
With just a few words...

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.439
She left your mother speechless.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.079
She was just short of swearing.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.959
My son's taste is indeed unique.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.120
One in a million.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.240
She is formidable.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.639
Secretary Lin has gone home.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800
He wouldn't...

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.800
Secretary Lin?

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.759
Meili.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.240
Let's break up.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.079
You know...

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.639
I have to consider my family's feelings.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.720
I've been very happy with you this time.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.319
But I have to do this.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.560
I'm sorry.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.079
Oh dear, what should I do?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.839
The Lin family definitely wouldn't put in a good word for me.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.680
And he's such a self-sacrificing person.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.079
I need to think of a way.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.319
What to do?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.040
Maybe I should just...

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.959
Meili.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.920
I...

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:04.959
Han.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.800
Please don't leave me, okay?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.839
Things that make you angry...

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.079
I'll never do them again.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.839
Secretary Li, right?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.040
I'll fire him immediately.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.079
I only want you.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:14.120
My Han.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.360
No, no, no.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.439
That definitely won't work.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.519
I could never do something like that.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.920
That's not my style either.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.480
My style should be...

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.639
Meili.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.839
I am...

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.800
I've moved all your things here.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.079
Starting today...

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.319
You will live here.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.680
Without my permission...

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.199
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.600
Understood?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.959
That's the plan.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.680
I'll go right now.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.040
Meili.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.639
Secretary Lin.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.759
Meili.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.439
I want to tell you something.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.800
He's probably planning to move back home.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.160
That's why he has a suitcase.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.560
It is on the way home from here.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.720
Even breaking up with me was just "on the way."

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.000
It seems there's no hope at all.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.920
If I had known...

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.040
I should have made a good impression...

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.399
On the Lin family today.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.319
What should I do?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.600
I think...

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.040
Break up.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.240
I, Qin Meili, am about to be dumped.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.199
Can I move in with you?

00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.319
I've made up my mind

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.480
to be with her.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.360
It's best to let that matter end here.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.879
This time,

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:08.439
I won't

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.560
Please don't blame me.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.279
Do you really like her that much?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.079
She's the one who made me realize

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.079
that instead of considering everyone,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.839
I should fight for myself first.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.560
I won't give her up for anyone.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.759
This matter,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.560
please don't waste any more thought on it.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.000
Xiao Hai...

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.720
Dad forgot.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.320
My name is Lin Han.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.080
Dad supports you.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.600
Go be with that Qin Meili.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.879
My son

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.240
deserves a girl like that.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:51.559
Really.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320
You agree?

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:54.679
Really.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.679
Even though she has a bad temper

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.279
and says harsh things,

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.879
we really like her.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.279
And we're also proud

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.600
that my son

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.639
has earned her affection.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.679
Treasure it, son.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.720
Then...

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:10.679
What about older brother?

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.919
I'll accompany him

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.480
to find the best doctor.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.879
It's what I owed him before.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.679
Don't worry.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.519
Let us

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.679
face it openly.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:25.080
Go pursue your happiness.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.559
Son.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.080
Mom and Dad both support you.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.679
Because the nights are just too long.

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.000
I can't bear

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.120
a single minute without Miss Meili.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.080
Can I live here?

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.720
Live here?

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.320
It's not entirely impossible.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.799
But I have conditions.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:50.960
First,

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.679
your access does not include my bedroom.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.639
Second,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.600
you must take care of all my daily needs.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.399
Third,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.559
you must be available at my beck and call.

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:03.279
And you can't easily leave my sight.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.399
But the first and third rules contradict each other.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.279
Is that so?

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.440
Then it's that during the day,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.559
you can't enter my bedroom.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.080
But at night you can.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.320
No!

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.960
I mean,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.600
you can't appear in my bedroom at night.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.480
But during the day you ca-

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:26.279
I haven't finished!

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.519
Meili.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.960
I've decided not to resign.

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:33.759
Not resign?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.039
Because during your business trip these past two days,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.000
I kept thinking...

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.519
Actually, the one who can't be apart from you

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.440
has always been me.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.840
I can't leave you.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480
Not for a day, an hour,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.840
not even a minute or a second.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:00.399
From back then until now,

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:03.799
it's you who has always given me courage.

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.440
I just want to stay by your side forever.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.159
Back then,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.960
twenty years ago on the Ferris wheel...

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.519
You...

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.879
I can finally face that experience.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:33.000
After twenty years,

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.919
riding the Ferris wheel again,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.600
looking at the one I love before me,

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.639
there's no more of that fear.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.279
Only peace.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:42.600
Don't be afraid.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.039
Fortunately,

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.320
she is still the same

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.240
kind sister who got me through my darkest time.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.120
Thank you.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.679
Meili.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.919
From the moment I decided

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.000
to be with you,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.879
I secretly vowed

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:04.080
I would never let go of this hand holding yours.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.000
Just like our first pinky promise.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.960
Thank you, Sister Meili.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.320
Little Brother Lin.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320
You have to be good.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.919
When you grow up, it'll be your turn to protect me.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.039
Let's pinky promise.

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:32.960
Then what about the Lin family business?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.159
Then we'll have to trouble Old Lin

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.559
to retire a few years later.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.919
Are you sure about this?

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:58.600
Wait a minute.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.320
Don't tell me

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.320
you're still worried about Secretary Li?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.360
Not just Secretary Li.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.559
I'm also worried about Secretary Zhang,

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:08.320
Secretary Wang...

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.879
I'm worried about all the secretaries.

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:11.840
But,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.919
the one I worry about most is still you.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.240
What is there to worry about with me?

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.440
I'm hungry.

00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:22.759
Go make me something to eat.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:23.879
You didn't eat dinner?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.840
Okay.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.519
Wait for me.
