WEBVTT

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.920
You all go ahead and prepare.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:34.959
Thank you.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.000
This is the first time you've thanked me.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.319
Is that so?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840
Is everything ready?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.200
How do I look today?

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.719
Absolutely stunning.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.920
Let's go.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.359
It's starting.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.000
This is our company's most important

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.359
event for the second half of the year.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.680
Absolutely.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:02.599
It took so long

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.799
to develop this new product.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.680
We must achieve a complete victory.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240
Our Qin Group's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000
newly launched Beautiful Home Collection

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360
combines traditional craftsmanship with modern fashion.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840
We are committed to providing consumers

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.400
with higher quality products.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.199
First is this designer sofa.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.400
Its inspiration comes from...

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.080
This product is plagiarized!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.520
Plagiarism?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.240
What?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.960
This is Hongmu Group's original product!

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.039
It can't be.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.759
Maybe it's true.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.039
Secretary Lin, this...

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.599
Secretary Li, have security immediately

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.080
check that person's entry credentials.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.919
Secretary Xue.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.240
Record the live stream and all comments as evidence.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.400
Our Qin Group's

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.439
products are all original designs.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.439
Sir,

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.719
you're making baseless accusations of plagiarism.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.919
Do you have any proof?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.800
Secretary Lin.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.520
Cici.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.599
Go to the design department immediately

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.719
and retrieve the design sketches.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.800
Okay.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.360
Titi.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680
Check the secretary's email immediately.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.120
Capture the cloud drive timestamps for designer file exchanges.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.080
Okay.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.919
Haha.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.879
Look into Hongmu Group's

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.360
all similar products from the last three years.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.840
Okay.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.240
Chichi.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.400
Contact the designer.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520
Have him provide a written statement and sign it.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.879
Once everyone is done,

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.039
send it to me immediately.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.879
Okay, understood.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.159
Of course I have evidence.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.199
Are you willing to confront it right here?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.599
I never expected this.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.360
See?

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.520
This is a product from Hongmu Group

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.039
that started pre-sales in physical stores

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.759
last week.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.879
The two sofas look

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.360
identical in appearance.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.479
It's been investigated.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.319
It's a false accusation.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.680
Repeat after me.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.159
Everyone, please look.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.879
The photo provided by this gentleman

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.800
does bear some resemblance

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.319
to our new product.

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.639
Everyone, please look.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.280
The photo provided by this gentleman

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.520
is indeed somewhat similar to our new model.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.759
But that's all it is.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.839
But that's all it is.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.480
When our company produced this sofa,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.600
When our company produced this sofa,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.319
we focused on the overall design concept

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.319
and detail handling.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.680
The design team, guided by the concept of beautiful living,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.240
referenced various cultural elements

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.399
and traditional craftsmanship.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.680
After repeated research and revisions,

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.680
we finally created this product.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.959
Your words are baseless.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.439
You just asked me for evidence.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.800
Well, where is *your* evidence?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.720
Everyone, look.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.600
These are our design sketches.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.160
From the initial concept

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.240
to the final form,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.399
everything is meticulously documented.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.000
Note this timestamp.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.399
Note this timestamp.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.360
The design sketch was completed on March twenty-third.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.120
After revisions and refinements,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.680
the final design was confirmed on May seventeenth.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.959
However, as far as I know,

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.480
Hongmu Group's so-called original product

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.720
first appeared on August second.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.879
first appeared on August second.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.160
This is clearly later than our design timeline.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.160
The above is sufficient to prove

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.079
that our design is original

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.040
and not plagiarized.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:14.959
Well said.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.879
Exactly.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.240
He has no evidence at all.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.680
This is our designer's written statement and public notice.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.639
Sir,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.839
our Qin Group

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.639
had no obligation to prove our innocence today.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.959
But under pressure,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.399
we had no choice but to do so.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.639
Sir,

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:33.920
as far as I know,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.360
you are a distributor for Hongmu Group, correct?

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:37.920
Although I don't know

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.120
what your purpose is,

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.319
after this press conference concludes,

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.160
we will file a lawsuit against you personally

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.319
and Hongmu Group.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.480
We will demand compensation for

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.120
all losses incurred by our company.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.639
It has to be Secretary Lin.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.920
Absolutely.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.720
Thank goodness.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.839
Otherwise, with a crisis like this,

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.040
we really wouldn't know what to do.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.439
Secretary Lin is truly irreplaceable

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.759
in the workplace.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:08.480
Well then,

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.000
what about us?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.199
Hurry up.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.439
Come on.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.720
Hey, Dad.

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:29.759
Meili.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.720
The product launch went really well.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.600
Congratulations.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.839
You watched it too?

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:34.720
Yes.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.319
You handled it very well.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.680
My daughter is amazing.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.600
By the way,

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.160
when are you bringing Secretary Lin home?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.879
I heard from your mom

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.120
that you're together.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:46.319
Dad...

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.879
I have something to do, gotta go.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.240
Hello?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.639
This kid.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.720
It seems Secretary Lin and I

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.800
are still too different.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.199
So,

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.000
Boss Qin,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.120
simply can't do without Secretary Lin.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:04.560
Now you understand, right?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.519
Pre-sale orders alone exceeded twenty million.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.240
Boss, you're truly incredible.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.759
Today,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.480
was also thanks to Secretary Lin.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.800
Am I

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.959
hearing praise again?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.959
What's wrong?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.759
What are you thinking about?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.160
Nothing.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.639
Let's have dinner together tonight.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:35.240
Okay.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.800
But the department has a celebration dinner.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.120
How about

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.839
just the two of us?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.959
Alright.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.959
Do you feel better now?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480
Your father and I

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.879
have something to tell you.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.120
Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.319
I really like this story.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.800
I don't know much about music.

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:24.319
That might be one of my few shortcomings.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.199
Up until now,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.399
there have been quite a few, okay?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.200
Alright.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.960
The story

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.799
is about Princess Odette by Swan Lake,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.039
who is turned into a white swan by a demon.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.200
Prince Siegfried

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.480
falls in love with her at first sight

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.720
and vows to save her.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.919
On the night of choosing a bride,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.320
the demon has his daughter, the Black Swan, impersonate the princess.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.559
The prince eventually sees through the deception

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.279
and battles the demon.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.600
He breaks the spell,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:57.240
restoring Princess Odette to human form.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.799
The two live happily ever after.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:08.519
What's wrong with you?

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:10.679
You've been gloomy all day.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320
About the launch...

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.480
Are you unhappy?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.039
Secretary Lin.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.440
I think

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.159
you should resign.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.480
What?

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.720
I want you to resign.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.559
Why resign?

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.960
Because I don't want to be a bride to be chosen,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.759
nor a princess waiting to be rescued.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.279
I just want to be myself.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.600
What bride and princess?

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:56.799
For so long now,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.360
you've done so much for me.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.440
I admit I really need you.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.600
Just like today,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.200
you are, to me,

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.360
so irreplaceable

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:11.279
and indispensable.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:15.200
But precisely because of that,

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.600
I'm very afraid.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.960
Because I truly cannot

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:25.639
I don't have the courage

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.480
to entrust my entire future

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.559
completely to another person.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.360
Because if, once we...

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.080
We what?

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.200
I need to have a backup plan.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:43.519
So I hope between us,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360
we can just be lovers.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:50.120
Because in my story,

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:51.720
from beginning to end,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.480
there is only one prince.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.200
And that is myself.

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.679
Yourself?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.399
As the only daughter of a family business,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.679
I have almost never

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.919
been trusted by anyone.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm not like you.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.080
You can go home anytime;

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.879
a company awaits your takeover.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.159
But what I have today

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.039
was earned step by step,

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:22.320
under immense family pressure.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.919
So that demands that I

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.639
must always strive to be the best at everything.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:32.120
That's why, all along,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.879
the one I can completely trust and rely on,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.480
other than myself,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.039
is no one else.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.000
Because I'm prepared

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.519
to retreat at any time,

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:50.279
I must prevent all risks.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.120
Is that what you mean?

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:56.080
Didn't you know that from the start?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.000
What are you saying?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.720
Didn't you know from the beginning

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.000
how selfish

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.399
and self-centered I am?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.720
So why ask me like this?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.840
Must my entire future

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.759
be completely controlled by you?

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.960
So you're saying I'm just an option for you.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.759
Yes.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.600
Because in my life,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.919
there has never been an Option B.
