00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.920
Low battery warning. Low battery warning.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.719
Master, please charge immediately.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.480
Otherwise, the system will automatically sleep.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.000
Xiao Cang, how do I charge you?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.920
I don't know.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.120
Master, I cannot sleep.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.560
Once the system shuts down...

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.120
...you will become a fool again.

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:22.280
We must try every possible way to charge.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.280
Searching for charging devices.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.040
Power strip ahead on the left.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:38.959
Come on.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.879
You're so high-tech...

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.079
...can't you have a charging port like a phone?

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.359
Huo Ming.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.000
Huo Ming.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.439
Huo Ming, wake up.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.560
What's wrong with you?

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.000
I...

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.280
What's going on?

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.120
Does Lin Yun need charging too?

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.599
Lin Yun.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000
Master, it's charging.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.080
It feels so good.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.639
Hold her tight. Hold her tight.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.840
Don't let go.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:45.639
Don't let go, keep charging.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.080
Master.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.639
Lin Yun is your power bank.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.680
I know why when you first saw her...

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.080
...those codes flashed up.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.520
Those codes were guiding you to charge from her.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.000
What the hell kind of tech is this?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.840
Get close to her, quick.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.039
Let me charge a bit more.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.000
Master, it's charging.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.080
Get closer.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.439
A little closer.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.800
A little closer.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.879
Closer, closer.

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.439
So fast.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.280
Super fast charge connected.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.199
Let's switch positions.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.319
Maybe it'll be faster.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.280
Not fully charged yet.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.199
One more time.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.759
Pervert

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.639
Pervert

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.600
I... I... I...

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.720
Well, you just fainted.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.199
I put you on the sofa.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.079
If I said I was charging,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.360
would you believe me?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.199
I believe you.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.680
You do?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.319
You have an AI eye.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.759
It needs bioelectricity to function.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.439
Other energy conversion rates are too low.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.759
This is the only way to charge.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.240
How do you know?

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.920
Because this energy supply method...

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.079
was designed by me.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.439
But the problem is,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.959
the way you just acted...

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.600
you didn't seem like a fool.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.600
If I hadn't seen you charging,

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.600
I would have almost been fooled by you.

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.360
Huo Ming.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.639
Isn't it tiring pretending to be stupid?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.240
It's alright.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.839
The first time I went to your company,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.600
you suspected me, didn't you?

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.399
I checked.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.800
The person at Professor Yang's apartment that day...

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:10.879
was you.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.839
Yes, it was me.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.000
Why did you run?

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.439
You wouldn't suspect

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.199
that I'm the Brain Burner, right?

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.279
You were highly suspicious.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.480
Of course I suspected you.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.319
But since you used me to charge,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.639
and you have an AI eye,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm sure you aren't him.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.399
But why pretend to be stupid?

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:31.800
Three years ago,

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.399
the institute was destroyed,

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:35.560
and Cang Qiong went missing.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.480
Those who wanted to steal Cang Qiong back then...

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.720
are still at large.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.120
To protect myself,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.639
I had no other choice.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.000
Besides,

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.879
I didn't know what your intentions were,

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.279
so I played the fool.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.639
My goal...

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.879
is to investigate the truth of what happened,

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.120
and retrieve Cang Qiong.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.680
Then we are the same.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.600
Why don't we team up?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.199
Defeat Du Size,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
find all the researchers,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040
and find Cang Qiong.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.279
Pleasure working with you.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.240
Since we're partners now,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.639
could you stop monitoring me?

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.800
Acting like a dog in front of cameras...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.879
is really tiring.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.319
Mr. Du,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.120
are you here to give me money again?

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.480
You're right, Mr. Bai.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.920
Cooperate with me,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.639
and I guarantee you'll make money.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.839
Why should I trust you?

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.519
Lin Yun needs 200 million to buy back shares.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.680
That's the price after I intentionally inflated it.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.120
Once Yunzhi Tech becomes mine,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.079
you can invest at the original price,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.000
saving at least half the money.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.240
But I already promised Lin Yun.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.000
I should at least wait for her to arrive.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.240
No need to wait.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.720
They can't make it.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.959
You are...

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.879
Let's go.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.839
Mr. Du has suddenly become so humane.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.759
I'm really not used to it.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.600
There are no eternal enemies or friends,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.399
only eternal interests.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.920
If our two companies cooperate,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.680
it's a win-win.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.000
Such a beastly deed...

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.079
only Mr. Du could pull it off.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.000
You were clearly unconscious.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.639
How can you be here?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.000
We have Mr. Du to thank for that,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.720
and the doctor you kindly sent us.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.240
She wants 200 million for the investment.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.040
Once I acquire Yunzhi Tech,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.800
Mr. Bai, you'll only need 100 million

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.600
to get the same equity.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.399
This math...

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.240
Mr. Bai can surely figure it out.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.639
That's right, Ms. Lin.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:23.279
Mr. Du has a point.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.040
I knew Mr. Du would pull this.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.480
Mr. Bai, to show our sincerity,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.360
of the 200 million,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.720
100 million will be for shares,

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:32.200
and 100 million for fixed-income investment,

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.960
which will enjoy double returns.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.320
We won't let Mr. Bai lose out.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.919
All right.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:39.039
Since Ms. Lin is so sincere,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.120
I'll invest the 200 million.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.000
Scientific research isn't a game.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.440
Technical reserves are useless.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.159
We need to see actual results.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.000
We already have the chip sample.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.320
We can go to the company to see it now.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:53.320
Sure.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.600
Let's go take a look right now.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.120
I'd like to see something impressive.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.720
Mr. Bai.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.080
Trust me.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.960
Even if you go,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.080
you won't see anything.

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:03.559
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.080
Move aside.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.039
Sorry, Ms. Lin.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.799
You can't go any further.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:11.559
Move aside.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:12.960
This is my company.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.720
That's not necessarily true.

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:16.440
Ms. Lin.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:17.879
I am very sorry.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.919
Until you buy back the shares,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.080
the board has decided

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.919
that I will temporarily take over the company.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:25.080
Mr. Xiao.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.279
This is Mr. Bai.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.840
As long as he sees the chip sample,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.080
we can sign the contract

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.720
and secure the investment.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.799
The chip sample...

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.279
is the company's most important core technical asset.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.399
How could I possibly let you

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.039
access it so casually?

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.639
Ms. Lin, don't blame me.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.039
Mr. Du's offer was too tempting.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.720
Once Mr. Du acquires the company,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.519
I'll be the CEO.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.399
That's right.

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:47.480
Mr. Xiao is much more suitable

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.320
to run the company than Ms. Lin.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.679
Ms. Lin.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.480
Given the current situation,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.840
I won't be investing.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.399
I will definitely get the chip back.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.080
It's all my fault.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.480
I was too focused on research.

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.039
My control over the company was too weak.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.039
I didn't guard against the traitor.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.679
Have they already got the chip?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.360
No.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:17.279
The real chip sample...

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.200
only I know

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.799
what the serial number is.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.320
190709.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.120
The only way now

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.039
is to find the encrypted badge

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.080
and enter the data room.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.039
I'll figure something out.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.720
You have a new delivery order.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.279
I have to work now.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.080
Hello.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.279
Your delivery has arrived.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.279
Please put it on the table for me.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.759
Excuse me

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.200
My water pipe is broken

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.639
Could you help me fix it?

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.200
The tools are all inside

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.480
I still have orders to deliver

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.440
It's about to time out

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.720
Don't be in such a rush

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:07.039
I can pay you ten times the compensation

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120
Encrypted badge

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.200
This is useful

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.519
Master, something is odd here

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:14.679
It might be a trap

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.480
I must get the badge first

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480
What?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.320
Is that not enough?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.440
Fine, I'll help you fix it

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.840
Mr. Du, he went inside

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.480
Good

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:31.000
You ruin my plans every time

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.720
I need to check if you have

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.840
any tech enhancements

00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:42.399
Master, decryption and copying started

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.639
It will take a little time

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.120
It's not easy to fix

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.600
It needs some time

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:48.480
No rush

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.120
I have time

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:57.919
Start scanning

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:00.000
Sisi, stall him for twenty seconds

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.279
Guide his line of sight

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.480
to look at the camera

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.639
Xiao Cang, hurry up

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:07.679
I'm being scanned

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:08.440
Yes, Master

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.480
I'm speeding up now

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.399
Five

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.399
Four

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.799
Three

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.120
Two

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.639
Master, done

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.320
Scan interrupted

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:26.679
You idiot, just one second short

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.759
Sorry

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:29.000
I can't fix it

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.039
Stall him, quick

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.200
Don't go! Keep fixing it

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:37.440
Nice stockings

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:38.840
Remember to put your clothes on properly

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.120
I still have deliveries to make

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.120
Twenty seconds

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.080
You couldn't even stall him for twenty seconds

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.159
Useless

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:54.320
So it's the eyes

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.360
The nerves in the eyeball are incredibly complex

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.679
Yet they integrated so well

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:00.320
This must be Cang Qiong's technology

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:02.639
Since it is an AI Eye

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:06.399
it must be sensitive to intense nanowave light

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:23.039
Lin Yun said the sample number is 190709

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:25.240
Xiao Cang, initiate search

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.639
Found it

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:36.600
Mr. Du

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240
Huo Ming has taken the bait

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.879
Looks like we can kill two birds with one stone

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.879
Huo Ming

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.240
Didn't expect this, did you?

00:13:58.039 --> 00:13:59.879
The AI Eye's photosensitive elements

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.000
are most vulnerable to intense light

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.279
Don't you really want

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:05.720
the goggles we're wearing?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.759
Sorry

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.159
None for you

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.200
Get him!
