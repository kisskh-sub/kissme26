WEBVTT

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.520
Run!

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.280
Why stop running?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.359
Let me see what your AI Eye looks like.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.200
Photosensitive sensors overloaded by strong light.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.359
Unable to generate images.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.920
Master, shall I overclock?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.000
To improve image resolution.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.239
Do you even need to ask? Overclock now!

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.480
Overclocking consumes a lot of power.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.640
It can only last ten seconds.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.000
Ten seconds is enough.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.760
Hurry!

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.040
Give me the strongest light!

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.359
Master, insufficient power.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.159
Unable to overclock.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.280
Closing all auxiliary functions.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.840
I'll do it myself.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.159
But Master, they'll beat you to death.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.280
I want you to save power.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.120
Xiao Cang.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.799
I don't want you to get locked up.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.719
Get him!

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.359
Under strong light,

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.680
he's just a piece of trash.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.040
Kill him.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.159
Master.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.519
I can activate slow motion to escape.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.439
No.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.719
You will go into hibernation.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.879
Master.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.799
I can hold on.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.280
Who turned off the lights?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
There's no strong light.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.359
President Du.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:03.159
My showtime has arrived.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.200
I can't see anything.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.599
President Du.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.039
Don't you want to take off your goggles?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Thanks for the lesson, President Du.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.199
I'm taking the chip.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.039
Huo Ming.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.360
I let you in on purpose.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.159
Just to use you to find the chip sample.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.199
And then, destroy it.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.520
Warning, warning.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.879
Chip destroyed.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.280
Please evacuate immediately.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.800
The chip is already destroyed.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.080
Without the chip,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.879
Lin Yun won't get the investment.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.719
Yunzhi Technology is mine.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.879
It's me.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.719
Timely light switch, right?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.879
Although I'm not very educated,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.639
I thought,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.319
they're wearing goggles.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.879
It's unfair to fight like that.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.520
It's only fair if everyone can't see.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.759
Golden partners.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.319
I always felt that

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.159
no one dares to resist someone like Du Size.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.120
Even someone like me,

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.159
I can only submit to him.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
Listen to everything he says.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.159
Even knowing he does things that are

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.400
wicked and immoral.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.479
Until I met you.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.159
You dare to resist.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.560
And you made that jerk suffer.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:04.560
I respect you.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.319
I want to follow you.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.599
Master.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.960
Based on micro-expressions,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.159
he is telling the truth.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.960
We're partners from now on.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.079
You're praising me so much I'm embarrassed.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.120
Old Ding.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.399
Low battery warning.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.360
Master, need to charge immediately.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.360
I have something urgent.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.199
I'm leaving first.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.160
Master, I'm sorry.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.879
System is entering hibernation.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.959
Lin Yun.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.319
Lin Yun.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.439
Lin Yun.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.120
Help me.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.560
Master.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.360
Detected heart rate accelerating.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.600
Starting to charge now.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.000
It's charging.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.199
It's just a bit slow.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.720
Master.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.959
Adrenaline soaring.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:25.040
Charging has sped up.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.160
Entering super fast charge.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
Activating overclocked charging.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.439
So all her groundwork earlier

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.000
was to test the charging mode.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.720
It should be fully charged by now.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.360
H-How did you know?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.360
Why...

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.720
did we charge so fast?

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.519
The speed of bioelectric charging

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.199
has nothing to do with voltage.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.519
Theoretically,

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.480
any woman who moves your heart

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240
can stimulate your adrenaline secretion

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.920
to charge it.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.480
But only someone whose soul aligns with yours

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.040
can achieve rapid charging.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.399
You mean...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.079
our souls are aligned?

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.399
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.040
In my eyes,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.439
you're just a test subject.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:59.759
That kiss just now

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.879
didn't mean anything else.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.759
Thank you.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:06.800
By the way,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.680
the chip was destroyed by Du Size.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.399
We'll have to play it by ear tomorrow.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.240
Okay.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.959
You don't have the chip sample,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.199
and you didn't get the investment.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.000
Sorry,

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.000
the company doesn't belong to you anymore.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.480
Lin Yun,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.720
stop struggling.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.800
Drop your high and mighty attitude

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.680
and beg us.

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.160
Actually,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.240
the most exciting part of hunting

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.639
is the prey's final struggle.

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:41.240
Bai Xinhui said she decided not to invest.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.399
Lin Yun,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.839
it's time to let go, isn't it?

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.079
Lin Yun,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.240
why don't you kneel down

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.759
and be my woman?

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.120
That way,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.040
maybe I'll cut you some slack.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.800
Sorry about that.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.839
Sorry about that.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.360
Traffic was bad, I'm late.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.519
Everyone's here.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:25.920
Please continue.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.680
Didn't you say you decided not to transfer the funds?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.079
I said I wouldn't transfer the funds.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.120
But this is my first collaboration with President Lin.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.639
So to show my sincerity,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.960
I came in person.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.480
You dare to invest without seeing the chip sample?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.600
President Du,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.240
you're talking about this, right?

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.200
The chip was destroyed by Du Size.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.879
But what he destroyed was a fake.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.200
Knowing President Du would do this,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.240
luckily, I swapped it out beforehand.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:12.240
From now on, I've officially entered the tech circle.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.480
President Du,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.000
we'll be peers from now on.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:20.480
President Lin,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.399
I can transfer the money once the contract is signed.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:22.759
Good.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.240
But as for certain traitors,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.399
I suggest you make him leave right after getting the money.

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.679
I don't want to see him in the company again.

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.360
President Xiao, you're fired.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.279
Get out, now.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.000
President Du!

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.159
President Du!

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.120
Pleasure doing business.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:47.759
Pleasure doing business.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.879
The company reorganization is complete.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:51.559
Everyone bought off by Du Size

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.519
has been cleared out.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.559
Thank you.

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.080
No need.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.200
What did you find?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
Based on our AI chip's

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.000
search results of the entire server,

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:08.639
the reason The Firmament couldn't be found before

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.919
is because a researcher

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:12.080
dismantled it into many segments

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.639
and placed them in different locations.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.840
This technology is extremely difficult.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.879
If we want to find The Firmament,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.480
we must find this researcher.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080
Any leads?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.000
This person,

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.399
do you recognize her?

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:32.440
It's her.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:34.759
Her name is Li Xue.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.440
After the incident three years ago,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.679
she said goodbye to scientific research.

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.840
Now she's the owner of a gym.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:00.679
The former Dr. Li

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.120
has suddenly transformed

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.639
into a gym owner.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.759
That's quite a leap.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.279
Hello, sir.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.720
We're closed.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080
I'm not here to work out.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:13.639
I need to talk to you.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.840
Li Xue.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:24.519
I'm sorry,

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.919
my name isn't Li Xue.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.320
My name is Fu Xue.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.080
This photo...

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.200
you remember it, right?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.519
The towel is over there.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.399
Pass it to me.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.080
Thanks.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.279
I'm Huo Ming.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.159
My father is Huo Haiyang.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.879
I have something important to discuss with you.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.919
I don't know Huo Haiyang.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.320
That photo of yours...

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.799
Master, dangerous target approaching.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:04.879
It's the Brain-Burner.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.879
Danger.
