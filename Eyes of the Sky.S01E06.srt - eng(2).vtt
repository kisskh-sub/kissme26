WEBVTT

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.560
Master

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.159
Dangerous target approaching detected.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.679
It's Mind-Bender.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.679
Danger.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.439
AI control system detected in the helmet.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.359
So it's an AI helmet.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
His skills...

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.959
Truly Huo Haiyang's son.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.360
Huo Ming.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.199
Lin Yun.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.000
Why are you here?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.360
I...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.080
Mind-Bender.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.879
Mind-Bender is here.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.360
I...

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.639
Too bad he got away.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.960
Why are you here?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960
I came to take out the trash.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.319
And to meet a client.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.080
A client?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560
My client is here. I'm leaving.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.879
I've arrived.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.879
Meeting a client at 10 PM?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.319
Her surprised expression lasted over a second.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.759
Obviously faked on purpose.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.479
Is she covering for Mind-Bender?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.039
My name really is Li Xue.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.319
I am one of the seven researchers.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.240
Are you in charge of dismantling The Firmament?

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.080
I'm mainly responsible for The Firmament's repair and networking.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.759
Can your AI Eye connect to the network?

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.159
Connect to the network?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.840
This nanobot...

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.080
...can help fix the flaw preventing network connection.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.159
Xiao Cang, is it safe?

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.280
Master, I cannot analyze it for now.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.560
We have to take the risk.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.159
AI Eye smart networking function upgraded.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.680
This thing...

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.160
Lin Yun has it too.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.279
She didn't use it on you.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.680
Lin Yun is very complicated.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.240
I've always felt...

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.639
...that Lin Yun is closely connected to Mind-Bender.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.839
Xiao Cang, search for Lin Yun.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.839
Yes, Master.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.639
I found that...

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.920
...Lin Yun has been researching memory extraction technology.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.439
It seems Fu Xue was right.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.120
I have a USB drive here.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.839
All the data I know is inside.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.639
It's just a pity...

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.439
...the key is lost.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.879
Now that your AI Eye is upgraded...

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.360
...you can crack it.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.120
Charging in progress.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.079
I'm also soul-compatible with her.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.439
Not really.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.519
It can also charge a little.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.480
It's just very slow.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.360
It can help out in a pinch.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.120
Cracking the key...

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.720
...consumes a lot of the AI Eye's power.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.480
If you need charging...

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.560
...you can come find me.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.480
I've given you the USB drive.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.439
I have things to do. I'm leaving now.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.720
You went to find Li Xue today.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.319
You gave a lot.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.040
After you stopped playing dumb...

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.879
...you've changed a lot.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.279
We've already clashed head-on.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.639
No need to pretend anymore.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.240
Since that's the case...

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.639
...why don't we speak openly?

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.639
You ask, I answer.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.160
Okay.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.639
For the past three years...

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.480
...you've been looking for the researchers.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.279
But just as you find a researcher...

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.959
...their memories...

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.480
...have already been extracted by Mind-Bender.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.879
Memories extracted...

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.720
Done by Mind-Bender again.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.079
Ever since what happened to Professor Yang...

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.959
...I've suspected there's a mole in the company.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.160
While I was tracking Mind-Bender today...

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.639
...you just happened to appear.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:41.519
Huo Ming.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.720
Is this a coincidence?

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:46.519
No.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.439
I went there today...

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.120
...specifically to find Mind-Bender.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.279
You don't suspect...

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.920
...that I'm covering for Mind-Bender?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:58.759
Lin Yun.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:00.879
You're still keeping things from me.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.360
President Lin

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.560
You're right on time.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.079
Xiao Cang, help me locate Lin Yun.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:32.279
Yes, Master.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.279
Locating now.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.639
Did you bring the item?

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:36.480
Of course.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.480
I am very sincere.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.639
Where is what I want?

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.839
You're not trying to get something for nothing, are you?

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.519
Huo Ming.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.680
You can't go.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.759
Why cover for him?

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.120
It seems what you traded...

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.759
...was Professor Yang's memories.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.279
You covered for Mind-Bender several times...

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480
...for this reason too, right?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.480
Yes.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.480
But I...

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.399
No need to explain.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.000
In my eyes...

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.600
...lies are written all over your face.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.080
I'm taking the USB drive.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.720
Lin Yun went to great lengths...

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.320
...to get Professor Yang's memories.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.919
Inside, there must be hidden...

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:47.320
...information on the next researcher.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.799
Shen Meng.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.840
It's Dr. Shen Meng.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.840
I saw her at the research institute.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.480
It seems...

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.440
...she is also one of the seven researchers.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.039
What was she in charge of?

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.960
I'm not exactly sure.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.879
But according to her resume...

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.399
...she's likely responsible for dismantling The Firmament.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.720
If Shen Meng is the one dismantling The Firmament...

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.320
...then finding her...

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.120
...means we can find The Firmament.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.200
This is Shen Meng's photo.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.639
What I'm worried about is...

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.120
...since we found out...

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:23.919
...Mind-Bender definitely knows too.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.399
Shen Meng is in danger.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:29.120
I must find her before Mind-Bender does.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.120
Dr. Shen Meng is a prodigy.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.840
She's the youngest of all the researchers.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.320
Exceptionally intelligent.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.279
Good at hiding.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.120
Ordinary methods...

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.919
...won't be able to find her.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.039
If we can get the Bai family involved...

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.639
...maybe we can find her.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.600
The Bai family is very powerful.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.559
They have many eyes and ears.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.960
They have informants in every building of every complex.

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.320
You coming here today...

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.279
...probably isn't just to...

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.840
...help me tidy up the office, right?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.159
President Bai.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.039
Of course not.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:08.679
I...

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.080
...should thank you for helping us before.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.720
No need for thanks.

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:15.480
And don't call me President Bai.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.559
Just call me Xiaohui.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:17.639
Xiao...

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.960
To be honest...

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.200
...you coming here today...

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.120
...is it because you missed me?

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.840
No, President Bai.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.159
I told you to call me Xiaohui.

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:32.039
Calling me President Bai is so distant.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.440
Then...

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.080
Xiao... Xiaohui.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.679
I need you to help me find someone.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.360
Find someone, huh?

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:45.879
Then beg me.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:46.679
Beg you?

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:47.960
How should I beg you?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.360
Depends on your performance.

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.000
I really want to find someone.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.919
Don't be like this.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.879
Who is it?

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.320
Is it your...

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:59.279
Don't be like this, Xiaohui.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.639
Listen to me first.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.039
It's her.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.639
The unforgettable first love?

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:15.360
The one that got away?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.240
That's fine then.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.679
Send this to me.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.679
I'll go back and have the butler check immediately.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.440
Ming.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.120
The person you're looking for is a cleaner at a hotel.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.519
Dr. Shen.

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:47.840
Nice disguise.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.799
Young man,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.279
what are you talking about?

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:52.639
Dr. Shen.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.039
Three years ago, the institute was invaded.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:56.759
You and six other researchers...

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:00.960
What is this?

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.480
Don't rub it.

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:08.720
It's a calcified synthetic nano-powder.

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:09.759
Once contact is made,

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:11.399
it will rapidly spread across the entire eyeball.

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:13.120
I know who you are.

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:14.799
Mind-Bender.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:17.480
Dr. Shen.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.039
Do I look like Mind-Bender to you?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.440
You might be able to fool others,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.759
but you think you can fool me?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.559
Don't bother trying.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:26.480
No human can escape it.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.600
That's right.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.720
No human can escape it.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.440
But my eyes

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:35.720
are not human eyes.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:37.519
Dr. Shen.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:38.639
My name is Huo Ming.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.840
My father was your mentor, Huo Haiyang.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.320
Impossible.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.440
Professor Huo's son died long ago.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:50.759
When the institute was invaded,

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.879
I was only injured.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.360
My father replaced my eyes

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.679
with the AI Eye.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.480
So,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.039
the AI Eye

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:05.360
really can merge perfectly with human nerves.

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:07.320
Dr. Shen.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.519
Two birds with one stone.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.120
This trip was worth it.
