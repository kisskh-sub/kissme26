WEBVTT

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.240
Master, you've been hacked by unknown code.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.399
Your body is unable to move.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.280
Capture Huo Ming for me.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.680
And bring Dr. Shen back with care.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480
Huo Ming, I really have to thank you.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.840
By analyzing your AI Eye,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.159
the AI Glasses that stalled me for two years

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.439
have finally been successfully developed.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.840
They can even reverse-control your AI Eye.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.480
You brat.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.799
Let's see where you run now.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.120
System receiving strong electrical stimulation.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.560
Releasing control.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.439
With these AI Glasses,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.400
you're just a lamb to the slaughter.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.920
A complete waste of space.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.519
Move, then!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.519
Aren't you tough? Get up!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.159
Get him! Beat him hard!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.599
Xiao Cang.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.319
Help me track them.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.520
Where have they taken Dr. Shen?

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.719
Master, battery too low. Unable to track.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.199
Fine. Charge first.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.719
This set of movements

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.159
is also one of the research results from back then.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.120
Created by combining Five Animal Frolics and Yoga.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.039
It can boost adrenaline secretion

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.280
and also charge your AI Eye.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.639
Your heart rate has reached 160.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.680
System charging.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.599
As long as it helps you break free from Lin Yun's grip,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.159
a little sacrifice from me is nothing.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.080
President Lin, we found Huo Ming.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.479
He's at Xiao Xue Gym.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.319
Good.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.000
How is it? Any reaction?

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.560
Is... is that something I can say?

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.080
I'm talking about the battery level.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.199
Master.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.000
You slow-charged with her for 30 minutes.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.439
Battery level increased by 6%.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.479
It... it works.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.840
But it's very slow.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.600
Did Lin Yun tamper with something?

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.800
Why is she the only one who can fast charge?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.959
It seems

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.360
we'll have to charge a bit longer.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560
Come on, let's do the next move.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.680
I think you should stretch this part.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.160
That feels good.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.759
I'll go get some drinks.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.959
You saw it, too.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.040
As for charging in the future,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.199
I won't need to trouble you anymore.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.439
Sometimes what you see isn't necessarily the truth.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.600
I only believe my own eyes.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.759
I traded with Mind-Bender just to catch him.

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:54.560
I didn't expect him to see through it.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:55.600
No matter what,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600
our goals are the same.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.240
Got it.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.720
Huo Ming.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.800
I've upgraded you to Diamond VIP.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.000
Come see me often from now on.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.879
Really?

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.040
You're so good to me.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.000
I'm afraid I might just give myself to you.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.040
Master.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.720
We must find Lin Yun to charge.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.959
Otherwise, for the upcoming operation...

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:26.680
Shut up.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.000
That kid Huo Ming actually messaged me.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.240
He says he'll rescue her in five minutes.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Rest assured, President Du.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.319
We've set up a laser array.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.000
The laser power reaches 600,000 hertz.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.040
It can instantly vaporize any matter.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:51.839
Full-range grid scanning.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.800
Even if Huo Ming grew wings, he couldn't get in.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.040
Tell everyone to stay on high alert.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.600
I'd like to see what tricks this kid has.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.160
Yes, sir.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:15.279
I'm taking her.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.079
Farewell.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.279
Quick! Quick! Go check!

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.839
Yes!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.680
Come back! Protect me!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.360
Stand here.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:25.680
Protect the boss!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.920
She's still here.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.920
Darn it.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.959
I really have to thank you.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.639
For leading me to where Dr. Shen is being held.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.240
So what if you found it?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.000
Saving her won't be that easy.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.480
Master, we need to move fast.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.199
We're about to enter low power mode.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.800
Huo Ming

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.879
Dr. Shen, come with me.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.639
Huo Ming

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.240
Shen Meng is mine.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.279
Do you have enough power without Lin Yun?

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.600
Master, battery level below 1%.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.799
Need to charge immediately.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.000
Huo Ming, you've fallen into my trap.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.080
I gave Professor Yang's memories to Lin Yun on purpose.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.080
Just so you would help me find Shen Meng.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.399
And to drive a wedge between you two.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.480
Running out of power, aren't you?

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.440
You can't beat me.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.639
Master, power is about to run out.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.679
I am about to go into hibernation.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.639
Super fast charging in progress.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Go to hell!

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.120
You've been tricked.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.159
Impossible.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.399
That day you called Lin Yun...

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.399
...to make her appear where I was chasing you.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.039
Huo Ming

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.720
To make me misunderstand that Lin Yun was covering for you.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.279
Lin Yun showed me her recorder.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:32.240
I trusted her long ago.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.000
Then we played along.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:39.559
I made a deal with Mind-Bender...

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.200
...and we argued...

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.960
...just to make you think...

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960
...that I didn't have enough power without Lin Yun.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.480
Only then would you show yourself.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.360
Stop chasing, you're out of power.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.080
Are you okay?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:00.759
Me?

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.159
What could happen to me?

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:03.759
I'm so awesome.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.240
I'll definitely catch him next time.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.279
Just now, I...

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.440
I knocked him to the ground in one hit.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.480
You saw it too.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.399
Really. You don't believe me? I...

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:16.799
You're doing all the talking.

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.240
Really.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.000
If he hadn't run, I would've caught him for sure.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.600
You're bragging.
