00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.640
Dr. Shen

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.399
Dr. Shen

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.359
Here

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.120
I just hit my head and passed out

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.239
Why does my whole body hurt?

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:12.920
Dr. Shen, just stay here and rest easy

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.400
I'll have someone take care of your daily needs

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.560
No one will be able to find you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.359
Once we catch Mind-Bender

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.439
you'll be safe

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:19.439
Thank you

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.319
Professor Huo and Professor Lin were my mentors

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.280
I also want to find out... three years ago...

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.840
who exactly killed them

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.599
Dr. Shen

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.560
Do you know who dismantled The Firmament back then?

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.280
I don't know who dismantled it

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.959
But I know where The Firmament was hidden

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.840
Where?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.159
To hide a grain of sand

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.159
you must place it in the desert

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.480
To hide a drop of water

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.000
you must place it in the ocean

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
To hide data

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.920
you must place it in a flood of data

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.120
Some things seem far away but are right before your eyes

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:51.560
Could it be...

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.200
The Firmament is hidden in Cloud Intelligence Tech's servers?

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.599
That's right

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.640
It's hidden right in the servers

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.640
Then how do we find it?

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.400
I'm not exactly sure how to find it

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.159
But I can give you a signature

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.560
The needle-in-a-haystack work

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.759
will be up to you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.280
I checked all the hard drives

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.599
I can't find it at all

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.680
Is Dr. Shen lying to us?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.520
Or did she remember wrong?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.759
Master, battery low

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.319
Let's fully charge before working

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.080
What's wrong with you?

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.159
Huo Ming, you need to charge

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.719
You... you guys...

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.599
What are you two doing?

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.439
Xiao Hui

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
I'm telling you, we were charging

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.240
Do you believe that?

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.960
Charging?

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.800
Charging

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.159
Then can I charge too?

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.000
Wait a minute

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.960
You call President Bai "Xiao Hui"?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.839
Yeah, my Dad calls me Xiao Hui

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.800
And he can call me Xiao Hui too

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.639
Right, mainly because her Dad calls her Xiao Hui

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.720
So calling her Xiao Hui is just a form of address

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:27.639
Xiao Cang

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.560
Hurry and accept a takeout order for me

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.879
Received, Master

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.600
Order incoming, order incoming

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.240
I have to go deliver it, quick

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:37.480
Stop

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.959
I'll go with you

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.680
That's not a good idea

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.639
Where's my takeout?

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.199
It's overdue, you know?

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.160
Sorry, customer

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.079
Traffic jam, arriving soon

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.800
Traffic on an e-bike?

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:55.839
Who are you kidding?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.480
Don't give me that crap

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.600
If you don't come soon, I'll give you a bad review

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:00.399
Traffic on an e-bike...

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:01.680
Who is that idiot trying to fool?

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.839
I'll help you deliver. I'll help you deliver.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:24.360
Is it Mr. Li?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.160
I'll help you deliver.

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.519
Excuse me, your delivery.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.759
So sorry.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.399
There really was a traffic jam just now.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.040
Hope you won't give him a bad review.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.399
There's one more order.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.759
Bai Wansan.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:40.879
That name is so imposing.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.639
That's my dad. I ordered the takeout.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.759
Let's go, deliver to my dad.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.000
President Bai.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.319
I have a meeting in a bit.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.279
We're not going the same way.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.800
Not the same way.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.839
I have a car too.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.639
Butler.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.480
Let's go. We're going home to deliver.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.399
I... I'm about to be late, Lin Yun.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.560
Let's go.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.839
Huo Ming.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:03.399
It's late. Hurry up.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.600
You...

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
I'm going to be late.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.360
Lin Yun, listen to me.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.399
If it's late, I'll give you a bad review.

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.120
You're something else.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.920
Are delivery guys this well-equipped now?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.360
Are you guys still hiring?

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.160
I can do it.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.040
I can too.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.000
I'm up for it.

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.240
I'll do it for free.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.000
I can go.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.519
Huo Ming, it's your first time meeting my dad.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.639
Just relax and it'll be fine.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.800
Dad, watch me.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.000
Dad!

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.399
Dad!

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:44.720
What happened to my dad?

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.319
Why isn't he being taken to the hospital?

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.680
The old master is in this state because the pacemaker

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.480
malfunctioned,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.399
causing the coma.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.879
He cannot be moved right now.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.399
How could it malfunction?

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.319
My dad uses the best smart pacemaker.

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:58.079
This has never happened before.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.360
But this time we switched to a new model.

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.839
It uses a chip from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.079
I suspect the chip is the problem.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:05.720
Impossible.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.160
Cloud Intelligence Tech's chips

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.639
haven't been applied to medical devices yet.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.240
It is indeed a Cloud Intelligence Tech chip.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.600
It hasn't undergone enough clinical verification,

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.000
yet they dared to use it in a medical device.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.759
This Cloud Intelligence Tech

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.079
doesn't care about human life at all.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.759
Xiao Cang, did you find anything?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.759
Scan complete.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.759
Master, the chip is indeed from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.160
But it has been tampered with.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.519
Bai Xinhui's old man has heart disease.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.319
He recently switched to an AI-powered

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.600
pacemaker.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.360
He was using another company's,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.680
but I asked a friend for help

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.879
to switch to a chip from Lin Yun's company.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:43.759
But her dad is alive and kicking right now.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.079
Isn't that just free advertising for Cloud Intelligence Tech?

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.639
But if the major shareholder's dad

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.279
used a chip from his own company

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:54.759
and died suddenly from an accident instead,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.759
tell me,

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:58.959
who would dare use Cloud Intelligence Tech's chips?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.000
To save him, a precise surgery is required

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.439
to restart the pacemaker.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.879
Why not operate immediately?

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.120
Operate?

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.759
How can I operate without medical equipment?

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.199
You are the family doctor.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.680
You need to think of something, fast!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
The equipment will arrive in half an hour.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.920
But looking at the old master's current state,

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.720
I estimate he can only last a few minutes.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.600
Dad!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.519
Wake up, Dad!

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.079
How is Old Master Bai doing?

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:23.920
It's critical.

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.839
His heart has stopped; he could die at any moment.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.000
If surgery isn't possible,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.560
the pacemaker must be repaired.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.639
Assessing repair success rate.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.960
In this state, the success rate for anyone else is zero.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.639
Even with my assistance,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.120
the repair success rate

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.919
is only 32.7%.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.919
If we don't do it,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.279
the mortality rate is 100%.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:49.159
A one-in-three success rate.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.240
It's worth a shot.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:51.639
You assist me.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.320
I'll give it a try.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:56.360
Wait a minute.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.440
Whatever you're planning to do on your own,

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:01.639
sign the liability waiver.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:04.200
If anything happens, it has nothing to do with me.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.399
Master,

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.159
this Dr. Zhao is acting strange.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.559
I suspect this is another trap set for you.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.159
Saving him is the priority.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.279
Xiao Hui,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.240
even if a top expert were here,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.600
they couldn't possibly do it.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.840
Especially since he's a nobody.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.919
Let him try.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:54.360
Young Mistress, he's just a delivery guy.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.480
In this situation,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.360
people worldwide who can restart a pacemaker

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360
number no more than three.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:09:59.639
How can you entrust President Bai's life

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:00.679
to a piece of trash?

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.799
I said let him try!

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.120
Do you have a solution?

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:06.600
Xiao Cang.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.600
Activate X-ray Vision Mode and Microscope mode.

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.919
Yes, Master.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.039
Activated.

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.279
Initiate Super Stability Assist.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.799
Stabilizing hand nerves.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.399
Remotely disable the pacemaker.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.000
Understood.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.320
Great.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.919
There was a glimmer of hope.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:42.000
Now he's beyond saving.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.200
You're the murderer who killed President Bai.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.440
Didn't you say you could save my dad?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.799
Dad!

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.399
Dad!

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.879
Go.

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.679
Contact the media and release the news.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:02.120
Say Cloud Intelligence Tech's chip and a shareholder

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.919
conspired to kill Old Master Bai.
