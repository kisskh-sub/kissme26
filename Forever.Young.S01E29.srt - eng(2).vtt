WEBVTT

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.840
Feifei.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.560
Remember this.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.319
In the future,

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.519
you'll encounter all sorts of things.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.079
No matter what,

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.599
you must stay brave.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:47.599
Understand?

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:48.599
Okay.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.719
And what about you?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.519
Will you be brave too?

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.799
Oh, right.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.120
There's someone right now

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.520
you need to go see immediately.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.319
Nah, forget it.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.120
What do you mean "forget it"?

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.560
Go on! Come on.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.000
Go right now.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.520
Right now.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.759
Alright.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.840
Be brave!

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.639
Feifei.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.639
What's up? Sneaking around.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.439
Are you looking for me or not?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.000
I...

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.400
You, you, you, you...

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.840
What's wrong?

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.879
It's not that.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.719
You know about me and Uncle Ma, right?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.960
You and Uncle Ma didn't have a falling out, right?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.280
No.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.759
We're good.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840
He and I,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.360
we can talk about anything.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.400
That's good then.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.560
So...

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.039
This matter is...

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280
behind us.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.280
Behind us.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.759
Maybe I still need some time.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.199
But it's fine, it's my own issue.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.719
I just hope

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.560
we can get along like before.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.840
Sis.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.000
You don't need to feel pressured.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.840
Or avoid me.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840
Or be shy.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.000
You little rascal, turning the tables on me!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.639
You're the one who's been avoiding me!

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.560
Alright, don't be sad.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.000
Heartbreak

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is a required course for growing up.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.159
You'll get used to it.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.759
Sis, right now the whole Baofang Hutong,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.280
even Auntie Zhao is comforting me.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.319
I really don't need one more person.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.080
Fine.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.840
I was just afraid

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.120
of losing a little brother like you.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm late, Sis.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.039
Sis, I really have to go.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.800
Otherwise you really will lose me.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.360
Go on.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.400
Pay attention in class.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.840
Bye.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.399
Bye.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.120
So where exactly is this place?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.079
Don't ask so many questions.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.040
I've got it all arranged.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.360
Just follow me.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.839
Always so mysterious and secretive.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.319
Chunsheng, not bad!

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.839
A Harley Street Glide.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.160
Chrome luggage rack.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.079
Fairing.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.959
Upgraded suspension.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.519
This bike is sweet.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.360
Wow, you know your stuff.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.519
That's about the extent of my knowledge.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:53.800
Talking like a real expert.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.199
Big bro.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:54.720
Really nice!

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.519
Uncle Wang.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.360
Whose bike is this?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.319
Mine.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:58.759
What about the old one?

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.800
Why'd you get a new one?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.839
The old one's ancient, I'm keeping it as a collectible.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.120
This one's brand new.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.720
I plan to take your auntie out on a trip.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.120
Then, then what about Feifei?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.319
Feifei's about to

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.519
start college soon, right?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.079
We need to get used to being a couple again.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.160
So Feifei's on his own.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.800
And the restaurant...

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800
The restaurant is your responsibility too.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.360
Alright then.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.800
Wife, let's go!

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.560
Stop rushing me!

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.800
I need to sort things out at the restaurant first.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.600
Auntie.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.839
Sis, you look twenty years younger!

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.079
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:29.160
More like ten years or so.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.160
Auntie, if you dressed like this every day,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.319
Uncle Wang would be totally smitten.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.560
Would your Uncle Wang dare look at anyone else now?

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.600
Let's go, beautiful.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.600
So sweet.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.800
Let's go.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.519
Wow, this gear is really something.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.160
We're off!

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.399
Be safe!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.279
Have fun!

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.160
Old Wang, shirking his duties.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.800
Off to be romantic.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.519
Watch your leg swinging on!

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.120
Be careful, Auntie!

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.839
Have your fun, but be safe, okay?

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.120
Take a picture!

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.800
Safe travels!

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.319
Go!

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:00.959
We're leaving!

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.639
Fun, riding a motorcycle like this.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.519
What a gas guzzler.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.519
It's quite spacious.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.439
This place is really nice.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.160
But it must be expensive, right?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.480
I can't afford it.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920
Actually,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.720
Actually... Stop with the "actually"!

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.360
I told you, I have principles.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.879
I have to handle everything for this photo exhibition myself.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.560
Actually, it's not as expensive as you think.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:20.879
You can afford it.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.560
The owner here,

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.319
also grew up in Beijing.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.160
He lives abroad now.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.639
When he heard

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.920
you wanted to hold an exhibition about Beijing's ecology,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.959
he got really excited.

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:33.519
So he gave us a discount.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.199
Really?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.360
You must have blackmailed him or something.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.920
Honestly, Xiaoqi arranged it.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.519
Really.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.319
The day he came to see me,

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.399
he had already made the arrangements.

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.079
He told me not to tell you.

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.160
And insisted on taking the credit for it.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.399
That little punk is actually not so bad.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.519
I got something for you.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.839
What is it?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.319
Well?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.799
You remembered?

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:34.879
I remember.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.120
Come in.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.279
Hello.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:10.879
Hello.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:12.919
Alright, have a seat.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.720
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.120
Tong Qiu, right?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.240
I heard you were fired.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.120
And for inappropriate conduct with the opposite sex.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:28.840
Mr. Tong,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.480
your background check did not pass.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.360
Very regrettable.

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:33.480
Sorry. We look forward to future cooperation.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.120
Thank you.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.159
Goodbye.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:38.639
Brother Ming.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.879
Xiao Tong.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.080
You're here to... to hire people.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:51.159
Interviewing?

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:54.360
You... your side...

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.639
had some issues.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.799
I can... can understand. This, this...

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:03.399
It's tough to achieve good performance these days.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:09.360
If the heart is there, the dream is there.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.960
At worst, you just start over.

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:17.519
Going to the restroom.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:18.320
Well...

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.440
You go ahead then.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.159
I'm not in a hurry.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240
Then I'll go first.

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.519
So awkward.

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.559
A terrifying coincidence.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.360
Hello?

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:21.720
Lian Bao.

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:24.159
Have you signed Yuanyuan's immigration consent form?

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:28.279
I was just about to. What's up?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.559
Don't sign it yet.

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:51.320
Make a big scene, then quietly leave.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.720
Easier said than done.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.679
Too much reluctance and concern.

00:13:58.039 --> 00:13:59.759
Prevent me from leaving quietly.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.919
Let alone actually leaving.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.480
Since things can't be spoken plainly,

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.840
leaving some hope is better for everyone.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960
All I can do

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.480
is try to settle everything properly.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.879
And then...

00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:16.480
quietly await that day's arrival.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.440
Mom, Dad, I'll hang up now.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840
Okay, okay, okay.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:09.480
Alright.

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:11.720
Bye, bye, bye.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.039
You're useless too.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.840
Can't even compete with those young kids at work.

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.399
Who pays the mortgage?

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:20.600
A grown man,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.120
doesn't know to focus on his career.

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.440
Our company

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:28.240
has a transfer opportunity.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.440
To Xi'an.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.759
Salary increases by fifty percent.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.440
Not coming back for a year?

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.320
That... wouldn't work.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.799
But this time is different.

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:38.799
It's not just a salary increase.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.080
There's a chance to become a director.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.840
Right now, the competition for the director position

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:51.639
is extremely fierce.

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:54.320
And headquarters' idea is that

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:57.240
if I stay in Xi'an for another year,

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:58.879
it's more secure.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:00.039
Stay another year?

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:05.519
Your key performance indicators for the past six months

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.600
haven't been properly met.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.600
Daily reports, monthly, quarterly, annual reports...

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.720
Look at the garbage you wrote yourself.

00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:12.799
Don't be angry.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.320
Yes, it's my problem.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.799
It really is my problem.

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:19.679
Honey.

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:22.600
This promotion probably isn't happening this time.

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:25.480
And the next promotion probably won't happen either.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:26.720
I'm sorry.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.320
What a mess.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.679
Why do you think everything is so simple?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.200
This matter of yours is unclear.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.600
Would another bank dare hire you?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.799
Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.480
Don't... don't get worked up.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.440
Besides,

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.919
those two clients of yours,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.639
did you get them through your own ability?

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:18.559
Don't you think it's strange?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.079
Before, Yuanyuan said she didn't want to immigrate.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.839
Now she suddenly changed her mind.

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:25.640
Kids...

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.680
Maybe Yuanyuan just feels sorry for her old dad,

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.279
trying to cheer me up for a bit.

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:32.000
The way you are as a father...

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.079
You have so little faith

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:34.599
in Yuanyuan's feelings for you.

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.039
What do you mean?

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:38.279
Yuanyuan actually didn't tell you the truth at all.

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.559
You know how it is,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.119
kids can't keep secrets.

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.319
She told Xuanxuan about it.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.079
Xuanxuan told me.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.599
She said she doesn't want to go abroad at all.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.839
Hu Nana told her to say that to you.

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:04.880
Jenny

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.039
Do you love Daddy?

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:07.839
Yes.

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.039
Daddy is in trouble now.

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.480
Do you want to help him?

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.039
Yes.

00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:18.079
You know what, Jenny?

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:21.480
Uncle Kevin is Daddy's investor.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:23.359
If it weren't for Uncle Kevin,

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:25.000
Daddy wouldn't have a job.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.119
But now,

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:28.519
Uncle Kevin wants you and Mommy

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:30.279
to move abroad together.

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:32.359
If you don't want to go,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.279
Uncle Kevin will be unhappy.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.240
And if Uncle Kevin is unhappy,

00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:37.640
Daddy will lose his job.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.519
What should I do then?

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:41.599
I don't want Daddy to be sad.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.319
So,

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:45.839
you need to tell Daddy

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:49.200
that you want to move abroad with Mommy.

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:52.799
And also,

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:54.839
you must tell Daddy

00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:56.640
that it's your own idea.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.880
If Daddy finds out the truth,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.960
he'll be very, very upset.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.119
Understand?

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.000
I understand.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.839
Come on, pinky swear with Mommy.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:09.759
Pinky swear, a solemn vow,

00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:11.559
for a hundred years, no changing.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.440
Seal it.

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.599
What if you break it?

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:14.240
A puppy.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.039
A puppy, you'd be a puppy.

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:17.279
You'd be a big dog.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.720
What a jerk!

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.680
She's lying to Yuanyuan.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.920
And using me to threaten Yuanyuan.

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:23.960
How could she do such a thing?

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.599
I think you need to...

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.359
I'm going to confront her.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.960
Lianbao, don't be impulsive.

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:31.640
Li Lianbao!

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.759
Hu!

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:39.799
When we divorced,

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:41.279
you wanted custody of Yuanyuan.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:42.920
I thought since she was young,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.759
being with her mother might be better.

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:45.920
So I didn't fight you for it.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.279
All these years,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.480
you've been badmouthing me to Yuanyuan.

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:50.759
Saying our marriage fell apart

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:52.000
because I neglected the family.

00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:53.119
I put up with that too.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.759
Now you're lying to Yuanyuan again.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.440
Is this how a mother should act?

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.599
Just give up on this idea.

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:04.799
I will absolutely not agree

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.240
to Yuanyuan emigrating with you.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.440
If you keep playing

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.759
your dirty tricks behind my back,

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:10.359
we'll have a nice chat in court

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:11.359
about custody.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.039
Li Lianbao,

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:15.039
I'm doing this for the child's own good.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.480
Cut the crap with me.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.519
If you dare lie to Yuanyuan again,

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:18.519
you'll have me to deal with.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:21.119
Is Lao Kai involved in this too?

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:21.839
Where is he?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.680
Wait for me a second.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.519
Sis! Sis!

00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:26.279
Director Gao!

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:27.960
Your bathroom...

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.039
Gao Feng!

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.519
Brother Bao!

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:33.920
Brother Bao!

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.480
What took you so long?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.519
Quick, come in and have a drink with us.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:39.920
What are you doing here?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.799
We're celebrating our success here.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.000
Drinking!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.960
Come on, come on!

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.759
Director Gao, let me show you.

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.240
Sis, it's fine, wait a moment.

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:48.000
Director Gao!

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.759
No, you explain first.

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:50.920
What's going on here?

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:53.720
Brother Bao, I really have to thank you.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.240
Thank you for transferring your shares to Kevin.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240
That's what allowed

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.359
Honeycomb Tech to break through successfully.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.759
I promise,

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.359
when it's time for the IPO,

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:04.799
we'll definitely invite you

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.039
to ring the bell together with us.

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:10.119
IPO?

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:11.480
Yes, an IPO!

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.519
Once we're listed,

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:15.039
our hardships will finally pay off.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.119
It's just a bit regrettable

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.839
that you didn't hold on till the end.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.440
But it's okay!

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.599
Selling those shares

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:23.039
earned you a pretty penny, right?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.519
Now we're all free!

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:29.000
Financially free!

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.440
See? That's what I was saying.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.480
Financially free!

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.039
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:34.319
Don't hold it in, you'll hurt yourself.

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:35.720
Right, right. Brother Bao, Brother Bao,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.440
let's go, let's go.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:36.920
Wait for me.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.519
Nana, take care of him, quick.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.519
Let's talk outside.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.799
Talk. What's going on?

00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:00.680
It's really nothing.

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.400
I simply

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.880
helped Honeycomb Tech with a tech pivot,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.960
integrating it into my other investment areas.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.759
The feedback has actually been excellent.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.160
Better than I ever expected.

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:17.240
An IPO is indeed on the agenda now.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.920
No big issues.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.400
Tom.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.119
Let me share something else with you.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.960
The shares you transferred to me

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.279
will soon be worth a hundred million.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.480
No, probably more than a hundred million.

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:34.200
You've been scheming against me from the start.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.039
In business, that's not called scheming.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.079
It's strategy.

00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:40.440
I told you,

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.000
the things I want,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.079
others will hand to me willingly.

00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:46.559
Right?

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.079
Honeycomb Tech

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:50.960
has nothing to do with you anymore.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.079
At most, you're just a...

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.599
predecessor.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.119
Come on, want to join us for a drink?

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.119
Tom.

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:17.359
Sorry, Manager Li.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:19.319
I'm just executing the layoff list

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:20.400
set by Kevin.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.160
Please cooperate.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.519
Complete the procedures as soon as possible.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.440
Haven't you always wanted

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.160
shares in Hive Tech?

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.119
Sure.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.000
Name your price.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.519
The price is negotiable.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.240
But I have one condition.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.200
You must invest in Penglexuan.

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:49.079
Jenny,

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:51.240
tell your dad yourself.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.079
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.880
I thought about it again,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.599
and Mom and Uncle Kevin are right.

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:01.319
Lao Kai,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.119
was moving abroad your idea?

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.559
Tom, calm down.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.119
We really just wanted

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:09.559
a better life for Jenny.

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.200
Lao Zhang,

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.440
Lao Ma, I've figured it out.

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.279
This Kevin guy is really something.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.000
He completely severed

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.160
Hive Tech's

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.279
home entertainment division.

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:50.759
He pivoted entirely to smart agriculture.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.200
And what's more,

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:53.279
he used

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.480
two of Hive Tech's original

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.880
patents for entertainment photography,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.799
for dynamic tracking and capture,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.200
to develop a whole new

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.240
pest and disease control system.

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:07.240
His earlier investments in Southeast Asia

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.680
and that new agri-tech company in Central Europe

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:11.440
were all to set up this play in advance?

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:13.759
Exactly.

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:16.000
Hive Tech's patents

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.240
can seamlessly integrate with those companies.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:20.519
The entire upstream and downstream supply chain

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.759
has already been connected.

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.440
And from what I know,

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:25.519
he's already signed cooperation agreements

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:27.240
with certain countries' agriculture ministries.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.640
Alright, I got it.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.759
Send me the detailed information.

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:33.119
I'll contact you later.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.559
Okay.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:12.319
So, how's it going?

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.240
Not bad.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.759
Nice, looks pretty professional.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.599
What are you doing with that?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.039
I still want

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.880
to make the photo frames by hand.

00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:36.279
But I'd like you to help me design them.

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.200
What do you have in mind?

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:44.960
I want all the frames

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.079
to be different sizes.

00:26:46.079 --> 00:26:48.200
But I think this area is really good.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.559
It faces the sunlight perfectly.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.519
I'd like to put some

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:52.559
larger photos here,

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.640
to highlight the theme.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.440
What do you think?

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:55.559
Sounds good.

00:26:57.359 --> 00:26:58.839
Since you're working so hard,

00:26:58.839 --> 00:26:59.960
here's a gift for you.

00:27:01.039 --> 00:27:02.519
Getting a gift before I even start?

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:05.039
Here.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:06.720
These...

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.880
Aren't these the ones from the market last time?

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.960
I bought them back then just for a photoshoot.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.759
Now that the shoot's done,

00:27:12.759 --> 00:27:13.640
I can give them to you.

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:15.759
Thanks.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.440
Try them on.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:18.960
Now?

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.559
Yeah.

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.559
You have to wear these shoes.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.200
They go perfectly with your outfit.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.599
Come on, try them!

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:25.279
Try them on!

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:36.039
Comfortable?

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.240
How are they?

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:41.160
Alright.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.039
Do they fit?

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:42.880
They fit pretty well.

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.400
What a coincidence, I just bought them and they're your size.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:48.720
Thanks, they're quite comfortable.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.799
Stay like that.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.359
Sit down, let me take a picture.

00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:52.039
No need.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:53.039
Picture. Sit.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.240
Really, no.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.079
Hold this.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.079
Isn't this silly?

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:58.079
It's supposed to be silly.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.119
Now hold this one too.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.480
Here.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.079
Look at me.

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:05.079
Fine.

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:05.880
Look at me.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.640
One, two...

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:11.440
You're being a bit...

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.160
You're being a bit too goofy.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.079
One, two, three!

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:23.960
Now a proper one.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.839
One, two, three!

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.640
Hello?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.319
Tongtong?

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.480
I saw the photo you sent me.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.039
It looks really nice.

00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:34.799
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.960
What's wrong with you?

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:39.839
You sound a bit off.

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.920
What about you, why aren't you asleep?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.480
I'd like to ask you

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.279
for a favor.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.839
I don't know if you'd be willing.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640
Of course I'm willing.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.720
Just say it.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.759
I'd like to ask you

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.319
to help me document

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:06.559
the time I have left.

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:08.079
Is that okay?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.880
If you don't want to, it's fine.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.799
No pressure.

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:18.480
I'll do it.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.640
That's great.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.079
Well then...

00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:27.480
If there's nothing else, you should rest early.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480
Good night.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.680
Good night.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.720
I want to buy back all your shares in Penglexuan.

00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:19.400
To force me out.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.319
That's right.

00:32:20.599 --> 00:32:22.039
I don't want to work with you anymore.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.400
You're so underhanded.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.519
Tom.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.920
Do you know why

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.720
I invested in Penglexuan with my personal company?

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:33.240
It's because from the very start,

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.920
I never had faith in you.

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.599
You think

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.920
just because you spent a few years at a platform,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.359
you can start a business?

00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:44.160
In reality,

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:47.720
you have neither the vision to understand the market

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.880
nor the ability to execute and strategize.

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:52.720
Take Honeycomb Tech, for example.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.599
How many years did you have it?

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:55.880
Did you make any money?

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.720
When I bought it at five times the price,

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.200
you were perfectly happy.

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:05.640
But when I used my own ability

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:07.920
to multiply its value dozens of times,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.720
you couldn't accept it.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.759
Your understanding

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.240
and ambition only go this far.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.559
That's right.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.599
My investment in Penglexuan

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:19.200
was solely

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.440
to get shares in Honeycomb Tech.

00:33:21.839 --> 00:33:23.960
As for the Penglexuan investment,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.640
I could let it go down the drain. I don't care.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.920
That was always the plan.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.599
But I didn't expect you to get lucky.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.359
Martin was still willing to help you.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.599
Too bad

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:37.599
he won't be around much longer either.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.880
He'll outlive you.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.920
Without Martin,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.920
just you and that cook,

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:46.440
sorry,

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:48.720
at the time, I had no hope

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.119
for Penglexuan's development.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.720
Cut the crap.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.000
Are you selling out or not?

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:54.640
Yes, of course I'm selling.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.160
My goal has been achieved.

00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:57.880
And this project is too risky.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.720
Why wouldn't I sell?

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.039
Then hurry up.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.759
According to the original agreement,

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.039
how the buyback happens

00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:05.640
is up to me.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.720
Name your price.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.440
For Jenny's sake,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.760
and considering our relationship,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.880
I won't ask for much.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:16.880
A flat price: thirty million.

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:17.960
Are you insane?

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.039
Thirty million?

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.800
Is he out of his mind?

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.800
He only invested ten million total with us!

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.239
That's a twenty million profit in and out!

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.360
He's robbing us!

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.800
That's exactly what he's doing now!

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:42.480
Forget that we don't even have thirty million right now,

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.440
even if we did, we wouldn't give it to that bastard!

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.360
No matter what,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.639
I must get him out.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.880
Wait, Lianbao.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.320
Don't get so worked up yet.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.199
Weiguo,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.119
other than forcing him out,

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.239
do we have any other options?

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:59.800
According to the agreement,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.360
if we want to force him out,

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:03.400
right now we can only agree to his demands.

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:06.440
Just thinking about

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.800
working for him in the future,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.199
every penny Penglexuan earns

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:10.320
still having to give him a cut,

00:35:11.039 --> 00:35:12.519
I can't stand it.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.199
Lianbao.

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:16.199
A little impatience spoils great plans.

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.199
Anger is a major taboo in business.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.679
I know what you want to say,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.000
but I don't want to hear it right now.

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.639
This Kevin, as darn it as he is,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.280
he's not wrong in what he did.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:28.800
He just did what a businessman

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.880
is supposed to do:

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.920
maximize his own commercial value.

00:35:32.039 --> 00:35:32.760
I think

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.760
first, you need to separate the Honeycomb issue.

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:37.559
Kevin is right about this.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.239
The equity is in your hands,

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:40.920
but without his resources,

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.440
that equity is basically worthless.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.199
So what he did

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.559
is, relatively speaking, helping you get out of a bind.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.239
So according to you,

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:49.559
I should thank him?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.360
Objectively speaking, yes.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.039
As for how much money he makes with that equity,

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:56.079
that's his business, not yours.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.320
Our Penglexuan is just starting out.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.800
There's no need to burn bridges with him.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:01.440
Wait until our Penglexuan

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.800
is strong and thriving,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.320
then it won't be too late to challenge him.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.119
I won't accept it.

00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:06.760
Lianbao.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.000
Alright, alright, I know everything you say is right.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.320
I also know you mean well for me.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.119
Thank you.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.800
But no matter the cost,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.559
I must get Old Kai out.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:17.320
This isn't just a business matter.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.320
It's personal between him and me.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.360
Lianbao.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.000
Alright, alright.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.360
This isn't just a spur-of-the-moment impulse for me.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.199
I've thought it through carefully.

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.440
After Dong Qian's money comes in,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.639
the shares Old Kai holds will double in value anyway.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:31.760
If we buy those shares back now,

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.800
our stake in Penglexuan will be larger.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800
In the future, those shares

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.360
will definitely be worth more than they are now.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.000
I understand, but

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.559
we can't be so optimistic about things.

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:42.039
We have to consider the worst-case scenario first.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.000
If I let him keep walking all over me,

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:47.039
the rest of my life might as well be dead.

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:48.760
That is the worst outcome.

00:36:56.199 --> 00:36:57.360
I'm back!

00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:07.719
Why haven't you eaten?

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:10.480
I'm talking to you.

00:37:11.159 --> 00:37:13.320
I'm working on the script right now.

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:14.599
No time for that.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.800
Your, uh...

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.400
Put it in the fridge.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.840
I'll eat it in a bit.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.960
It's not just today, is it?

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.280
It's been several days now.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.960
What's going on with you?

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.039
If you're not feeling well,

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:27.400
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.519
No, no, don't.

00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:29.840
Stop, I'm fine.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.800
I'm begging you, okay?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.039
I'm begging you, don't disturb me.

00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:37.039
These past few days,

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:38.920
you've been staying up late every night.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.599
You get up at dawn and start writing again.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.079
Are you trying to ruin your health?

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.039
Stop writing.

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:47.679
You need to eat properly.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.360
See, see?

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.480
All my inspiration,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.079
you've just chattered it all away.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.559
Old lady, listen to me.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.360
The production company,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.199
they're meeting me in a couple of days.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.840
I'll just write for a little while, okay?

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.719
Just a little while.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:08.559
Qiu'er isn't short of work.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.800
Where did you get that idea?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.480
I'm not writing for his sake.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.960
I'm doing it for myself.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.480
Don't think I don't know.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.480
Before Qiu'er quit his job,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.480
you weren't writing like this,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.440
day and night.

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:33.760
Our Qiu'er is being so stubborn now,

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:37.239
isn't it just to keep us old folks from worrying?

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:37.960
Isn't that right?

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:40.760
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

00:38:41.559 --> 00:38:44.079
Plus, our Qiu'er is too picky.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.719
And on top of that, they're about to have a baby.

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:48.440
It's so hard.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.840
Just a little writing, a little writing.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.960
Aren't there his brothers?

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.559
He won't suffer.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.960
You, don't be like this.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.320
Just eat your meal properly.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.480
Come eat first, okay?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.559
I know my own condition.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.480
Let me tell you,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.840
I just want to finish the first few episodes.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.000
Finish them and sign the contract.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.440
Once the contract is signed,

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:15.440
the deposit will come through.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.000
Aren't you...

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.320
...feeling more at ease now?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:17.840
Right?

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840
Just a bit of writing, a bit.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.559
That's still not okay.

00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:20.079
No, no.

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:22.440
Alright, promise me one thing.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.440
Don't you dare tell our son about this.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.400
He's having such a hard time, too much pressure.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.559
Deal?

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:31.039
No.

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:32.840
You absolutely must not tell Qiu'er.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.440
Do you hear me?

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.719
He's under way too much pressure right now.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.760
Okay?

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:40.079
Fine.

00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:42.320
Let's eat first. I'll heat up the food.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.840
I never thought you still loved me this much.

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:18.159
Isn't it just to keep us old folks from worrying?

00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:19.039
Isn't that right?

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:21.800
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:25.079
Plus, our Qiu'er is too picky.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.679
And on top of that, they're about to have a baby.

00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:29.440
It's so hard.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.599
Hello, this is Tong Qiu.

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:46.800
I interviewed with your company.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.599
May I trouble you to ask,

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.159
do you have a result yet?

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:50.400
Are you crazy?

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:52.239
What time is it to be asking this?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.639
Don't I need to sleep?

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920
You don't even understand basic courtesy.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920
How could I hire you?

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.840
I'm sorry.
