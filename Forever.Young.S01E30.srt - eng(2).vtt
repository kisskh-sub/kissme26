WEBVTT

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120
Impossible.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.799
Absolutely impossible.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.719
Forget about the company agreeing,

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.519
I personally wouldn't agree either.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.959
Haven't I already explained this to you?

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.560
Using your company's name

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840
to buy out Kevin's shares

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.480
is the simplest and fastest way.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
We've just started cooperating,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.079
and you want to kick out an original shareholder.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.200
This will definitely affect

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.079
the company's confidence in this project.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.959
Besides,

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:03.840
asking us to fork out

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
so much money all at once,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.599
how could the boss possibly agree?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.960
He might even terminate the cooperation.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.840
I'm not asking your company to pay for nothing.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.759
Think about it.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.240
If Peng Le Xuan grows big, strong, and goes public,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.599
then the investment you make now

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.199
will also bring returns, won't it?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.439
Li Lianbao,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.560
this is not normal business conduct at all.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.599
It's purely acting on impulse.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.120
To put it bluntly,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.879
you still don't trust my judgment and ability.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
That's two completely different things.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.759
No matter what,

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.960
I have to kick Kevin out.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.120
If you can't help me,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
I'll figure it out myself.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.879
Li Lianbao!

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.719
Can you calm down right now?

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.960
Alright, stop talking.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.879
Li Lianbao, I haven't finished!

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.080
Li Lianbao!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.560
Stubborn mule.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.240
Sister Tongtong.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.479
Feifei.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400
So serious, carrying a notebook.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.560
Of course I am.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.280
Sis, how's your photography exhibition going?

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.319
Working on it.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.800
You know,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360
why I came back to Beijing to hold this exhibition?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.840
Let me tell you a story.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.400
Before my grandfather went abroad,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.919
he grabbed a handful of Beijing soil in the hutong,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.360
wanting to take it overseas.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.680
But it was later confiscated by customs.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.639
Then my father took a photo

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.800
of that handful of soil.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120
My deepest memory growing up

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.520
is often seeing my grandfather

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.240
staring blankly at that photo.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.520
My dad said,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.240
right before my grandfather passed,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.919
he was still clutching that photo in his hand.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.000
Chunsheng.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.639
Still worried about Second Brother's situation?

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.920
No, but as the eldest brother,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.439
I have to help him somehow.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.720
Even though Second Brother is your blood brother,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.639
when you and I got together,

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.519
his beard stubble wasn't even firm yet.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.399
What a good wife.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:44.759
Nothing is a big deal.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.360
Just help as much as you can.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.040
What are you doing?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.920
I'm fine.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.279
You two carry on.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.399
Carry on what? What are you doing?

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.240
What?

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.399
I have serious business.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.279
Here, take a look, you two.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.639
You've already decided on this school?

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.639
This one's good.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.519
This one's great.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.160
The doctor who treated my dad

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.639
graduated from this school, he's excellent.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:14.800
Right?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.639
Then let's go with this one, okay?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.759
Dad.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.399
You keep supervising my studies from now on.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:21.800
That schedule you made before,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.759
let's keep following it.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.240
And go running with me every day.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.360
How about it? Deal?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.519
Wishful thinking.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.079
Work hard on your own.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.519
The college entrance exam is right around the corner.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.399
Soon you'll be leaving home.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.120
From now on, you,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.120
the ocean's wide for the fish to leap, the sky's high for the bird to fly.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.439
No way, really?

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.920
You... you're really not going to manage me anymore?

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.439
The two of us,

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.680
we have our own things to do.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.680
Come on, Jing'er, get up here.

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.959
Alrighty.

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.920
There really isn't a spot for me here.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.439
Jing'er, look, see that moon?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.839
It's really bright.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.600
That moon represents my heart.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.639
Sing a few lines.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.560
Really sing?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.639
Sing.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.800
You ask how deep my love for you is,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.199
how much I love you.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.920
My feelings are true,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.439
my love is real.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:39.040
The moon represents my heart.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.199
A deep kiss...

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.879
Can you all hear me?

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.920
Let me give you a general overview first.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920
Motion capture

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.279
is a very new technology.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.079
Many movies

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.839
and TV shows are starting to use it.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.959
Let me explain it to you roughly.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.279
It digitizes the movements

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.839
of humans or

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.720
animals.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.839
It's used in analysis and animation production.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.519
For example, the production team

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.639
will capture an actor's performance.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.160
Good morning

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.600
What are you planning to do today?

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.600
No need to be so eager.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600
I'm not even ready yet.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.360
This is exactly the kind of authentic footage I want.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.040
It's not like I'm asking you to pose or anything.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.759
Don't mind me, just brush your teeth.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.160
Get some more close-ups.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.799
Making it look like a reality show.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.559
Natural, very natural like this.

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:37.879
Very lifelike.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.960
One, two.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.480
We can even get a shot together.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.080
Look.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.159
Look at me, like this.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.080
Two, three.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.120
Perfect.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.039
See?

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.399
It's really good, right?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.720
It's okay.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.279
What are you doing next?

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.120
Going to wash your face?

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.440
Just brushing my teeth.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.519
Is this okay?

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.039
Sure.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.879
Just brush.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.120
Buddy.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.320
This proposal...

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.720
I've had you revise it five times now.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.679
Do I really have to hold your hand through everything?

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.440
Now the client is here.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.200
And you're still not...

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.120
You're completely out of line!

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.200
Can you handle this or not?

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:17.679
The client is waiting!

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.519
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.360
Quick, quick!

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:22.080
You're passenger 3518, right?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.360
What's going on with you?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.120
The app said two minutes.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.440
I've been waiting over ten minutes!

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.639
Step on it!

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:40.120
I'm so sorry.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.080
I just missed the exit on the ring road.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.440
Had to go around again.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:46.679
I knew you were a new driver.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.519
Do you know how much I've had to delay

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.440
just waiting for you this morning?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.919
Yes, yes, I'm really, really sorry.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.000
W-wasted your time.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.519
I'll try to drive faster for you.

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.519
Drive faster!

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:57.240
Don't wait for the red lights!

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.519
What if there's traffic?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.679
Let me tell you...

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:00.679
If it weren't so hard to get a cab this morning,

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.759
I would've canceled on you.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.080
I should report you.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.440
No, no, Director Zhang.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.159
I wasn't talking about you.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.159
Not reporting you.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.320
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.679
I'm having a bit of a situation here.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:12.679
There's some traffic.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.320
Could you please wait just a little longer?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.639
I'm just around the corner.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.600
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.320
Okay, okay, okay.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.399
Okay, okay, okay.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.320
Alright, alright.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.120
See you soon, see you soon.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.159
Bro, we're not just around the corner.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.799
Stop with the nonsense.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.960
Hurry up.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.320
Please, don't try to talk me out of it anymore.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.080
I have to do this.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.360
Alright then.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:00.399
We won't try to stop you.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.879
Take this money.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.759
Use it for now.

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:08.000
These five hundred thousand, from Weiguo, you take it.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.519
You're really decided?

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:12.759
I don't agree with you.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.679
But I respect your decision.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.159
How much more do you need? I'll cover it.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.320
Logically speaking,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.639
I shouldn't support you.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.399
But in terms of friendship,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.879
unconditional support.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:35.679
Thank you all.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But I can't take this money.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.440
I have to handle this myself.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.240
No, what do you mean 'yourself'?

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.720
This isn't just your business either.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.039
Isn't this about Peng Le Xuan?

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.080
Take the money.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.639
Yeah.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.240
It's Peng Le Xuan's business.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240
Why are you being so polite?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.639
Making it feel distant.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.159
Can you come up with that much money alone?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.879
Don't you worry about that.

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:55.120
I have a way.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:03.240
Manager Zhang.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.000
So you've seen the apartment.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.519
Three bedrooms, one living room.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:09.840
Just renovated a couple of years ago.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.320
Usually just me living here.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.240
Rarely cook.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.759
The furniture is also very new.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:15.759
The place is decent.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
But, Boss Li,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.919
you know how it is.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.559
These days,

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:20.639
housing prices change every day.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.440
The price you mentioned...

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.840
won't sell quickly at all.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.519
I understand, I understand.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.799
The price is negotiable.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.519
It's just that...

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.279
I need the money urgently.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.960
Could you please list this apartment?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.480
Make it a priority, okay?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.039
Got it.

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:39.279
Price is negotiable, everything's flexible.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.559
Wait for my news then, I'm off.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:42.360
Alright.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.279
He's going all in.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.519
Exactly.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.039
And us brothers,

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.039
said we'd help him,

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:59.279
but he just won't have it.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.799
He insists on doing it himself.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.519
What I'm mainly afraid of

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:03.519
is that this move of his

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.519
will take all the savings he's built up over the years

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.039
and just throw it all away.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.559
This Li Lianbao...

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:11.919
How about

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.159
you try talking to him again?

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:15.559
Me?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.240
Big brother,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.440
You see, he won't even listen to you guys.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.720
Me talking to him...

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.320
No, it's not that.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.759
The relationship between us and him

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:27.480
is different from your relationship with him.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.679
What's the difference?

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.759
Him and I...

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:32.919
There's really nothing between us.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.000
No, no, no.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.720
We're not concerned with whether there is or isn't.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.480
But I know

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.679
the position you hold in his heart

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:39.480
is very important.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.360
Please, just try talking to him again.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.960
Alright then.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.440
I'll give it another try.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.159
Okay.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:51.440
It's about time.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.519
I'll head up first then, big brother.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.679
You... you go ahead with your business.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.519
I'm off.

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:56.039
Go on, hurry, tend to your things.

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:56.720
I'm leaving, big brother.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.600
Go on, go on.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.960
Waiter, the check please.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.240
They're over there.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.639
They've come back around.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.720
Xuanxuan.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.840
Yuanyuan.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.759
Do you want to play, Yuanyuan?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.720
Here.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.759
This is left and right.

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:21.960
This is forward and back.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.360
A remote control car, that's so cool!

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:25.000
You two can have a race.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360
Let Xuanxuan show you how.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.200
Back, back to the starting point.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.360
Yuanyuan, you play with Xuanxuan then.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.440
Let's come over here.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440
If you get thirsty, come find me for water.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:32.840
Come here.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.440
Okay.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:37.240
Play nicely with Yuanyuan.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.799
Things have been good lately.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.039
I thought I couldn't get you to meet up anymore.

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:02.080
Let's be clear first.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.600
Today is about spending time with the kids.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.519
If you're thinking of trying to persuade me again,

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.919
then let's just not talk about it.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.039
I'm not that much of a busybody.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
Besides being with the kids today,

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:16.799
I also wanted to thank you.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.440
Thank me?

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.440
That's a rare thing.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.200
Do you remember last time, also right here,

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.480
you brought Xuanxuan and Yuanyuan here to play?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.120
I was really furious that day.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.000
I said I'd finally managed to instill

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.159
some good habits in Xuanxuan,

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:36.679
and you went and ruined it all.

00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:40.240
But after going back home,

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.919
I thought about it more carefully.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.039
Ever since my divorce,

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.240
I've actually always felt in my heart

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.759
like I've really let Xuanxuan down.

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:51.200
I kept thinking about

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.799
how to give him a better future.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.200
But I never once thought about

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.799
whether these things are what he wants,

00:15:58.279 --> 00:15:59.519
whether he would be happy,

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.159
or whether he'd hate me in the future.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.519
Of course,

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.879
luckily you reminded me that day.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:07.759
So, thank you.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.159
It's nothing.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:16.440
And also,

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.080
that matter with Director Luo.

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:21.600
I know

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:23.639
you actually had my best interests at heart.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.679
Maybe my reaction that day was a bit over the top.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.639
I'm sorry.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.440
It's all in the past, no need to bring it up.

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.559
They crashed!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.559
Are you okay?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600
Who's broken?

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.240
We're both broken!

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:50.720
This part is broken.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.639
I'm not broken.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:53.399
This part of yours, this part fell off.

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:53.960
That's not mine.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960
No, no.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.600
Look here, look here.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.639
I've figured it out now.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.960
Sometimes for a person,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.000
taking a step back is also a step forward.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.440
You can't always force yourself to charge ahead.

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.640
If you don't hit the brakes in time,

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.880
you could very likely end up shattered to pieces.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.799
This sounds like there's something behind your words.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.799
Actually, Kevin is that wall in your heart.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.880
Right now, you just want to smash yourself to pieces against it.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.599
Right?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.119
You really took a long way around to say this.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.599
Lianbao.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.599
To put it bluntly,

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.640
you just can't stand

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.200
Kevin always being on top of you, right?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.160
Kevin is right in front of your face now.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.480
You can only see him.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.720
If you don't force yourself to take a few steps back,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.599
you won't be able to see anything else.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.160
You'll never beat him.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.480
Alright, alright, alright.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480
Stop talking.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.559
We just agreed earlier

00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:57.440
that today was about taking the kids out to play.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.720
No work talk.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.960
Aren't you usually pretty smart?

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.160
Right now, you're just the person in the game who's lost perspective.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.640
If you don't want to play with the kids,

00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:08.599
I'll just take Yuanyuan and head back first.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.680
Dad.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:55.200
Mom.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.640
Your mom... your mom went grocery shopping, right?

00:19:02.119 --> 00:19:03.680
Why do you keep staring at me?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.000
You're still here scribbling away furiously.

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:09.319
Take a break. Get some exercise, do some movement.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.799
Why do you keep staring at me?

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.839
I haven't been writing the whole time!

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:13.440
What?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.000
Not the whole time?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.200
Not the whole time, huh?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.000
No.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.640
Fine. As long as you weren't writing the whole time.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:26.039
Dad

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:28.839
About that job thing of mine

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:29.960
It's pretty much settled.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.839
Don't worry.

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:31.839
Really?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.559
That's great!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.279
You have an appointment slip?

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.640
What's going on?

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:44.759
Just... just running some errands.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:46.519
Alright.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.799
Your old man's fine.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.319
Son.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.839
Go on, go on.

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:55.799
Go do your thing.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:56.480
Okay.

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:59.000
You really should take it easy.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.400
I will, I will, I'll definitely rest.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.720
Dad's fine, go on.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.880
Even though Li Lianbao and I

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.359
had an agreement

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:41.039
not to interfere with each other's work,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.720
given his current situation,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.480
I'm really quite worried.

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:47.359
I can't just stand by and watch.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880
Yeah.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.640
Between people,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.880
once there's a bond,

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:54.519
it's hard to draw clear lines.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.240
Actually, on the surface right now,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.160
he's competing with Kevin,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.240
but in reality,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.720
he's competing with himself.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.680
He's angry with himself.

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:05.759
Exactly.

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:08.480
He just can't get over that hurdle in his own heart.

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:13.559
Anyway, I've said my harsh words,

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.880
and I've said my soft words.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.359
I've analyzed what needed analyzing,

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.480
and advised him as I should.

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:19.000
He just won't listen.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.359
How to put it...

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:25.960
It's easier to defeat an enemy in the mountains than one in your heart.

00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:27.359
That's his obsession.

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.640
It's also that very drive

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.039
that got him to where he is today.

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:32.960
If you suddenly ask him to let it go now,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.759
I think he'd lose himself.

00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:36.240
Then what should we do?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.440
We can't just

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.759
watch him struggle like this forever.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.240
I'm worried that

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.799
if something else happens to him,

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:45.000
it'll be really hard for him to get back up.

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:54.279
I have a not-so-brilliant idea.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:56.359
It might work,

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.039
but I need your help.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.519
What method?

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:03.319
How is it?

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.039
Let me adjust it.

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:05.599
Okay.

00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:09.039
Ready?

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:09.480
Okay.

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:14.559
Director Li is my benefactor.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.039
He's also my buddy.

00:22:16.799 --> 00:22:17.720
Without Director Li,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720
my Hive Technology

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.759
might have been done for long ago.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.599
During my toughest time,

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:23.880
it was Old Li who lent a helping hand.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.279
He helped us pull through the crisis.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.759
Of course, for Director Li,

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:28.599
it might have been a simple favor,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.519
but for Hive Technology back then,

00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:31.960
it was a matter of life and death.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.519
Even though he's withdrawn now,

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.599
I believe

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.440
he must have his reasons for withdrawing.

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:39.279
Personally, I'm still extremely, extremely grateful to him.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.119
Therefore,

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:42.200
if Hive Technology ever goes public,

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:44.440
I will definitely invite you

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.119
to come ring the bell with me.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.240
Good.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.119
That's good.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:51.559
Good, good, good.

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:52.279
That works, that works.

00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:53.480
Thank you.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.640
It's the least I could do.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.559
Are you okay?

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:26.759
I'm fine.

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:27.720
What's wrong?

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.880
Nothing, nothing, I'm completely fine.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.559
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:34.519
You go ahead, it's fine.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.200
Really, you're okay?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.279
I'm fine.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.359
Doing great.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.640
Son.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.599
Dad?

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:27.759
It's your dad.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.680
You

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.640
need to come over right away.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.680
What's wrong? What happened over there?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.039
Your dad's appetite is really good today.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.559
I want to eat some fried liver.

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:46.960
That stuff has way too much cholesterol.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.240
Why would you eat that?

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.480
No, no, no.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.559
I really want fried liver today.

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.680
Be a good son.

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:54.759
Dad...

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:58.079
If you're not busy,

00:24:58.599 --> 00:24:59.720
come over quickly.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.880
Hurry up.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.200
Alright, alright, I'm not busy, I'll come right now.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.279
Coming right now.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.599
Good son.

00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:07.480
Dad loves you.

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:58.440
Son

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.559
Being cooped up in

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.480
Courtyard 36 every day,

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:04.440
and then suddenly coming out here,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.079
this place has changed so much.

00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:07.960
I've been telling you,

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.720
don't just stay holed up at home.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.759
It's so much better to get out and stroll around more.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.000
No, I have to write my book.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:16.880
Alright, alright, alright.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.559
Dad,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.559
how come you suddenly got a craving for fried liver today?

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:25.240
Right after we moved from Guanzhuang to the city,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.519
I saw lots of people eating this stuff.

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:29.319
I tried a couple bites,

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:31.160
couldn't swallow it.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.039
Later on,

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.319
accompanying, uh...

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.200
what's-his-name's dad...

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.160
Accompanying Weiguo's dad.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.240
Right, right, Weiguo's dad.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.160
Spent a long time with him,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.440
always went with him to eat it.

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:42.000
Later, when I savored the taste,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.480
it started to grow on me.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.839
Not bad.

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:47.039
I really didn't know

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.720
this place only serves breakfast.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.920
Closes so early.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.359
Tonight, I'll go to the Shazikou area

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:54.000
and at least bring you back a couple of bowls.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:55.960
Don't bother, why go to all that trouble?

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.240
Don't.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.720
What trouble is it? Honestly.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.000
Not eating it. No, no, no.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.920
From now on, when you want to go out,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.000
just tell me if you want to stroll around.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.160
It's not like there's traffic at midday anyway, right?

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:05.440
Here's what we'll do.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.720
I, after I'm done working today,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.039
I'll be passing by Hufangqiao anyway.

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:10.240
I'll bring you some fried cakes,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.240
fermented bean juice, that sort of thing.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.519
That fermented bean juice is good.

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:15.079
Your old man loves drinking that the most.

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.440
Sour and tangy.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.960
You gotta have some pickled vegetable shreds ready.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.720
Pickled vegetable shreds.

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:19.839
Deep-fried dough rings, mustard greens.

00:27:19.839 --> 00:27:20.680
Deep-fried dough rings.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.440
Fried dough twists.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.920
Fried dough twists.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.640
Get it all prepared.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.839
I'll have it all ready for you, don't worry.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:24.680
Authentic, authentic.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.279
What's wrong? Why are you coughing?

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.000
Are you okay?

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:30.160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:30.920
You sure?

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.880
Alright, alright, drive carefully, drive carefully.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.000
This kid.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.519
It's nothing, rest assured.

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:36.559
Your dad will keep an eye out for you.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.559
No need, it's fine.

00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:44.920
I'm taking some video, for keepsakes.

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:47.000
It hasn't been easy.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:24.559
Alrighty.

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:25.119
Alrighty.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:25.960
Alrighty.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.400
Got it, take it slow.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200
Open the door for me.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.160
Coming!

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.519
Come on, come on.

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:36.880
Take it easy, take it easy.

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:39.559
We're home.

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:42.480
Getting old.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.440
You're not old.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.599
What do you mean not old?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.200
Qiu'er,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.799
you, uh...

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:48.960
you go attend to your business.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.000
I'm fine here.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.519
Okay, then I'll try to come back early today.

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:53.200
If you get hungry,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.680
have some snacks to tide you over first.

00:28:56.319 --> 00:28:57.519
Drive safe.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.680
I know, I know.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.480
I'm off.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:28:59.920
Okay.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.240
Obey the traffic rules.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.319
Bye-bye.

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:31.319
Kid.

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:32.359
Uncle Tong.

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:34.319
So busy he can't even hear.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.359
How do you say 'busy'? Let me see.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:41.279
So good.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.559
Time flies like a shuttle.

00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:55.799
When your aunt and I moved to Baofang Hutong,

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.000
that was already forty years ago.

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.079
Yeah.

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:00.839
A person's lifetime,

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.880
can seem very long, yet also very short.

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.039
Look,

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:06.599
look at Qiu'er, he's almost forty now.

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:08.160
Look at this little face.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.160
In my mind, it's just like yesterday.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.079
Uncle Tong,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.079
you and Aunt Tong are in better health now,

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:20.480
so Qiu'er can rest easy.

00:30:20.839 --> 00:30:21.519
As for you,

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:23.240
don't always do so much for him.

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.599
The more you do,

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:25.680
the less he does.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.839
The less he does,

00:30:26.839 --> 00:30:28.160
the less he progresses in his work.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.559
That way, it backfires, right?

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.319
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.599
The reasoning is sound.

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:40.759
But tell me, as parents,

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:43.279
who doesn't worry about their own children?

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:47.279
Even those without children,

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:49.319
surely have someone they care about in their hearts.

00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:50.079
Isn't that right?

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:54.440
Great, let me see.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.799
Has a name been chosen for this exhibition?

00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:03.680
Thought of a few, but haven't decided.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.160
Perfect!

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.039
I'll come up with one.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.440
Let me think.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.519
"With bamboo staff and straw sandals, lighter than a horse."

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:29.759
"Speaking of a bountiful year amidst the fragrance of rice blossoms."

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.880
Write it, write this down.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.799
Let's see.

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:49.640
Youth

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:50.960
What do you think?

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:53.039
Take a look.

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.039
It's quite good.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.599
It has that relaxed lightness,

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.240
and the bounty of a fruitful year.

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.680
One line is by Su Dongpo,

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:04.599
the other by Xin Qiji.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.799
Both are poets of the heroic, unrestrained school.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.680
It's very fitting.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960
Uncle Tong, it really takes you.

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:12.720
Kid,

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.599
all those thoughts in your heart,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.519
I understand them completely.

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:21.720
You think you're all prepared,

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.319
but kid,

00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:25.599
you're not at that stage yet.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.960
Death

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.960
is truly terrifying.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.400
It's better to be alive.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.000
Right?

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:40.079
These two lines

00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:42.359
are our mutual encouragement, you and I.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.920
Alright then.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.000
Bye now.

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.759
It's fine. I was just finishing up that script.

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:07.000
I was actually planning

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.599
to tidy up and then come find you.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.199
What's up?

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.519
I was thinking,

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.760
this time, maybe fate

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.079
will be on my side.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.360
I've decided.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.440
I've thought it through clearly.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.760
I'm going to have the surgery.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.039
Okay?

00:34:58.719 --> 00:34:59.400
Okay.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.320
Old Tong, out for a stroll?

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.119
Uncle Tong, out for a walk?

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.599
Hello, hello, hello.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.119
Uncle Tong.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.440
Old Tong's out!

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.000
Hello.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:45.920
Uncle Tong.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.440
Hello.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.960
Uncle Tong.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.639
Uncle Tong.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.119
Uncle Tong, going for a walk?

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:53.679
Just a little stroll.

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:54.559
Take it easy now.

00:35:57.559 --> 00:35:58.679
Just wandering around.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.679
Out for a walk?

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:48.559
Alright, alright, I got it. Okay.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.360
What's with Uncle Tong? Something's off.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.440
Let's go check on him.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.119
Uncle Tong! Uncle Tong!

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:56.480
Why is he sleeping here?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.480
Uncle Tong?

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.079
Grandpa Tong!

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.039
Old Tong!

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.079
Uncle Tong!

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.800
What happened?

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.119
Call 120, quick!

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:08.480
Press his philtrum! Press his philtrum!

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:11.159
Don't crowd around! Don't crowd around!

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:28.840
Once your wife gets pregnant,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.880
the financial pressure will be huge, right?

00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:34.639
Those two medicines are insanely expensive.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.039
I told the doctor to stop them.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.760
Don't think I don't know.

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:03.320
When Qiu'er hadn't quit her job,

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.320
you weren't writing like this,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.199
day and night.

00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:09.280
You know how hard it is to find a job now.

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.599
And our Qiu'er is too picky for some jobs, overqualified for others.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.239
Plus, they're about to have a baby soon.

00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:16.960
It's just too difficult.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.639
Come eat first, alright?

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:22.639
I know my own illness.

00:40:23.519 --> 00:40:24.559
Let me tell you,

00:40:24.559 --> 00:40:26.719
I just want to finish the first few episodes.

00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:27.320
That's still not okay.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:27.840
No, no.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.239
Alright, promise me one thing.

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:33.239
Don't you dare tell our son about this.

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:36.280
He's having such a hard time, the pressure is too much for him.

00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:39.679
Qiu'er! Qiu'er!

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.840
What's going on here?

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.480
You look all wilted,

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.000
like you've lost your soul.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.119
It's nothing, nothing.

00:40:46.119 --> 00:40:48.119
Nothing? That can't be right.

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:49.480
It's fine, really fine.

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:52.239
If it's nothing, why are you sweating bullets? What's wrong?

00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:53.079
Really, really nothing.

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:53.639
There's definitely something.

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:54.280
It's nothing.
