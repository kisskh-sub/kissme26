[Episode 27]

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.900
[Linji Prefectural Office]

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.200
My Lord, why did you
summon me back so urgently?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.190
Take a look at this.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.930
A reward notice from the Rong family.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.680
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.350
is a rare and valuable book
printed during the Song dynasty.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.040
Rong Shanbao

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.970
likely wants to use it
to please the Empress Dowager.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.210
What do you think?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.870
My Lord, if you trust me,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.600
please leave

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.350
this matter to me.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.430
What's your plan?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.030
Please wait and see, My Lord.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.440
I will make sure Rong Shanbao

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.560
falls into the abyss.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.890
These days, with all
that's happening at the Rong family,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.550
everyone is feeling anxious.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.190
I can see they

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.560
have completely lost
interest in processing tea.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.500
They've even ruined

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.930
many freshly picked tea leaves.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.329
We might as well
let them rest for a few days.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.530
That's fine.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.910
Shanbao.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.800
Do you know who

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
is behind the attacks on our family?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.360
Naturally, it's someone who despises
the Rong family the most.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.690
After all, a few days ago

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.240
he was just at our tea plantation

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
where he lost face

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.090
and lost his trusted aide.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.390
Him?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.150
How could he possibly control

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.480
people from our family?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.320
Lady Shanbao!

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.530
Someone has responded to the reward notice

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.530
and has come here.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.310
Be more vigilant these days.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.370
Jiang Yiqian has ill intentions.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.660
He definitely won't spare

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.660
this place where he was humiliated.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.600
I understand.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.270
Please show him in.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.360
Come in, please.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.170
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.820
is in your possession?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.950
Lady Shanbao.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.190
I escaped
from the Wei family years ago

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.000
and have been hiding all these years.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.590
Now I'm too ashamed to go back.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.550
Please keep this matter confidential.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.570
Don't tell the Wei family

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.829
about my whereabouts.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.590
I'm only here for

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.050
the "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.930
Other matters don't concern me.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.390
I certainly won't gossip.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.020
In the reward notice,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.900
the Rong family promised one condition.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.430
Is it truly anything I want?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.680
If the Rong family can fulfill it,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.630
we will see to it.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.630
Good.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.430
Please follow me.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.640
Miss, please have a seat.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.430
I've put the book in the inner room.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.269
Please, Miss,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.019
write the agreement first

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.950
and I'll go inside to get it for you.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.480
Alright.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.460
My Lady.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.260
Go report to the authorities.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.480
Wei!

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.040
Wei, look.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.460
I've brewed a new pot of wine for you.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.390
Wei.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.320
Wei?

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.210
Something's wrong!

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.480
Murder!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.500
Murder!

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040
My Lord, bad news!

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.220
Lady Rong Shanbao has been captured.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.460
Is your leg feeling better, Old Madam?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.070
I still can't get out of bed,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.410
though I can move a little bit.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.600
Your condition

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.110
naturally requires gradual recovery.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.920
Given time,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.970
you will surely return
to your former health, Old Madam.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.830
After lying here for so many days,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.160
you're the only one

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.160
who comes to see me from time to time.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.820
That ungrateful girl

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.430
is probably still holding
a grudge against me.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.430
She hasn't shown her face even once.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.510
What lasting grudge could exist
between grandmother and granddaughter?

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.110
Old Madam,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.510
the most important thing for you now

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.570
is to rest quietly.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.190
The household matters

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.190
will be handled by the young ladies.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.970
Why do I feel

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.290
that recently the mansion

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.430
seems much quieter?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.620
What's the matter?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.909
It's nothing.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.990
Just some personal affairs.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.540
I should take my leave now.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.220
I'll visit you another day, Old Madam.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.510
You heard correctly?

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.750
Lady Shanbao has killed someone?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.650
There's no mistake.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.040
Someone has identified her.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040
It's already been brought to court.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.560
[Linji Prefectural Office]

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.070
My Lord.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.720
I am a neighbor of Wei Zhou.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.870
I saw

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.390
the three of them enter the house.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.250
Shortly after,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.190
Lady Shanbao's maid

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.090
suddenly rushed out in a hurry.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.180
I never expected

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.920
to walk into the room

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.510
and find my neighbor

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.890
lying on the floor,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.360
his head covered in blood.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.120
Are you certain you only saw

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.720
Miss Rong and her maid

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.330
enter that room today?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.159
Yes.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.560
I was actually

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.580
standing guard outside the whole time.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.110
When I went in with the wine,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.660
I saw that the doors and windows
of Wei Zhou's house were tightly shut,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.740
with only Miss Rong present.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.820
You took one hasty glance

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.790
and noticed the windows?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.900
How observant of you.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.410
What's wrong with that?

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.180
We've been neighbors for many years,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.330
so I know

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.640
there's only one window in his house,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.080
and I naturally noticed it right away.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.160
Miss Rong.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.600
I understand that you

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.060
went to great lengths
for the birthday gift,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.690
but that doesn't justify

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.080
taking someone's life.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.480
I went to Wei Zhou's house

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.720
indeed for

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.980
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.040
But he went alone

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.900
to get the book when he was killed.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.200
I have no idea

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.309
who killed him,

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.190
or why.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.919
I went with him to make a deal.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.330
On what grounds am I
accused of murder for money?

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.150
That makes sense.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.270
But she was the only one there.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.530
She must be the killer.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440
My Lord.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.600
Actually,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.080
my neighbor

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.720
mentioned to me before

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.150
that he wanted to use his book collection

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.080
in exchange for

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.180
half of the Rong family's fortune.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.660
Indeed,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.000
what he did

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.250
was somewhat greedy.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.670
But Miss Rong,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.160
if you didn't want to give it to him,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.550
you didn't have to

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.960
take his life.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.350
The man is dead,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.940
and these words

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.090
are clearly your fabrication.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.890
Rong Shanbao!

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.250
Wei Zhou was murdered
while alone with you.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.150
What else can you say?

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.110
He claims I killed for money,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.790
so where is

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:23.990
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.550
that I supposedly stole?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.970
Isn't it obvious?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200
Her personal maid

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.790
must have taken

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.630
the stolen goods

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.870
when she fled

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.150
in panic.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:33.840
My Lord,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.390
I urge you to interrogate her thoroughly.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.000
Under torture,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.770
she will surely confess.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.320
Guards!

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.830
Your Excellency.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.750
Lord Lu.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.880
Why has Lord Lu come?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.360
Lord Lu is here.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.600
Investigating cases and passing judgment

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.000
is my duty.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.150
Lord Jiang, why have you condescended

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.610
to investigate this case personally?

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.900
You and Rong Shanbao are close friends.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.760
You should recuse yourself from this case.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.130
Then, Lord Jiang,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.120
you've confronted

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.150
Miss Rong at the tea plantation.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.290
Should you not recuse yourself as well

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.080
to avoid others

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.830
thinking you're seeking personal revenge?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.040
I've invited Lord Luo

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.680
to observe this case.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.040
What's wrong?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.440
Are you suggesting

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.460
Lord Luo is not fair either?

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.150
Lord Luo

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.040
is certainly just and fair.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.200
It's just that this case

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.200
still has many suspicious aspects.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.380
Lord Jiang, you intend to proceed
with the punishment.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.600
Do you intend to extract
a false confession?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.330
Lu Jianglai.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.970
You're letting personal feelings

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.190
interfere with court proceedings.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.270
Lord Jiang, don't change the subject.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.270
I'm saying this case is suspicious.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.550
Being in the same room with the deceased

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.150
doesn't automatically
make one the murderer.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.610
That's far too arbitrary.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.360
Everyone knows that Rong Shanbao

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.390
spared no effort

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.940
for "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.550
She was the only one at the murder scene.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.720
The motive for murder
has been established.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720
Is that being arbitrary?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.120
Currently, "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.720
is still nowhere to be found.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.510
The most urgent matter

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.960
is to locate the book

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.800
rather than punishing an innocent person.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.210
You...

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.040
Since you two cannot come to an agreement,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.910
then this case

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.670
will be personally examined by me.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.150
This matter

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.130
began with a birthday gift.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.240
The Empress Dowager's birthday

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.360
should be celebrated throughout the land

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560
and must not be tainted with bloodshed.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.350
Miss Rong.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.680
I have witnessed the influence
of the Rong family

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.840
in Linji over the past few days.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.920
First the birthday gift was ruined,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.720
and then it became
entangled in a murder case.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.150
If this case is proven,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.960
no one can save the Rong family.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.670
Guards!

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.150
Take Rong Shanbao

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.440
into custody.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.730
Yes, My Lord.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.700
My Lord, you need not worry.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.680
Wei Zhou and his neighbor

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.940
are people I arranged.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120
They never actually had

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.380
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.390
As long as she has the murder motive,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.650
no matter how eloquent

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.910
Rong Shanbao is,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.240
she cannot escape punishment.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.240
How did Wei Zhou die?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.630
Suicide.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.740
Wei Zhou had been ill for a long time

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.470
and didn't have much time left.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.110
He wanted to leave a dowry for

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.480
his daughter who left

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.750
with her remarried mother.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.080
So I paid him handsomely

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.280
and bought his life.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.770
No matter how this case is investigated,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.030
there will only be Rong Shanbao

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.000
as the murderer.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.740
Brilliant!

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.360
However, Mr. Bai,

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.390
there's blood on your hands.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720
Aren't you afraid

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.880
it might affect your official career?

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.270
Consider this as my

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.890
pledge of loyalty to you, My Lord.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.840
My future path

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.210
will greatly depend on your support.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.880
Rest assured.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.240
In the future,

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.070
I will certainly help you
rise to great heights.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.700
Mr. An,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.910
where are you heading?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.360
I...

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.920
Mr. An,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.550
I'm returning to Rong Mansion now.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.870
Before I leave,
I want to remind you of something.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.470
A person can't be too greedy.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.560
If you want a peaceful life,

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.660
you must give up something.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.630
Can I have a word with you?

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.880
From the very beginning

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.650
you've all been lying to me.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.910
You don't really think

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.370
that good fortune
falls from the sky, do you?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.270
You should be grateful

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.870
that you still have some use.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.530
Otherwise, who would even notice you?

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.120
You're doing quite well

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.630
at the Provincial Governor's Office.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.510
It's better than having

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.240
that heartless Lady Yunxi

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.150
who refuses to acknowledge your existence.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.630
She is not heartless.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.170
I made this choice willingly.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.750
Lord Jiang is not

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.880
a man of good temper.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.220
I advise you not to be foolish again.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.160
If you serve Lord Jiang,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.370
he will certainly treat you well.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.320
When the Rong family falls,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.700
you and your daughter

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.620
will rise to great heights.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.430
Hurry up. Don't take too long.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.510
Mr. Yan.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.320
Why are you here?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.910
They're wrongfully accusing you,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.640
aren't they?

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.870
Yes.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.080
Is there any way out of this?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.440
They've set a trap

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.270
waiting for me to fall in.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.570
They'll certainly make me pay dearly.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.650
I have an answer to that question

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.190
you asked me last time.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.600
What is it?

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.120
I'm willing.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.000
Lady Shanbao.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.730
I'm willing to stay,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.060
even without the Rong family.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.150
All my life,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.870
every decision I've made

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.000
has required careful consideration.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:51.860
But that day,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:52.840
I didn't promptly

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.100
answer your question.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.780
I've regretted it for days.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.660
I believe

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.920
this is my answer.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.520
Even if this time

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.320
you have no way to clear your name,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.270
I'll do everything possible

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.930
to save you.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.400
Even if it means

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.200
we become fugitives afterward.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.980
As long as you trust me.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.050
-You...
-Shut up if you can’t save her.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.680
Why talk about becoming fugitives
when there's no need?

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.310
Mr. Yan,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.060
I need to discuss the case
with Lady Shanbao.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.200
Please excuse us.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.620
Mr. Yan, please go back first.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.800
I understand

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.450
your feelings.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:04.590
Look,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.920
a pure, flawless disciple of Buddha

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.920
is willing to flee
with you to the ends of the earth.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.350
How touching.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.720
Speak properly.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.740
What exactly are you planning?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.900
Looking for a book

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.240
and somehow
getting yourself thrown in jail.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.830
There are too many people

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.200
watching me like hawks.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.540
I can't guard against them all.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.110
What are you

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.740
planning to do next?

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.860
I don't believe you'll just admit defeat.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.270
I have a plan.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.110
I need your help.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.230
What do you want me to do?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.060
I should warn you beforehand.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.270
This matter carries enormous risk.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.110
One misstep,

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.610
and you could be dragged down as well.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.280
So what?

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.440
Someone already has the role

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.570
of fleeing with you.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.940
I should at least have

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.670
the title of sharing your fate.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.030
Lady Yunshu,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.140
you're still in the mood
to tend to these flowers?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.400
Tomorrow will be the fifth day.

It seems you haven't heard.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.680

Impossible.

She's not that foolish.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.300
It's often the clever ones

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.360
who make mistakes.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.230
You framed her.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.250
I wasn't ruthless enough back then.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.500
I should have let you die in the river.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.200
Sorry to disappoint you.

out of resentment,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.380
burned down the Tea King Tree.

may fight for power,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.510
but would never betray each other

This set of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.850
belongs to my Wei family collection.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.100
During the confiscation years ago,

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.100
it was hidden in a screen by my family

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.930
and escaped being seized.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.270
I've been hiding it all these years.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.750
No matter how difficult life became,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.910
I endured and persevered.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.030
I chose to hang on a bit longer.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.550

when we couldn't make ends meet anymore,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.210
I would take it out and sell it.

there was a murder in town
because of this book.

was truly filled with anxiety.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.120
So I brought this book

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.200

this is "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"?

That's right.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.560
Back then, Wei Kejian

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.830
built a library

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.790
and kept this Song Dynasty edition

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.830
as his family's most treasured possession.

Before the library caught fire,

Wei Kejian

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.360
had already hidden

this set of books away.

By chance,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.000
it ended up in my possession.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.200
If this collection is in your hands,

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.160

and died unnaturally,

was lying.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.030
In that case,

Lady Rong Shanbao's motive for murder

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.420
becomes even more nonexistent.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.880
Whether it's true or not,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.480
how can we rely on one person's word?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.480
Lord Jiang, previously

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.510
you also just believed

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.960
the testimony
of Wei Zhou's neighbor, didn't you?

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.400
Now that the real "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.200
has appeared,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.070
it proves that Wei Zhou and his neighbor

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.200
had ill intentions.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.640
Perhaps they conspired together

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.270
to deceive Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.160
but quarreled over dividing the spoils.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.440
After accidentally killing Wei Zhou,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.030
the neighbor framed Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.760
Lu Jianglai,

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.000
your reasoning

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.480
is far too arbitrary.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.000
Lord Jiang, you only relied on hearsay

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.230
to conclude that Lady Rong Shanbao

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.020
killed someone for a set of books.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.080
Isn't that equally arbitrary?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.930
Nonsense!

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.880
Enough!

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.240
This case has too many suspicious points.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.170
How can we make wild speculations?

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.900
First, we need someone
to verify
if this set of books is authentic.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.750
Tomorrow,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.260
I will investigate
until the truth comes to light.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.740
Lord Luo, you're wise.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.960
Although I spoke

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.690
in righteous terms at the time,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.230
on reflection

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.530
I still felt a measure of unease.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.790
That woman, Ms. Chang,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.830
out of gratitude

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.240
for my help with her case,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.720
was willing to bring a fake copy

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.780
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku" as evidence,

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.380
but a fake is still a fake.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.020
If it's discovered,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.880
the punishment will be even more severe,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.210
and we'll never
be able to clear our names.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.810
I've already told you before

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.640
this matter carries enormous risk.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.300
I'm not worried about myself.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.120
I only worry whether you can

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.550
see this through safely.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.070
I've been offering a generous reward
for so many days

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.670
but still haven't found
any trace of this book.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.750
I suspect the book

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.960
was probably destroyed

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.490
in that fire at the library.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:49.920
Probably?

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.680
Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.480
when did your actions

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.880
become so questionable?

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.830
You're overlooking something.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.310
What?

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.310
Few people

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.400
have ever seen the real

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.660
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku."

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.770
Have you thought about

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.970
how to conclude this?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.840
Surely

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.030
you don't really intend to present
a fake Song Dynasty edition

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.360
to the Empress Dowager?

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.650
That would be a serious crime.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.340
The real Song Dynasty edition
no longer exists.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.400
Now if we say

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.200
what Ms. Chang has is authentic,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.790
then it is authentic.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.560
Are you hiding something from me?

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.990
You've helped me so much.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.960
I've been completely honest with you.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.270
That Rong Shanbao

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.130
is truly reckless beyond belief.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.480
She actually thought of

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.740
using this method to break the deadlock.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.630
That old woman

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.430
who owes Lu Jianglai a debt of gratitude

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.400
must have been used
by them to create this deception.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400
This is good news.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.510
Lu Jianglai is rushing here
to his own death.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.110
We can catch them all at once.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:58.920
Okay.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.830
I'll go right now
to instruct that neighbor

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.050
to stick firmly to the story
that Rong Shanbao committed murder.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.120
If he dares to waver...

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.520
No need for that trouble.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.290
Come over here and look.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.830
The authentic "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.640
is in my hands.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:25.350
Rong Shanbao

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.810
walked right into the trap herself.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.960
Is this book authentic?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.000
I got this

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.640
from Wei Kejian before.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.760
It's absolutely authentic.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.120
Just tell them

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.480
you found this book during the search.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.200
An Cha and his daughter
are at the County Office now.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.400
Send a letter

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.460
to Lady Rong Yunxi.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.830
Ask her to testify

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.570
that she saw this book at your place.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.080
This will ensure Rong Shanbao

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.480
can never clear her name.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.570
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.830
I will certainly complete this mission.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.880
I want to play a little game with you.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.160
No matter what happens,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160
you must not make any noise.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.750
Alright?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.030
Good girl.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.840
Come.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.970
Now,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.260
I'll cover you with this.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:27.740
Okay?

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.130
This way!

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.550
They ran this way!

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.150
Hurry!

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.990
Split up and chase them!

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.520
Yes, sir.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.340
Li, listen carefully.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.440
That tea plantation ahead

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.590
is where you used to live.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.520
Do you remember?

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.550
I want to play a game with you.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.440
Let's have a race.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.750
Whoever gets there first wins.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.240
Okay?

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:44.020
Go.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.370
That direction.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.000
Hurry.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.990
I'll be right behind you.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:49.870
Li, be good.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.350
Remember to go to the plantation

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.830
and find

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.160
the big sister
who took care of you before.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.030
Run quickly.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.750
Don't fall.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.070
Don't look back.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:29.920
Tell me

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.210
where your daughter is.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.280
You won't talk? Beat him!

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.080
Stop!

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.310
I'm sorry.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.360
You fool.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.220
[Linji Prefectural Office]

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.440
Our Wei family

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.810
have also been wrongfully accused

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.530
and suffered humiliation.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.790
Today I step forward

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.640
because I don't want

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.390
to see another Wei family
suffer the same fate.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.160
I don't want innocent people

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.190
to be wrongfully accused again.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.110
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.310
has always been hidden by me

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.590
and never fell into others' hands.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.350
This precious book

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.880
carries

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.250
all the wisdom

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.960
of our ancestors throughout history.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.160
It should not become

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.850
evidence for false accusations.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.360
A housewife with such noble character.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.840
We who serve in court

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.590
should be even more discerning

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.720
and uphold justice.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.310
Lord Luo,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.360
how is the verification of
the Song Dynasty edition going?

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.550
Rong Shanbao,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.430
I ask you:

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.510
do you truly not know why Wei Zhou

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.510
died?

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.310
Lord Luo,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.110
I've already stated clearly before.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.400
I went to Wei Zhou's house

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.510
to make a deal.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.440
Even if the deal falls through,
we can still part as friends.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.480
The Rong family has never

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.210
bullied others with our power.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.240
Not to mention murder and robbery.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.590
As for why Wei Zhou

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.880
died in a room

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.810
with all doors and windows locked,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.660
I'm afraid only he himself

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.810
and this good neighbor would know.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:45.960
When Wei Zhou died,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.360
I wasn't even in the room.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.880
How dare you slander me?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.640
You didn't actually see me kill anyone.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.400
You only saw Wei Zhou after he was dead,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.860
when I was in the same room.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.640
What grounds do you have
to falsely accuse me of murder?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.710
You... I...

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.160
Lord Luo.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.550
This case is very clear.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.590
Someone powerful

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.160
holds a grudge against me

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.760
because of past grievances.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.200
Knowing I was looking for

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.460
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku",

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:11.980
he set a trap

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.850
to lure me into Wei Zhou's house,

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.110
then committed murder

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.410
and framed me for it.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.590
I will investigate
Wei Zhou's death thoroughly.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.550
Since there's insufficient evidence,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.350
Rong Shanbao,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.740
you may return to the Rong family.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.690
But before this case is resolved,

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.510
you must not leave Linji.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.370
Thank you, Lord Luo.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.480
Ma'am.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.720
I wish to buy your copy
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.750
at a high price.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.110
Would you

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.090
be willing to part with it?

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.870
Lady Shanbao, if you like it,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.480
I'll simply give it to you.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.720
I only ask that

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.340
if Wei's descendants ever face hardship,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.140
Lady Shanbao,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.390
you would lend them a helping hand.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.050
Okay.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.440
I promise.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.710
Thank you.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.310
Lord Luo,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.200
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.110
is the crystallization
of countless people's devotion and labor.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.170
Books are innocent

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.990
and shouldn't be tainted
by worldly desires.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.310
I humbly dare to present
this work as a birthday tribute,

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.370
and ask that Your Lordship accept it.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.500
Wait.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:36.920
Lord Luo,

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.610
This copy of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:40.360
is fake.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.020
The authentic one is in my hands.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.380
My surname is Bai,
courtesy name Yingsheng,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.280
a student from Wanfeng Academy.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.830
Since childhood,

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.480
I've loved collecting old books.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.350
This Song Dynasty edition

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.150
has been in my collection for 2 years.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.350
A few days ago, I heard

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.800
someone was passing off
a fake as authentic,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800
so I hurried here.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.480
The matter of authenticity
shouldn't concern me.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.000
But

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.070
I study the classics,

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.830
and cannot stand to see this used

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.900
to deceive the sovereign.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.590
Madam Wei,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.690
how do you explain this?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.000
I... I...

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.290
You claim yours is authentic.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.929
How can you prove it?

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.489
A reproduction

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.159
is naturally inferior to the original.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.550
The difference between these two

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.030
is obvious to anyone.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.620
Lord Jiang,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.470
I've heard

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.100
you're also a book collector.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.320
Perhaps

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.870
you could help determine
which is authentic.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.170
Okay.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.760
Li.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.360
Li.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.660
Li.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.240
You're awake.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.140
Lady Yunxi.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.440
Jiang Yiqian

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.320
and Bai Yingsheng

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.030
are plotting against Lady Shanbao.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.230
And that Wei Zhou too.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.300
He and his neighbors

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.500
are working for them.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.030
They also want to use Li

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.920
to blackmail you into helping them
coordinate their testimonies.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.580
Where is Li?

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.420
Did she make it safely
to the tea plantation?

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.840
I'm sorry.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.010
Xiangling is taking care of Li.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:18.940
That's good.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.420
By the way,

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.400
is the trial today?

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.840
I can testify.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.190
I heard with my own ears

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.030
Bai Yingsheng and Jiang Yiqian's

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.760
conspiracy.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.230
You risked your life

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.880
escaping from
the Provincial Governor's Office

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.280
just to tell me this?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:35.840
I'm so sorry.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.320
Before,

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.330
I believed the slander

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.680
and that's why I hurt you.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.920
If there's any way to make amends,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.380
even at the cost of my life,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.110
I am willing.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.410
It seems I've underestimated you before.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.030
With a father like you,

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.840
no wonder Li

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.100
called me a bad person.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.060
I didn't teach her that.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.640
Now is not the time for this.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.400
I need to get to
the County Office quickly.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.730
The fact that you're in my courtyard now,

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:17.360
don't you understand

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.690
what's really going on?

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.840
Based on my book collecting experience,

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.320
Bai Yingsheng's Song Dynasty edition

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.520
is the authentic one.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.940
Good that you've admitted it.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.480
What's going on here?

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.760
What does this mean?

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.150
What does she mean by that?

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.680
Lord Luo,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.640
I wish to file charges against

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.370
Governor Jiang Yiqian of Linji

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.550
for corruption and perversion of justice,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.810
for his personal gain,

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.210
persecuting the innocent,

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.230
and forcing the Wei family

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.280
to complete ruin.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.670
Nonsense!

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.930
Rong Shanbao,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.430
even though we have had our differences,

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.230
you cannot slander me like this.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.440
I have never accepted

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.640
even a penny in bribes.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.920
I am completely innocent

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.230
as heaven and earth can attest!

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.560
Lord Jiang, you may not have taken bribes,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.290
but you're far from innocent.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.960
The Wei family not only
ran a tea plantation,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.900
but also built
a special tower to store books.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.960
Lord Jiang has repeatedly

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.000
borrowed from the Wei family

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.920
precious manuscripts for printing.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.280
However, "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.360
is the Wei family'
most treasured possession.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.150
Lord Jiang requested
to borrow it 3 times

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.780
and was politely refused each time.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.770
You were humiliated by the Wei family

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.960
and have harbored resentment toward them.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.190
That's why you arbitrarily ruled that

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.650
Wei Kejian was a murderer.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.570
When the Wei family continued to appeal,

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.280
you covered up your wrong judgment

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.900
by pressuring officials
to sentence the Wei family to death.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.500
Any officials who disobeyed

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.070
were thrown into prison.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.510
You also chose to ignore the fact

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.840
that Xu Song passed
a male corpse off as female

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.690
and and murdered witnesses

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.670
to silence them.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.470
Even after the case was solved,

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.320
you still refused to spare Madam Yang.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.580
You're slandering me!

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.110
These are all baseless accusations!

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.970
It's all false!

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.150
Lord Jiang, just now you

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.110
admitted with your own mouth

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.370
that this Song Dynasty edition
is authentic.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.620
You personally gave this to Bai Yingsheng,

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.280
which serves as
self-incriminating evidence.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.640
My Lord,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.710
forgive me for my deception earlier.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.570
This copy of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.010
was indeed given
to me by Lord Jiang Yiqian,

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.990
who instructed me
to implicate Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.480
Before this,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.400
I had been staying
at the Provincial Governor's Office

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.060
actually to

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.670
collect evidence of Jiang Yiqian's crimes.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.280
You're all in this together!

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.490
You're trying to frame me!

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.930
You're the murderers!

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.600
You are the ones
truly guilty of grave crimes!

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.270
What's going on?

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.950
Don't be afraid.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.770
Everyone, please don't be afraid.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.330
I am but a humble performer

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.100
skilled in the art of holding my breath
and feigning death.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.310
Rong Shanbao.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.320
What's going on?

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:52.630
My Lord,

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.360
I heard from Madam Yang

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.700
about the existence
of "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku".

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.480
I later learned

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.670
that Lord Jiang
once requested it but was refused.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.790
So when I discovered
this book was missing,

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.990
I became suspicious.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.920
That's why I sent Bai Yingsheng

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.110
to Lord Jiang's side

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.570
to investigate the truth.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.400
While searching for this book,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.550
I learned from

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.610
an elderly clerk at the County Office

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.440
about the feud
between Jiang Yiqian and Wei Kejian.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.300
I just lacked concrete evidence.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.860
I knew Jiang Yiqian is narrow-minded

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.510
and has long seen me
as a thorn in his side.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.040
That's why I set up this trap

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.510
to make Jiang Yiqian
produce evidence of his own crimes.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.190
Now

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.590
we have both witness
and physical evidence.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.580
Lord Luo, I request Your Lordship
thoroughly investigate

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.010
and arrest the true culprit

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.750
to avoid wronging innocent families

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.150
and perverting justice.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.960
Jiang Yiqian has been
reckless in his actions

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.760
and brought harm to this region.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.260
Guards!

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.070
Take him away!

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.480
My Lord, this is unjust!

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.630
My Lord!

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.710
Lord Luo, I've been wronged!

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.180
Lord Luo, this is unjust!

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.550
Lord Luo!

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.110
Lord Luo!

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:12.280
Rong Shanbao.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.510
Although this case has hidden aspects,

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.230
your fabrication of a murder case

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.960
and mockery of this court
is also disrespectful.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.360
I beg Your Lordship
to dismiss all those not involved.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.960
I have something to tell you.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.170
Everyone, withdraw!

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:34.920
All of you, go back.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.630
That's enough.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.360
Disperse now.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.560
Go back. Hurry along.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.760
Lord Lu.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.840
Miss Rong.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.970
What do you wish to tell me?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.710
My Lord,

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.620
my gift to the Empress Dowager

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.590
is not merely

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.670
this precious
Song Dynasty book collection,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.470
but the case behind these books.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.370
Clean officials bring peace;
corrupt officials bring suffering.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.020
The Empress Dowager and Emperor
bestow countless blessings,

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.150
yet with great power

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.300
comes both fortune and calamity.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.950
Though I am but a commoner,

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.980
uninvolved in court politics,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.980
I too wish for peace and prosperity.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.530
My true gift

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.800
is to do what little I can

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.380
to remove corrupt officials

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.070
[Impartial Justice]

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.270
and preserve integrity in government.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.630
I have indeed

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.490
underestimated the Rong family.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.850
[Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku]

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.400
Is this book authentic?

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.320
I got this

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.030
from Wei Kejian before.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.040
It's absolutely authentic.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.760
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.170
[Why is "Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku"
so precious?]

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.000
is a large encyclopedia
from Southern Song Dynasty,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.070
equivalent to today's encyclopedia.

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.400
The book contains

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.360
astronomy, geography,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.320
poetry, health remedies,

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.840
and even food stories.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.630
For example, Su Shi's Dongpo Pork

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.450
might have first appeared here.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.550
It categorizes ancient wisdom

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.150
into over a hundred volumes.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.350
Scholars can cite references from it.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.510
Common people

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.270
can also learn some life hacks.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.550
Unfortunately, most of the original books

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.920
have been lost.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.030
The remaining parts

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.280
have become treasure maps

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.330
for studying ancient culture.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:15.190
Even "Complete Tang Poems"

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.190
relies on it to fill in the gaps.
