00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.950
[Episode 28]

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.360
[Linji Prefectural Office]

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.590
Didn't we agree

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.000
that you'd hold nothing back from me?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.060
Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.930
how many more things
are you still hiding from me?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.280
Shanbao,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.210
I'm really curious

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.870
which one of us

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.590
will end up going farther.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.329
Did you hear our conversation

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.079
just now?

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.710
She was forced into this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.680
She has been looked down upon
since childhood.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.280
Now

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.150
she just wants to secure her footing

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.280
in the Rong Mansion.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.680
Mr. Bai, do you dare
to make a bet with me?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.190
If she's willing to give up the wealth

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.650
of the Rong family for you,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.520
then it proves

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.320
she's not completely ruthless,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.220
and I will let bygones be bygones.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.640
But if she abandons you,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.700
then you shall work for me.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.010
What do you say?

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.430
We have a message from Lady Yunxi.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.150
It says that Jiang Yiqian has captured Li

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.550
and is forcing Lady Yunxi
to do his bidding.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.360
Tell her

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.950
to follow Jiang Yiqian's orders.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.580
Yes.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.250
Have you lost your mind?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.400
You even dared to burn the Tea King Tree?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.240
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.840
Only in this way can we make Jiang Yiqian

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.570
let down his guard completely.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.960
Fine.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.400
I've been running around,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.470
working tirelessly for you.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.680
But in the end, you won't even give me

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.940
a single word of truth.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.310
Rong Shanbao, to you,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.000
am I just a tool to be summoned

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.260
and dismissed at will?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.770
Jiang Yiqian is your sworn enemy.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.320
By eliminating him,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.980
wasn't I also helping you?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.320
What on earth are you even angry about?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.710
Fine, I'm being unreasonable.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.990
I shouldn't have worried
that you would get bullied by your sisters

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.630
when you returned to the mansion.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.079
I shouldn't have worried
that Luo Deze would hold you accountable

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.740
for the ruined birthday gift.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.870
And I certainly shouldn't have worried
that getting entangled in a murder case

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.470
would ruin your reputation.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.740
Stop the carriage!

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.240
My Lord, are you getting out?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.780
Are you still getting out?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.190
No, I'm not.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.770
When this case is over,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.630
I will give you an explanation.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.920
Good.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.470
I'll wait.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.330
Fragrant pouches and sachets!

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.040
So you actually colluded with Rong Shanbao

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.160
to deceive me!

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.520
What a loyal servant indeed!

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.560
Since you've chosen
to work for Rong Shanbao,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.310
why put on this mask of mercy?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.590
Yes, I deceived you.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.270
But Yunshu,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.680
you have

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.630
gone astray.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.950
Astray?

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.870
In this vast Rong Mansion,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.000
when Grandmother held Rong Shanbao up

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.159
as the shining moon,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.159
did she ever stop to think

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.090
there was still a weed clinging to life
in the corner?

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.530
If I don't fight,
should I just wait for her charity?

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.390
I must fight!

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.190
I fight, whatever the cost!

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.720
I fight, until the very end!

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.530
I thought you would understand me.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.340
But why would even you stand in my way?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.750
Why would even you think

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.030
I should admit guilt?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.190
Leave. I don't want to see you anymore.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.070
The day I fell into the river,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.670
the water, steeped in hatred,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.940
surged into my lungs.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.950
When I awoke, I swore

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.430
that I myself would shackle

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.270
the hands
that had pushed me into the river.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.040
Then you can do it now.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.830
Yet even now, I still cherish the memory

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.490
of the quiet orchid fragrance

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.720
on the sunny day we first met.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.010
I'm about to go to the capital
for the imperial exam.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.750
This will likely be

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.480
the last time we see each other.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.040
Grandmother, it's time
to take your medicine.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.190
Set it down for now.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.360
What the hell are you doing?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.500
Let me tell you the truth.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.120
My eyes have been healed for a long time.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.600
All these years of biding my time

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.800
were only to seek justice for my mother.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.669
Grandmother,
you must take your medicine obediently

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.789
and stay alive

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.440
to see with your own eyes

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.630
that a maid's child

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.080
will inherit the Rong family,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.140
and that my mother's memorial tablet

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.320
will be rightfully

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.650
placed in the Rong family ancestral hall.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.200
Drink! I'm telling you to drink!

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.740
Mr. Yan.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.550
Why are you being so rude?

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.410
Old Madam Rong,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.020
wake up!

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.140
Old Madam Rong!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.510
-How dare you break into Chongxi Hall!
-Old Madam Rong!

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.510
Someone come at once!

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.110
Throw this insolent man out!

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.390
Yes, someone should be called here

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.440
to examine exactly
what is in this medicine!

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.120
Mr. Yan,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.120
I show you respect

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.840
because you're an honored guest
invited by Grandmother,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.200
but you have no right to spout nonsense

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.320
and falsely accuse me!

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.000
Please go back to pack your things now

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.400
and leave the Rong Mansion immediately.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.130
Lady Yunshu,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.000
Mr. Bai has cherished you deeply.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.550
He once earnestly advised you

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.880
to leave this den of intrigue.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.100
But you were filled with hatred,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.910
trapped in the mire
and refusing to free yourself.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.910
Even now, you still show no remorse.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.360
Do you truly not fear karmic retribution?

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.560
How did you know that?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.120
This is a private matter
of our Rong family.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.750
An outsider

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.480
like you has no right to butt in.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.730
Mr. Yan is indeed an outsider.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.060
As a member of the Rong family,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.520
I can intervene, can't I?

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.470
Lady Shanbao,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.290
you've returned.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.510
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.790
I'll take care of the Rong family's

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.820
private matters.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.750
Yunshu.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.270
I've properly resolved the matter
of the birthday gift.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.670
Now that things have come to this,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.840
it is time to settle accounts with you
properly.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.370
Your most unforgivable act

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.720
was confining

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.630
our sick grandmother

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.660
to control the entire family.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480
This is the deepest filial impiety.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.390
What right do you have

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.390
to lecture me?

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.890
Let's not forget

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.600
that now you're still just a granddaughter

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.360
who has been expelled

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.000
from the Rong Mansion by Grandmother.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.600
Guards.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.680
Guards!

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.750
These two

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.600
are disturbing Grandmother's rest.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.870
Throw both of them out!

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.770
Have you forgotten what Grandmother said?

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.700
While she's ill,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.360
I am in charge of all the affairs
of the Rong family.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.390
Are you all deaf?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.360
Throw them out now!

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.630
Otherwise, when Grandmother wakes up,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.490
every one of you will be punished.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.630
Rong Yunshu.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.080
Yang Yitang

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.540
has already turned you in.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.750
You conspired with him
to bring trouble into our family,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.350
which made Grandmother ill.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.910
Now, Jiang Yiqian, the man behind him,

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.200
has also been arrested.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.200
If you are still so stubborn
and refuse to repent,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.030
I'll have the constables take you away

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.690
and interrogate you in court.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.120
I'm stubborn?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.550
She was the one
who was stuck in outdated ways

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.480
and brought untold harm to others.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.030
She was the one
who was obsessed with social standing

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.630
and treated my birth mother as someone

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.960
to be trampled on by all.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.030
She was

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.750
the one who watched

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.840
her own son

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.910
die of grief,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.840
forbade him to be buried
in the family graveyard,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.630
and even barred me from paying homage
to my own parents.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.840
To outsiders,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.150
she is the respectable head

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.210
of the Rong family,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.670
helping the distressed
and doing good far and wide.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.530
But to members of the Rong family,

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.080
she's nothing but a tyrant!

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.720
Rong Shanbao, you were only 13

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.630
when she forced you

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.240
to join the tea caravan
on its trade routes,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.440
nearly causing you to die far from home.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.750
No matter how much you sacrificed
for the Rong family,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.600
the moment you showed
the slightest disobedience,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.480
you became a traitor to the Rong family,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.510
stripped of everything

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.150
and expelled from the Rong family.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.880
Is that fair?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.950
You all accuse me of wanting to harm her.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.720
But why would I need to lift a finger?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.630
The state she's in now

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.840
is Heaven's punishment for her.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.150
Heaven is punishing

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.740
this overbearing old tyrant,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.440
leaving her hands paralyzed,
her voice silenced,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.910
her kin estranged
and her possessions stripped away!

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.750
Your father truly loved your mother.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.790
They were indeed a rare loving couple.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.360
But for his personal desires,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.720
your father abandoned
the entire tea caravan.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.550
The entire tea shipment
was looted by desert bandits.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.440
More than 10 people died
or were injured.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.270
If I had been the head of the Rong family,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.030
I would also have needed
to give the tea farmers an explanation.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.150
In her position,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.060
Grandmother faced many difficult choices.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.000
When I was lost in the desert,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.000
so thirsty that I nearly

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.840
had to drink my own blood to save myself,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.970
I did blame her once.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.270
But had I been in her position,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.530
I, too, might have been

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.390
forced to do certain things.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720
Isn't that right,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.430
Grandmother?

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.680
I'm not as magnanimous as you are.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.030
Now that I cannot

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.830
seek justice for my poor mother,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.080
what joy is there in living?

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.360
Better to just end it all.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.000
Mr. Yan.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.400
I...

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.710
I didn't mean to do it.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.760
He threw himself onto the blade.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.500
Take Lady Yunshu away at once.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.490
Lady Yunshu.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.850
Mr. Yan!

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.660
Lady Shanbao,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.960
thank goodness you're alright.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.150
Mr. Yan!

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Well, well,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.960
you work here
but secretly serve someone else.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.030
You've become a spy

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.120
for Lady Shanbao, haven't you?

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.750
Spare me, sir!

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.670
I wouldn't dare!

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.310
I would never dare to do such a thing!

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.790
I ordered you to seal off the riverbank

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.440
and spare no effort in the rescue.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.390
You told me you couldn't

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.860
find any trace of Bai Yingsheng.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.360
Yet he conspired with Lady Rong Shanbao

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.880
and snuck
into the Provincial Governor's Office.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.070
Jun Dai, oh Jun Dai.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.880
How remarkably well you kept this from me.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840
Lady Shanbao said

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.510
Mr. Bai was reserved for other purposes

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.550
and couldn't be handed over
to the authorities.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.720
Please don't be angry, My Lord.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.520
I am completely loyal to you, My Lord.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.120
It's just that my parents and sister

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.510
still work for the Rong family.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.510
Their fate

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.720
rests entirely in the hands
of Lady Shanbao.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.120
But I dare swear to Heaven

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.360
that apart from saving lives
for good karma,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.030
there is not a single thing

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.760
I have hidden from you, My Lord.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.420
Do you dare swear to Heaven

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.240
that you haven't hidden anything else
from me?

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.480
My Lord, you've said before

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.210
that my loyalty to Lady Shanbao

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.960
is loyalty to you.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.200
It seems that Rong Shanbao

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.770
is still keeping far too many things
from me.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.570
Take him away.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Give him 10 lashes
before bringing him back for questioning.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.600
No, no!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.440
Please don't!

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.860
My Lord, I'll tell you.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.780
I'll tell you everything!

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:11.550
Speak.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.960
As long as it's about Rong Shanbao,

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.270
you must not leave a single word out.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.270
Old Madam Rong's illness

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.360
started from her ankles,

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.790
gradually spreading upward to the knees.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.270
Within a month or two, it spread
to the thigh bones.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.530
Then it moved to the shoulders and elbows

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.850
before finally reaching the hands.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.420
It started with numbness and itching.
Then it felt like insects gnawing,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.510
with the pain worsening through the night.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.720
Since the illness didn't develop
overnight,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.870
it cannot be cured in a month or two.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.360
Doctor, your words are indeed strange.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.200
Grandmother has always been
in good health.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.430
She had a stroke
because she was frightened by bandits.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.550
But according to your words,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.410
it sounds like a chronic illness.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.600
If Grandmother had truly been ill,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.800
how could she have shown no signs at all?

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.310
Yunxi, did you know of this?

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.369
So your prescription...

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.160
The prescription from Dr. Sun earlier

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.040
primarily targets
excessive internal heat.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.400
It is effective to some extent.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.030
But Old Madam Rong's illness

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.110
is caused by chronic arthralgia.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.050
She ought to take
the Life-Prolonging Decoction instead,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.880
which will surely work
after just one dose.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.230
Can it really be that miraculous?

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.810
Grandmother, you're awake!

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.480
-Grandmother, are you alright?
-Old Madam Rong.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.280
You're awake.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.590
-Grandmother.
-Grandmother.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.720
How are you feeling?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.440
Hurry.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.030
The moment Grandmother woke up,

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.310
she kept asking to see you.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.070
Hurry up.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.090
Don't panic.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.510
You stay at Xinfang Pavilion.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.640
If Mr. Yan wakes up,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.320
come report to me at once.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.040
Let's go.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.750
Grandmother, are you feeling better?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.030
You've suffered a lot.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.240
Grandmother, if you're no longer angry
with me,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.170
I don't feel it's suffering at all.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.070
Where is she?

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.440
She is confined in the small courtyard
behind the ancestral hall.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.970
Once you've fully recovered,
you can deal with her personally.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.750
How is Bailou doing with his injuries?

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.150
According to the doctor,

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.380
Mr. Yan's injuries are severe,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.880
and his life is in danger.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.690
Whether he can pull through

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.920
depends on how he fares
these next two days.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.830
I was thinking

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.350
we should send someone
to inform the Yan family immediately,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.960
but I feared the journey would be too far

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960
to make it in time.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.010
Fortune favors the virtuous.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.990
He is a fine young man,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.240
even sacrificing himself to save you.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.960
When you weren't at the Rong Mansion,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.350
he still spoke well of you to me

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.480
every single day.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.290
It was all because of him

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.350
that you and I could finally reconcile.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.530
He is truly a blessing to our Rong family.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.770
There are people attending to me here.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.640
You need not stay by my side.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.370
Go to Xinfang Pavilion

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.750
and make sure his life is saved.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.850
Okay.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.270
I'll go watch over him
at Xinfang Pavilion right away.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.030
Grandmother, your illness
has only just taken a turn for the better.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.790
You must not exhaust yourself
with worries.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.270
Let me help you lie down first.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.880
No.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.960
Go tell Bailou

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.020
that if he pulls through,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.790
I'll

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400
grant him a wish.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.680
A wish?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.040
A wish that he has long kept hidden

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.130
in his heart

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.040
and has been too hesitant
to ever speak aloud.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.210
As long as he survives,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.720
I will make it come true for him.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.350
[Prison]

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.960
I have urgent business
to discuss with Lord Luo.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.490
Go tell him I need to see him!

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.920
Someone come at once!

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.290
I demand to see Lord Luo!

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.000
Lord Jiang,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.590
you're making such a fuss
to see the Imperial Inspector.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.590
What exactly do you need to report?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.310
Through the ages,

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.310
the cycle of rise and fall never ends.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.550
Young man,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.590
never burn all your bridges.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.350
Do not celebrate your victory too soon.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.070
Lord Jiang,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.000
you yourself handed over

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.350
Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.470
For a single set of books,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.400
you persisted in targeting Madam Yang
even after she had left

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.260
the Wei family.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.580
Now the witness has confessed.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.420
What excuses do you have left?

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.180
Shut up!

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.720
I did nothing wrong!

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.590
Wei Kejian was the real murderer!

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.110
The verdict
was not a miscarriage of justice!

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.270
Madam Yang was nothing but a prostitute

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.310
the Weis hired!

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.510
You and Rong Shanbao

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.640
are conspiring together

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
to frame me!

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.350
I want to see the Emperor!

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.320
I want to appeal for justice!

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.720
I want to see the Emperor!

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.090
My Lord, Miss Xu requests an audience.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.400
Miss Xu?

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.160
Xu Meiying?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.390
Lu Jianglai,
you are far from blameless yourself.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.030
To serve your own selfish ends,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.880
you pinned Madam Yang's death

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.830
on me!

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.590
You and those despicable people

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.880
are birds of a feather!

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.200
Lu Jianglai!

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.490
Guards! Let me out!

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.980
On his way back to the capital,
Minister Xu

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.350
was seized by a sudden recurrence
of his old ailment and lost consciousness.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.270
The boat made an emergency stop
at Songzhou,

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.510
but before a doctor
could be summoned to treat him,

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.440
Minister Xu had passed away,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.510
his pulses ceasing entirely.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.720
Miss Xu is escorting his coffin
back to his hometown.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.780
She is here to inform you of his death.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.900
When you retire
and return to your hometown,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.110
your boat will still pass through Linji.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.840
At that time,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.980
I will bring the finest Longjing tea

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.910
and wait for you at the dock.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.830
Senior Lu, the Xu family
is not a big family,

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.000
and I am my father's only daughter.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.240
If I go back alone,
I might be bullied by my relatives.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.900
On his deathbed, my father

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.560
told me to seek help from you.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.550
Senior Lu, I beg you,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.680
for the sake of the old bonds
between my father and you...

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.640
Please, don't!

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.200
Please sit down.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960
I'll never forget

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.650
the kindness
your father bestowed on me.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.480
I will ensure
his funeral is handled properly.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.720
Have several quiet rooms

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720
prepared at once.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.070
And make sure
the Xu family is well settled.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.680
Yes.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.600
Junior Xu.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.160
You must not let grief ravage your health.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.270
Your own well-being must still come first.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.930
I see that you don't look well.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.030
Go and rest in the rear quarters first.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.360
All other matters can be discussed later.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.830
Jun Dai.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.960
Miss Xu, please.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.030
Senior Lu, forgive me

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.750
for losing control of my emotions.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.810
I didn't bring many servants with me.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.330
Three or four rooms will be enough.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.310
But on my way here,

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.710
I came across a beggar
on the brink of death.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.650
I felt compassion for him,

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.350
so I brought him along.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.260
I'm sorry for causing you undue trouble.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.640
He is gravely ill.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.110
Senior Lu, please

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.400
find a doctor for him.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.480
What kind

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.280
of deep hatred

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.510
could drive someone to do

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.410
something so cruel to another?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.740
His limbs were ruined,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.680
his voice silenced, his sight lost.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.680
Yet he desperately tried

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.410
to crawl all the way into Linji.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.640
He was being teased
by a group of children.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640
I took pity on him,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.880
so I brought him with me.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.440
Get a doctor for him.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.590
Yes.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.500
Why don't you go in?

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.690
She said, "I thought
you would understand me.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.440
But why would even you stand in my way?

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.790
Why would even you think

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.200
I should admit guilt?"

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.240
Lady Shanbao.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.310
Was I wrong?

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.640
You two are

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.670
quite a pair.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.240
There's something I need to tell you.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.000
Grandmother hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.480
How could you bring her here
while she's still so weak?

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.830
-You...
-It was I who insisted they carry me here.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.830
Don't blame them.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.880
Grandmother, please go back.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.740
I'll stay here and watch over him.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.620
Do you think

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.240
I'm overly concerned about Bailou?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.590
You know

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.790
that the Yan family once sent a man

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.920
to our Rong Mansion.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.610
He was Bailou's grand-uncle.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.960
He was the ninth son of the Yan family,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.360
so everyone called him Ninth Young Master.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.330
Though he was handsome,

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.400
he was too gentle and too reserved.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.680
He was truly not much to my liking.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.350
I seldom visited his quarters.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.270
But in the end,

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.590
he gave his own life

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.830
to save mine.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.060
I didn't know this.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.330
Grandmother,
you never mentioned this before.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400
It was a long time ago.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.870
That year, he accompanied me
on the tea caravan route.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.750
When I got trapped in the quicksand,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.400
I thought that was the end of my life.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.370
I never imagined

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.740
that he would risk his own life
to save me.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.510
When I saw Bailou that day,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.610
I felt somewhat disappointed,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.760
because the two of them
didn't look much alike.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.450
It wasn't until I saw Bailou

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.720
step forward to shield you from the blade

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.250
that I suddenly understood

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.170
the two of them were the same

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.720
in at least one aspect.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.770
The men of the Yan family

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.410
are ready to lay down their lives

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.120
for the women they love.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.770
Fortunately, there are

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.060
two renowned doctors, Dr. Hou and Dr. Sun,
in our mansion.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.900
Dr. Sun

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.240
is especially skilled at treating wounds.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240
He will surely spare no effort

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.500
to save Mr. Yan's life.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.000
Please don't be too distressed.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.510
The Rong and Yan families have been bound
by marriage for generations,

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.680
maintaining a long-standing alliance.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.960
Now, the Yan family is thriving

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.000
in the Shu region.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.310
Last year,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.480
they shipped 20,000 bales of tea

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.310
via the Guanmaosong Ancient Road.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.310
They sent their son

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.440
to our Rong family.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.130
Their intention to strengthen the alliance
is obvious.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.750
I also intend to open up

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.000
a new tea trade route for our family.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.720
As long as Bailou

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.390
pulls through,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.240
you two shall marry.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.350
My mind is made up.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.550
Fushan Temple is really well-known
for making wishes come true.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.150
Tomorrow,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.390
go draw a fortune stick for Bailou.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.230
Yes.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.870
[Fushan Temple]

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.220
Slow down.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.160
In his later years, my father devoted
himself to Buddhist practice,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.620
often visiting temples
to listen to sutras.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.070
Fushan Temple is the most eminent
monastery in Jiangnan,

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.330
holding scripture lectures each month.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720
I intend to place

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.690
a memorial tablet here in his honor,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.420
fulfilling his lifelong wish.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.350
However, the abbot, Master Xuhui,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.710
is a revered monk of our time.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.110
It's not easy to meet him.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.400
So I have to trouble you to take time out

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.830
of your busy schedule to accompany me.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.230
There is no need for such formality
between us.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.490
The kindness Minister Xu bestowed on me
was immeasurable.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.770
Even if I were to sacrifice myself,
I couldn't repay a fraction of it.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.700
Being able to do something for him now
is a privilege.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.150
I don't deserve such thanks.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.640
This is what Grandmother

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640
wanted me to see?

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:04.110
Lady Shanbao.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.000
That Miss Xu

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.350
was Minister Xu's beloved daughter.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.350
After Minister Xu passed away,

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.160
she came to seek refuge with Lord Lu.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.000
She was settled in the rear quarters
of the Government Office.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.030
These days,
word has spread all over the city.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.550
♪ The biting cold wind
makes me stumble as I run ♪

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.310
They say...

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.570

♪ Laughing innocently,

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.110

with an excellent reputation
as an official

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.220

♪ Just like this,
I'm lost in enduring hardships ♪

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.110
Yet Lord Lu has remained unmoved,

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.520
turning every single one of them down
politely.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.720
♪ Intertwined with you ♪

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.680

♪ No longer fret over who loves more ♪

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.160

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.200
Senior Lu.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:02.740
[Rong Mansion]

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.540
That oath-breaking scoundrel!

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.250
You not only saved his life,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.920
but also defied Grandmother

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.270
and gave up
the Rong family's vast fortune for him.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.830
If he had even a shred of conscience,

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.920
he ought to lay down his life

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.160
to repay your kindness.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.160
Yet he openly walked arm in arm
with another woman,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.560
clearly having an affair behind your back.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.750
He's unfaithful and shameless!

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.710
Why did you come back?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.510
You should tear off his hypocritical mask

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.770
and give him the punishment he deserves!

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.190
What nonsense are you speaking?

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.110
Lord Lu has been appointed
as Prefect of Linji.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.400
He has even brought down Jiang Yiqian

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.090
who has always been domineering.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.990
He clearly has the Emperor's favor

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.320
and a brilliant future.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.710
As long as he treats tea farmers well

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.240
and respects the tea trade,

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.510
our Rong family should not only
avoid offending him

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.910
but also maintain good relations with him.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.190
What kind of talk is this?

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.880
Do you really intend to cast him aside?

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.720
Fine!

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.880
Then let him pursue his political career.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.480
You focus on being the Tea King.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.200
A disloyal man like him

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.790
is not worthy of being your husband.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.190
A clean break is the best.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.000
It prevents future trouble

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.260
that would bring disgrace to our family.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.360
Lady Shanbao, my young master
has woken up.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.270
I've made you worry about me,
Old Madam Rong.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.750
How can I possibly be at ease?

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.150
Do not stand on ceremony.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.100
From now on, don't call me Old Madam Rong.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.350
Just call me Grandmother.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.400
Since I came to Linji,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.640
Old Madam Rong, you have shown me
such care and kindness,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.470
which makes it only right

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.780
to call you Grandmother.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:09.690
Young Master.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.429
Young Master, please stop talking now.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.820
It is all right.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.150
I'm not that delicate.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.150
It's merely a superficial wound.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.590
I'll recover soon.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.060
Bailou.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.630
You've been with our Rong family
for so long now.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:26.800
I have watched

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.030
your every word and action closely.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.320
You are gentle and refined,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.030
and your conduct
is always measured and proper.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.630
Though many young men
came to the Rong Mansion,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.960
but only you

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.870
have remained free from strife,

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.730
open-hearted and upright,

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.639
without a trace of resentment or envy.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.000
You truly have

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.760
a remarkable character.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.670
I have been testing you
for quite some time.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.880
Only you can shoulder
such great responsibility

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.550
and are worthy
of marrying our Rong family's

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.840
future head.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.320
Bao.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.070
Shanbao.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.360
Don't forget

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.920
what you've promised me.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.360
Mr. Yan, Grandmother is right.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.360
You need to recover soon

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.660
so that our Rong family can prepare
for the wedding.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.030
The case about Jiang Yiqian

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.550
has been sent to the Ministry of Justice.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.030
With Imperial Inspector Luo's testimony,

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.690
the charges are irrefutable.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.550
Those wrongfully imprisoned magistrates

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.810
will be released soon.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.150
Everyone praises your righteous courage

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.350
and decisive action.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.760
You should be happy.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.410
Why do you wear such a worried look?

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.220
There's still one case

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.040
that remains unsolved.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.480
Yang Yitang has been interrogated
repeatedly.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.590
If he did not commit the murder
out of hatred,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.990
then who drove Madam Yang

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.440
to her death?

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:21.640
I thought

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.460
you were troubled due to Miss Xu.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.680
Haven't you noticed it?

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.760
Noticed what?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.280
Have some tea.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.190
Though the Xu family is small,

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.840
Minister Xu was an upright official

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.110
and deeply revered by local people.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.370
When Miss Xu goes back,

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.380
there surely will be people
she can rely on.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.040
Minister Xu

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.550
asked his beloved daughter to come to you.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.960
He clearly intended
to betroth his daughter to you.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.110
Miss Xu is beautiful and intelligent,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.480
skilled in both calligraphy and painting.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.510
Though from a noble family, she's humble,

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.510
gentle and well-mannered.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:59.670
Such a fine woman

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.450
is the dream of countless men.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.650
If she marries you,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.070
she'll surely be a virtuous wife

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.800
and understanding companion.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.800
Someone just loves
to make things difficult for themselves.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.190
Fine, I'll say no more.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.880
Since you don't want to marry her,

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.440
you must make yourself perfectly clear.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.010
Don't leave any room for misunderstanding.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:17.740
I know.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.530
My Lord, Miss Xu requests an audience.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.660
Minister Xu has just passed away.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.160
She is still in the depths of grief.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.450
If you're going to refuse the marriage,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.850
you must do it tactfully.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.730
Don't put the young lady
in an awkward position.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.900
Tell her to come in.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.760
Yes.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.440
Senior Lu, Mr. Lang.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.550
Here's some fresh tea. Take your time.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.150
I'll take my leave now.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.440
No, you stay.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.190
I'd like you to be here while we talk.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.670
Junior Xu,
you've come at the perfect time.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.040
I was just about to look for you.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:07.700
Have a seat.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.190
In the rear quarters,
the clerks, the constables

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.790
and the visitors are all men.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.230
Aside from the old cook in the kitchen,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.630
there is not a single woman here.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.230
Junior Xu,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.240
you are an unmarried young lady.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.190
Staying here would be highly improper

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.810
and would inevitably harm your reputation.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.670
Minister Xu asked me to take care of you.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.840
Then I am like your own brother.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.310
If I fail to do my utmost,

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.840
that will be unforgivable.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.440
If you are unwilling
to return to your hometown,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.970
then I will find you another

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.540
peaceful residence in Linji.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.340
You can move there in three days.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.480
Once your mourning period is over,

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.710
I will find you

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.330
a virtuous and talented

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.480
husband from a family of equal standing.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.010
Only thus
can I live up to Minister Xu's trust.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.630
Senior Lu, I get

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.450
what you're saying.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.480
Please continue your conversation.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.740
I'll take my leave now.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:03.760
Wait.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.800
Senior Lu asked you to stay here.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.710
It's to stop any gossip before it starts.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.840
He doesn't regard you as an outsider,

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.370
so you don't have to be so eager to leave.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640
My father is gone.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.180
And there is no elder in the family
to make decisions for me.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.780
So there are certain matters

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.840
that I can decide for myself.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.710
Senior Lu, since you're willing

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.320
to speak frankly with me,

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.700
then I will also speak plainly.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.320
Some of my words may offend you.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.570
Do you refuse to marry me

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.490
because you intend
to become a live-in son-in-law

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.600
of the Rong family?

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.440
You're really well-informed.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.110
I've heard the talk

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.570
going around the streets.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.560
When my father was alive,
he used to tell me

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.840
that all talented men

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.640
are inevitably arrogant

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.190
and unsociable.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.280
Such people can hardly

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.940
succeed in official circles.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.630
He had many students.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:17.920
But only you, Senior Lu,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.250
were most valued by him,

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.710
because you have
unwavering determination

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.840
and great ambition,

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.400
take on responsibility without flinching
in crisis,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.860
know when to be principled
and when to adapt,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.420
and hold a heart of true benevolence.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440
Given time,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.110
you will surely assist the Emperor

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.790
in achieving national rejuvenation

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:38.650
and ushering in a prosperous era.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.580
Among all the promising talents at court,

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.260
you were the only one

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.880
my father spoke so highly of.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.340
But sometimes my father also worried

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.320
that your early success

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.480
would arouse envy and resentment.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.120
The slightest misstep

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.780
could put your life in peril.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.900
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.370
The Rong family
is a powerful local clan,

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.530
with overwhelming influence.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.070
For others, marrying into the Rong family
as a son-in-law

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.790
would surely be a shortcut
to instant prosperity.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.660
But if you marry Miss Rong,

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.440
people will inevitably criticize

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.400
that you let your personal feelings
cloud your judgment in the Wei case.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.460
More importantly,

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.630
the Emperor trusts you so much.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.580
Sooner or later, you will leave Linji.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.730
For the sake of a single woman,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.320
would you truly be willing
to confine yourself to this tiny corner

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.150
and abandon the grand aspirations
you vowed to pursue

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.210
when you first entered officialdom?

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.400
Miss Xu, you...

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.000
Mr. Lang, Senior Lu,
please don't misunderstand me.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.150
It is true that my father intended

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.010
to entrust my future to Senior Lu.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.170
But a marriage between a man and a woman

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.230
must be blessed by the will of Heaven.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.500
If it's not my destined match,

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.290
I have no desire to force it.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.980
Senior Lu, I said these words,

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.190
only because I don't want to see

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.850
you fail to fulfill your ambitions
in the future

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.360
and regret it for the rest of your life.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.960
Junior Xu, I have already...

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.920
Senior Lu, you should
think it through yourself

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.450
and make your own decision.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.070
However, I came today

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.600
for another urgent matter.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.230
It's about the beggar

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.160
who came with me.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.710
What's wrong with that beggar?

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.370
Please follow me, both of you.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.510
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.400
-Young Master!
-Young Master!

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.110
What's wrong?

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.360
Young Master, what's wrong?

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.280
-Please get up, Young Master!
-Young Master!

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.080
Young Master!

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.110
My Lord.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.520
Help him up quickly.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.200
Yes.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.260
Come on, Young Master.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.370
Young Master.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.190
I can see
that you originally had a handsome face

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.250
and noble bearing.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.710
You don't seem like an ordinary beggar.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.560
I am Lu Jianglai, the Prefect of Linji.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.920
If you have suffered an injustice,

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.450
you can tell me everything.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.230
There's no hurry.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.870
Can you write?

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.010
Bring paper and brush.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:09.570
Yes.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.550
But his tendons in both hands and feet
have been severed.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.010
How can he possibly write?

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.070
He can hold the brush with his mouth.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.950
We must at least give it a try.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.290
That makes sense.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.260
What is he writing?

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.920
It's completely illegible.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:59.550
Take your time.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.630
Don't rush.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.060
Stay calm.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.870
I know you have grievances to express.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.630
However, even 3 years may not be enough
for a child to learn to write well.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.960
You're using your mouth
instead of your hands.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.360
That must be much harder.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.090
Take your time.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.440
You can practice it slowly.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.360
I'll wait here

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.830
until you make it.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.900
Lord Lu's word is his bond.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.400
He never breaks his promise.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.200
Rest assured.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.110
I know

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.840
that you've suffered greatly,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.860
carrying immense bitterness in your heart.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:41.870
Write it down.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.100
Only by writing it down

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.490
can Lord Lu begin to seek justice for you.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.220
[The Evolution Theory of Tea Culture]

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:49.690
Here's some fresh tea. Take your time.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.220
I'll take my leave now.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.550
No, you stay.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.360
I'd like you to be here while we talk.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.110
Chinese tea culture has a history
spanning thousands of years.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.230
[Tea has become
an essential part of daily life]

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.880
According to legend, Shennong
discovered tea leaves

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.400
while sampling hundreds of herbs.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.360
Gu Yanwu deduced

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.110
that after the Qin Dynasty unified China,
the custom of tea drinking

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.510
spread beyond the Bashu region

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:07.740
and entered the Central Plains.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.060
By the Wei, Jin,
and Southern-Northern dynasties,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.690
it had evolved into a nationwide practice.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.050
In the Tang Dynasty,
Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.070
completed the framework
of classical tea studies.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.760
Tea became a life art

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.090
for scholars and intellectuals.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.520
The concept of unity between Zen and tea

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.920
began to gain popularity.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.170
In the Song Dynasty, the practices
of diancha and doucha prevailed.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.140
Tea drinking became integrated
with other aspects of daily life,

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.770
its forms and content

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.360
growing more complete and diverse.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.720
The emerging class of scholars

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.850
played a vital role in this evolution.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.000
During the Ming and Qing dynasties,
loose tea rose to prominence.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.370
The tea brewing method was simplified.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.240
Through maritime trade, tea made its way

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.570
to the rest of the world.

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:38.440
Industrialization in modern times

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.640
gave birth to new forms such as tea bags,

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.320
while the traditional tea ceremony
experienced a revival.

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:46.230
Today,

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.560
tea culture has integrated
concepts of health

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.990
and scientific innovation,

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.180
achieving diverse and global development.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.300
It has transcended

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.780
its role as a practical beverage
to become a cultural symbol

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.190
bridging different times and places,

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:58.430
embodying the thousand-year advancement

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.720
of both material life
and spiritual pursuits.
