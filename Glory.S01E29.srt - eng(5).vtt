00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.910
[Episode 29]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.920
Young Master.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.840
Young Master,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.640
the doctor said

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.920
you must rest in bed.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.509
Be careful not
to tear your wound open again.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.970
Where are you trying to go?

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm fine.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.840
Mr. Yan.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.150
Do you have something urgent

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.480
that you must go out for?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.710
Shixin, you may leave.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.680
Xiu Qiong, you may go too.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.800
Mr. Yan,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.240
what do you have to say to me?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.120
Don't take Lady Rong's words

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.710
to heart.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.360
Our engagement doesn't count anyway.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.870
You don't want to marry me?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.920
I don't.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.770
The Yan family sent you here

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.700
to form a marriage alliance
with our family.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810
Grandmother kept you here for so long

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.710
not only to assess your character,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.970
but more importantly,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.680
to strengthen the alliance
with your family.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.079
If you don't favor me,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.680
then which young lady

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.340
from our family do you prefer?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.820
I'll speak to Grandmother for you.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.540
No.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.240
I don't.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.910
You deny everything,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.370
so what exactly do you want?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.590
My feelings for you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.690
are clear to Lady Rong.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
Everyone in your family

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.560
can see it clearly.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.960
Could it be that only you

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.620
don't know?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.430
You know.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.560
You've always known.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.579
What are you trying to say?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.500
Why ask when you already know the answer?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.710
You agreed to marry me,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.120
was it because
I risked my life to save you,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.800
or...

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.530
because of Lady Rong's orders?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.760
Don't say anything.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.590
I don't want to know.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.720
Mr. Yan, you're perceptive

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.780
and understand everything.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.760
Some things need not be spoken aloud.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.280
Since you are reluctant,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.120
I'll speak to Grandmother on your behalf.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720
I'm sure she won't force you
against your will.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.530
Rong Shanbao, how can you be so cruel?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.040
Can't you just humor me a little?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.070
If you would just tell me

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
that you accept me

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.390
not because of

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.870
the alliance between our families,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.560
nor because of

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.820
Lady Rong's pressure,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.950
but because I've touched your heart

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.000
and you're willing to give me a chance,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.640
that would make me happy.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.610
Lady Rong was actually wrong.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.700
I'm not that magnanimous,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.180
nor am I that tolerant.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.159
From the first moment I saw you,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.630
I fell for you,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.030
wanting to be the master
of the Rong family.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.840
But I know who you truly care for.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.800
I've known from the beginning.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.060
You're so cold and aloof

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.430
to everyone else,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.120
only treating him differently.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.690
But he's calculating and ambitious.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.870
His sincerity

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.920
is always mixed with ulterior motives.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.480
He has designs on you,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.360
but I don't.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.860
I don't ask for your love,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.430
nor your pity.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.730
I only wish for your happiness.

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.070
But he ultimately failed you.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.010
He doesn't deserve you.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.570
He's not worthy of you.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.720
Yes.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.070
Lu Jianglai kept things from me.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.130
What about you, Mr. Yan?

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.520
Have you ever deceived me about anything?

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.560
No.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.920
Not a single thing.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.950
I understand now.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.560
You don't want
to break off our engagement—

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.290
you're asking me for a promise.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.360
Yes.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.360
I want you to say

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.600
that after we're married,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.930
you won't see him again.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.050
Even if you do see him,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.500
you won't acknowledge him.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.360
After we're married?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.680
Say it.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.290
Lie down first.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.710
I'll call the doctor.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.720
I want you to say

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.640
that you promise me.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.960
It's not like...

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.250
I have a choice.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.610
A marriage arranged by Grandmother—

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.690
if I dare to refuse,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.960
she'll just cast me out
of the family again.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.120
Shixin.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.430
Lady Shanbao.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.510
Send for Dr. Sun.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.320
I understand.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.650
It's just there are some things

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.520
I still need to clarify with him.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.800
Alright.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.140
Stay with me a little longer.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.160
Lady Yunxi.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.000
Yunxi,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.070
I heard

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
you want to keep him at Rong Mansion.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.440
Yes, Grandmother.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.299
Nonsense!

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.480
I can tolerate Li only because

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.169
she carries Rong blood.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.600
What is he anyway?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.730
He'll just tarnish
our family's reputation.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.440
Yunxi,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.620
you're

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.440
disappointing me more and more.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.480
Lady Rong.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.240
Grandmother,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.200
what I feared most since childhood

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.060
was hearing you say
the word "disappoint."

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.810
Because of it,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.270
I practiced tea arts relentlessly

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.390
through freezing winters
and scorching summers,

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.520
never daring to slack off for a moment.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.870
Because of it,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.960
I let two people who truly cared for me

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.800
live in hiding,
concealing their identities,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.870
just so I could become

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.670
a worthy whetstone in your eyes.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.870
In your eyes,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.550
only the power of the Rong family matters,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.810
and you've tried to mold us all into that.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.630
I've obediently followed your words
for over a decade,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.200
and only now dare I ask,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.320
is this right?

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.390
Well!

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.710
For the sake of a man,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.600
you dare talk back
to your own grandmother!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.670
Have all the filial piety and rules
you've learned

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.320
been thrown to the winds?

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.750
Li is only three years old,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.550
yet she can tell right from wrong,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.240
and knows family matters most.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.270
An Cha, despite being physically weak,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.720
managed to escort Li back

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
from the Provincial Governor's Office

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.030
on his own.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.750
Grandmother, I used to listen to you

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.600
to fight for power.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.390
But in the end,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.910
I found myself with nothing

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.000
by my side.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.600
You've used me

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.390
for so many years,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.550
yet you never truly cared about

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.840
what I like or what I'm good at.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.390
Now,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.230
it's time to let go
and allow me to make my own choice.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.710
You...

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.750
Get up.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.630
Rong Yunxi!

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200
Think carefully.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.300
If you dare keep him here,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.600
you'll never get a share

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.980
of the Rong family's
tea plantations and shops.

Do we hang one here too?

Yes.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.240
Hang one here as well.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.720
Okay.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.490
Why bring soil from down the mountain?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.480
The elevation here is too high,

This summer's constant heavy rains

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.670
have loosened the tea tree roots.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.320
Replacing it with better soil from below

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.720
will help the tea trees
secure their roots.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.240
You said that once the case was settled,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.770
you would give me an answer.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.150
I've waited for you all this time,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.480

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.330
So you already know.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.150

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.440

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.360

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.000
who'd know how to pursue benefits
and avoid harm

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.960
when making choices.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.390
-I don't need to…
-You lied to me.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.270
You never intended

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.390
to reconcile with me.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.000
You're going to marry someone else.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.200
Women of the Rong family do not marry out.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.850
Whether you marry out
or take a husband in,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.510
you'll keep him

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.390

Isn't that right?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.600
I'm marrying him

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.790

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.790
entered the Rong family
to investigate the case,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.960

These paired pillars

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.030

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.240
managed to escape.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.240
But he never expected...

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:51.610
Stop!

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.490
Stop!

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.790
Hurry! Over there!

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.090
Stop!

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.310
Just ahead!

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.070
Trying to run? Kill him!

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.680
Wei, don't mind me.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.430
You go first.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.960
You're too kind, Yan.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.440
Hurry!

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.200
You go ahead instead.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.030
Over here!

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.560
Stop!

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.830
Stop!

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.920
I'll make sure

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.630
that even on the road to the underworld,

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.660
he can't speak, can't write,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.970
and can't plead his injustice.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.140
The bandits thought he was dead

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.790
so they threw his body into a ravine.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.070
But it wasn't his time to die.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.400
Despite being crippled,

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.400
he survived.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.610
Thanks to the help of kind people,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.480
he begged his way to Linji.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.920
With just a few scribbles

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.790
and no useful evidence,

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.250
you want to condemn me.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.750
How arbitrary and absurd!

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.080
Lord Lu,

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.580
I've always respected your character

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.300
and treated you with sincerity.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.780
Even if you're jealous

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.920
and deliberately obstructing our marriage,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.480
you shouldn't use

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.810
such despicable means.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.240
Once this spreads,

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.200
it will surely invite ridicule.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.600
What good will that do
for your reputation?

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.989
Grandmother,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.280
I've been in the Rong Mansion

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.440
for quite some time now.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.150
Who I am

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.590
and what my character is like—

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.670
can a stranger

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.090
so easily tarnish that?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.920
I will immediately send someone

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.110
to ride swiftly back to Shu region

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.360
to find members from the Yan family
to verify my identity.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.620
But I cannot tolerate this humiliation.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.780
Please grant me some trust

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.400
and drive out

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.600
all these disrupters
of the wedding ceremony.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.150
Don't let me lose face

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.520
and become a laughingstock.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.840
No need for your pretense.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.670
I've already sent people

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.710
to Guzhou where the Yan family
met with misfortune.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.800
The Yan family home
will naturally be visited.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.130
But the journey is long.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.810
Old Madam, I request you

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.510
to grant me time for verification.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.560
So,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.659
apart from this man's testimony,

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.390
you have no other evidence.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.840
Then do not interrupt

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.500
my granddaughter's wedding.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.510
Bailou, rise.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.370
I believe you.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.620
Young Master, be careful.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.760
Lady Shanbao,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.230
do you really

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.360
believe these lies?

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.280
They're conspiring to frame

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.280
Young Master Yan.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.730
He would even risk his life for you.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.720
Such sincerity is beyond doubt.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.550
Shixin,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.980
how long have you served your master?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.190
Young Master Yan comes from
a renowned tea plantation family

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.190
and has studied tea-making for 20 years.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.590
Yet his personal servant

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.950
doesn't know how to plant tea cuttings.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.780
This doesn't make sense.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.100
I told you not to meddle.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.050
These cuttings need to be planted
at a slant.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800
Although Mr. Yan claims that Shixin

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.900
was a servant he took in along the way,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.360
I became suspicious

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.070
and had someone investigate secretly.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:00.710
It turns out that the servants

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.510
you brought into our Rong family

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.710
are actually not

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.110
from your own household.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.670
Shanbao,

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.630
you doubt me?

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.000
Since I spent years
at the top of Mount Meng

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.150
where servants
weren't allowed in the temple,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.080
I handled everything personally.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.320
I originally had servants from my family,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.800
but they got dysentery
due to the unfamiliar climate

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.260
and were sent back midway.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.590
That's why I hired new servants.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.280
Is this also considered
evidence of a crime?

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.840
Is that so?

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.100
Greetings, Old Madam

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100
and Lady Shanbao.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.440
Weren't you sent to Yinzhou?

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.800
Why have you returned?

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.390
Please forgive me, Old Madam.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.390
Before I left,

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.550
Ms. Yan called for me

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.550
and entrusted me with an important matter.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.740
Tie it tightly.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:02.310
Alright.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.130
Secure the water bag.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.880
Got it.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.810
Make sure it's done properly.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:11.590
Yes.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.650
I never went to Yinzhou.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.280
Instead, I went to
the Yan family in the Shu region

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.940
to verify Mr. Yan's identity.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.030
And I've brought someone back with me.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.960
Old Madam, please take a close look.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.150
This is Yan Xiang

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.360
who has been

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.490
the Yan family's steward for 30 years.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.760
Young Master.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.480
Young Master!

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.110
Young Master!

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.670
Young Master!

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.930
What happened to you?

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.880
Who did this to you?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.280
You...

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.120
Young Master!

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.630
Liar.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.010
So from the very beginning,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.470
you were planning to capture me.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.200
That's right.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.110
I did take over

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.440
Yan Bailou's identity.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.150
But since I came to the Rong Mansion,

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.920
have I wronged you in any way?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.350
How could you treat me like this?

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.840
You're still acting.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.710
You escaped from Linji
and hid your identity,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.710
patiently waiting for
a chance to take revenge.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.280
When you learned that

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.840
the Rong family
was seeking a husband for Lady Shanbao,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.150
you deliberately
approached Yan Bailou mid-journey,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.110
befriended him,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.400
imitated his mannerisms,

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800
intentionally led him to his death,

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.610
and then entered Linji under his name.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.480
Along the way, you took in

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.340
a homeless boy,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.480
renamed him Shixin (means stone heart).

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.670
"Though clothed in rags
and eating plain food,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.400
one may not die of hunger or cold;

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.440
with a heart of stone and bowels of wood,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.510
one vows never forget
loyalty and righteousness."

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.590
Yet what you've never forgotten

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:11.920
is clearly your hatred!

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.000
Yang Dingchen

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.280
died by your hands.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.440
He's hidden it so well.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.710
Indeed.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.590
He Xingming has already
confessed to the murder.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.440
There's no need to fabricate more lies.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.030
When he entered,

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.800
Yang Dingchen
was already having an attack.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.800
The servants said

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.440
Yang Dingchen hadn't suffered

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.760
from asthma for many years.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.070
You must have tampered with

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.160
his incense burner
when no one was watching.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.050
He Xingming

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.480
was just your scapegoat.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.800
Heaven's justice is clear.
Karma never fails.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.590
My Wei family suffered

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.030
ten years of false accusations.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.960
Ten years!

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.150
Countless innocent clan members
were convicted and exiled.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.430
If I hadn't been studying
in Yizhou at the time,

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.560
I would have been imprisoned long ago.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.330
To pay for the Yang family's

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.160
crimes with Yang Dingchen's life alone

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.670
is already too lenient.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.580
What about Madam Yang?

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.520
Your Wei family members were innocent,

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.760
but does that mean
Madam Yang deserves to die?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.760
She never committed a single evil act,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.420
couldn't bear to harm anyone.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.150
Even though she suffered

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.280
mistreatment from
her mother-in-law and husband,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.150
she was still willing to stand up

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.940
and testify for your Wei family.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.870
All she asked for

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.500
was to live out her days in the temple.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.320
Yet you still wouldn't let her be

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.050
and had to push her to her death.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.800
She deserved to die.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.670
She was the source of hatred

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.400
between the Wei and Yang families—

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.760
a cursed woman.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.780
Because of her,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.440
the entire Wei family

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.760
suffered countless hardships.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.140
She didn't deserve to live in this world!

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:10.800
There were indeed

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.530
innocent people
who suffered in your Wei family.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.920
But your grandmother
abused your stepmother,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.590
and your father turned a blind eye.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.030
He was

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.340
the real source of all
family troubles and misfortunes.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.320
Instead of blaming
your grandmother for her severity

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.670
or resenting your father
for his incompetence,

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.320
or hating the Yang family
for their cruelty,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.580
you shift all the blame

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.030
onto a powerless woman—

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.800
clearly taking advantage of
her inability to fight back.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.600
How despicable and ridiculous.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.950
How dare you spout nonsense here

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.230
and claim injustice?

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.560
You don't deserve it!

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.880
Bao, calm down.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.350
Don't hurt yourself.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.370
He's not worth it.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.030
Ask him.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.150
Ask him.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.280
Why did he enter the Rong family

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.880
under false pretenses?

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.150
Wei Yao,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.000
you repeatedly tried
to get close to me before

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.440
just to lower my guard.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.030
You used me to suppress

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.890
Wen Can, He Xingming, and others.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.840
After I gained Lady Shanbao's favor,

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.000
you revealed my true identity

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.460
in front of the Rong family

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.440
to win Old Madam's approval

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:08.510
and become the final winner.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.390
You've been hiding
in the Rong family for days.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:12.710
Could it be that you

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.000
consider Lady Shanbao,
who helped Madam Yang,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.150
as your enemy too

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.120
and intend to take revenge
on the Rong family?

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.030
Lu Jianglai,

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.760
you've figured out

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.420
my intentions so thoroughly.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.280
But you're wrong about one thing:

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.190
my feelings for Lady Shanbao.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.310
At this point,

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.190
are you still trying

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.150
to slander me?

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.360
You're already a puddle of mud.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.170
There's no need to slander you.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.840
Rong Shanbao,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.280
what I told you before

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.850
about running for our lives

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.280
is true.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.030
You

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
don't deserve it.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.670
Yes.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.230
I don't deserve it.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.840
With my power alone,

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.260
reviving the fallen Wei family
would be difficult.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.800
But with

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.130
the position of the Rong family's master,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.400
it would be as easy as
turning my hand over.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.030
It's all because this nuisance didn't die.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.520
Otherwise, with the Yan family
far away in Shu region

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.130
and communication difficult,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.800
after a year or so,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.150
when the Rong family's descendants

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.840
carried Wei blood,

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:36.930
could you still

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.400
kill me and the child?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.760
I'm afraid you'll never

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.510
get that chance in this lifetime.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.310
Take him away!

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.510
Go!

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:17.470
Grandmother.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.320
Escort me back to my room.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.570
[Alternative Ways to Drink Tea]

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.480
Rong Yunxi!

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.940
Think carefully.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.110
If you dare keep him here,

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.440
you'll never get a share

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.890
of the Rong family's
tea plantations and shops.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.500
Without relying on the Rong family,

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.900
we need to think of
other ways to make money.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.060
I have an idea.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.940
Let's make innovative cold-brew tea.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.590
Nowadays in summer,

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.320
everyone loves cold-brew tea.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.280
Actually, the history of cold-brew tea

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.410
can be traced back to the Song Dynasty.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:38.050
During that era of
flourishing tea culture,

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.030
a scholar named He Dexiu

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.550
poured ice cubes over tea leaves,

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.000
inventing iced tea.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.320
The Song Dynasty also had

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.760
a tea-and-pastry

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.760
combination called Yulin Tea,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.840
made by carving candied winter melon

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.760
into different hollow shapes

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.070
before adding it to tea—

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:55.550
both tasty and fun.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.150
By the Ming Dynasty,

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.030
various fruit teas and dried fruit teas

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.890
became popular among the people,

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.520
like walnut and pine nut tea,

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.080
candied kumquat tea,

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.800
salted bamboo shoot,
sesame and osmanthus tea,

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.190
osmanthus and green bean tea,

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.440
osmanthus and kumquat tea,

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.670
salted cherry tea, etc.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.320
One could say there were
hundreds of tea flavors

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.360
and hundreds of tastes.
