00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.070
Physician Feng,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.950
is my daughter-in-law pregnant?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.430
Old Madam,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.920
Her Ladyship...

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.200
Her Ladyship must be mistaken.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.120
She is not with child.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.680
Are you certain?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.200
I have examined her pulse carefully.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.430
She is indeed not with child.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.630
Thanks.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.840
Maid,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.640
escort Physician Feng out.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.190
This way.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.760
How dare you, Shen!

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.200
You deceived me
by claiming you were pregnant!

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.320
Kneel!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.400
I...

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.150
I just made a mistake.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.280
Was it a mistake,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.070
or did you deceive me on purpose?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.270
I...

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.520
Nanzhi.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.680
These are the undergarments
you changed the other day.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.750
There is menstrual blood on them.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.630
You had your menses long ago,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.280
yet you dared claim you were pregnant.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.710
What crime should you answer for?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.360
Old Madam.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.830
I...

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.680
Shen Yaochu,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.280
you are full of lies
and hold human life in contempt.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.840
Now you even
fake a pregnancy to deceive me!

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.520
Once I find the bodies of
Concubine Tang and Concubine Qin,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.870
I will see you brought before the court.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.240
No, General!

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.470
General.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.870
Shen,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.280
there is no one left to shield you now.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.240
You have long shown me disrespect,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.800
and I let it pass.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.400
But you refuse to repent!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.710
Today, you will kneel in the courtyard
and reflect on your sins.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.120
Without my permission,
you are not to rise.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.140
(Stability Ensures Peace)

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.470
Old Madam,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.870
it's time to bathe the Marquis.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.310
Tending to this living corpse
day in and day out

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.070
is truly tiresome!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.630
But punishing Shen today

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.480
was truly satisfying.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.060
I thought

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.510
she and Li Jingchuan were deeply in love.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.510
Yet at the first setback,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.360
they fell apart.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.120
How ridiculous.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.580
(Stability Ensures Peace)

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.680
Judging by the dates,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.720
my Jingxu should be back.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.840
Sister-in-law.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.020
(Li Jingxu
Legitimate Son of Li Family)

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.880
Sister-in-law.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.680
Are you the Second Young Master?

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.920
Please call me Jingxu.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.160
I've been traveling for three years,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160
so you won't recognize me.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.840
But

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.950
why are you kneeling in the snow?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.830
It's freezing. You will fall ill.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.960
Please get up.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.400
I made a mistake.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120
Old Madam punished me to kneel.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.630
No matter the mistake,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.270
you shouldn't suffer this way.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.830
What if you fall ill?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.920
(Why did Li Jingxu suddenly show up?)

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.430
Isn't Brother at home?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.190
How can he let you kneel in the snow?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.070
General is...

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.310
He is angry with me.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.070
Brother has served in the army

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.560
and doesn't cherish women.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.600
Sister-in-law, please rise.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.640
Sister-in-law,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.240
Brother doesn't know, but I do.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.870
From now on, at home,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.920
I'll protect you, all right?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.640
Mother!

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.720
Jingxu is back!

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.030
He's back?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.270
Why... why didn't he come see me?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.560
I was so happy

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.190
that I rushed over to tell you.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.760
Hurry.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.070
Take me to see Jingxu.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.720
What are you doing?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.930
Mother,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.190
I thought it was too cold

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.750
and wished Sister-in-law to go rest.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.150
- JingXu!
- Mother,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.830
she has a fragile constitution.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.430
She cannot keep kneeling in the snow!

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.800
Consider this my plea on her behalf.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.510
Since Jingxu pleads on your behalf,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.430
I'll set aside the punishment.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.560
Get back to your room.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.630
Without my orders,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.240
do not take a single step outside.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.160
Thanks, Old Madam.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.000
Thanks, Brother-in-law.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.280
Li Jingxu!

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.910
Have you been bewitched

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.000
by that seductress?

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.480
She is Li Jingchuan's Principal Wife

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.910
and your sister-in-law!

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.390
So what?

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.870
You are to inherit your father's title.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.480
If word spreads,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.790
how will you hold your head up at court?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.870
Mother, don't worry.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.910
I have no interest
in another man's castoffs.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.910
Shen Yaochu

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.150
is just a pawn I use

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.670
against Li Jingchuan.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.240
But Li Jingchuan is truly lucky.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.510
He survived that assassination.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.870
Fortunately,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.320
there is no evidence now.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.320
By the way, Mother,

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.670
did that messenger Li Qiang die?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.240
I have sent someone to silence him.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.110
Good.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.480
After that assassination,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.000
he will surely be on guard.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440
But he may not

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.080
guard against this woman.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.270
Once I have this
foolish woman under control,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.390
I'll have her deal with Li Jingchuan.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.550
Wouldn't we reap the rewards
without lifting a finger?

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.550
Li Jingchuan will divorce Shen soon.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.670
She will be a useless pawn.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.680
That's fine.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.870
Don't worry, Mother.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.150
I will never let Jingchuan
inherit the title.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.870
Once that old man dies,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.030
the marquisate,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.790
and everything Li Jingchuan has,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.840
will all be mine.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.990
Do your knees hurt?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.320
I'm fine.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.910
I padded them secretly.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.480
They'll be fine soon.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.120
If we didn't put on a full act,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.080
how would Old Madam believe that

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.720
you and I had truly fallen out?

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.320
Does this full act

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.480
include your tugging
and pulling with Li Jingxu?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.800
Why are you smiling?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.080
Do you mind?

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.630
Yes,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.680
I do.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.320
I forbid you from
having contact with other men.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.790
That was never my intention.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.360
Your brother is licentious, vile,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.280
and hypocritical.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.630
So I thought

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.830
using him

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.670
to gain Old Madam's trust

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.790
might serve our purpose.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.750
Yaochu,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.260
if that's the case,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.390
the plan ends immediately.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.560
General,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.320
this concerns your assassination

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.480
and my mother's murder.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.000
But it also concerns my wife.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.630
If this plan

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.360
requires my wife to suffer humiliation,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.920
I will not allow it.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.920
What did you say?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.750
I will not allow it.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.110
Allow what?

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.960
My wife...

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.560
It's late.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.110
Then I will...

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.400
♪Is cause and effect in this world♪

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.080
Stay.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.860
♪A cycle repeated, or destinies crossed?♪

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.840
Yaochu,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.080
do you truly love me now,

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.870
