00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.400
Brother,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.710
it's been a long time.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.260
Indeed, it has.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.700
(The Seven Military Classics)

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.350
Did your journey go smoothly?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.840
With your reputation out there,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
how could it not?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.430
Go hide behind the Marquis household

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.430
and play tyrant. I don't care.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.870
But don't drag me into it.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.600
Brother,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.040
why are you so hostile toward me?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040
If I were not a General now,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.310
would you still treat me
with such respect?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.680
When we were young,
you never called me Brother.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.430
What did you call me then?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.150
Jerk.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.510
I...

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.430
I was young and foolish.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.280
You don't have to dwell on it, Brother.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.310
An insult carved to the bone.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.600
I dare not forget.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.040
Li Jingchuan!

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.150
I spoke to you in good faith,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.520
yet you humiliate me!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.150
Seems three years of travel

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.630
did nothing to change you.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.840
You couldn't keep up the act for long.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.800
Even if you are the General now,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.640
so what?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.360
Your mother was lowborn,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.560
so you are also a...

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.080
General.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.630
Li Jingchuan, just you wait!

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.590
General,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.590
I have urgent news.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.120
Go ahead.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.240
I have found someone

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.840
involved in the assassination that day.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.000
This person also delivered

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.750
letters for Lord Qin and Old Madam.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.920
Old Madam.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.750
What are you doing here?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.960
I forbade you to go out.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.030
I have come

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.870
to beg you for forgiveness.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.710
Shen,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.360
what are you up to now?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.400
I only made a small mistake,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.590
yet the General treats me so harshly.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.590
He is clearly unreliable.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.190
I don't want to go to prison.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.560
I've offended you many times.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.840
You are magnanimous.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.360
Please spare me a way to live

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.890
and protect me.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.840
You want me to save you?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.990
Old Madam,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.560
although Li Jingchuan

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.280
is a concubine-born son,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.240
he has great military merit.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.030
He might inherit the title.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.800
Jingxu is the legitimate son,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.310
and also your own blood.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.520
He is the rightful heir.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.960
Surely you don't wish

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.400
your own son's inheritance blocked.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.840
For this matter,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.310
our goals align.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.000
Xu'er is the legitimate son.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.560
He will inherit the title.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.150
Besides,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.600
what can you help me with?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.510
I have a plan.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.830
Please hear me out.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.920
Those outside the manor

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.680
do not know the true cause
of Concubine Qin and Tang's deaths.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.560
If the world believes

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.680
Li Jingchuan is cruel and violent,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.240
killing his concubines,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.680
what use is military merit then?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.870
It cannot quell public outrage.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.680
As long as you persuade Lord Qin
and the Tang family to file charges

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.240
at the Court of Judicial Review,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.480
you and I will both be witnesses.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.680
Very well.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.040
Let's do as you say.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.040
Bad news! Bad news!

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.920
General! Old Madam!

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.830
Bad news!

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.270
Lord Qin and Mr. Tang
have struck the Appeal Drum,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600
accusing the General of
murdering his concubines!

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.240
The General is summoned to court
with the Qin and Tang families.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.580
(Court of Judicial Review)

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.000
I...

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.360
I accuse Li Jingchuan

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.360
of murdering his concubines

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.390
and disregarding human life!

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.750
I, Qin Heng,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.160
accuse the Li household

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.310
of killing my daughter, Qin Ruoyi.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.390
Had I not yearned for my daughter,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.800
I would not have known

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.800
she was killed by them!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.440
Your Honor,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.720
I wish to accuse as well.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.920
My daughter Yuzhu

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.190
was also brutally killed.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.070
Master of the Lis,
step forward.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.590
Your Honor,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.240
I am the matriarch of the Li household.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.240
My husband has been bedridden for years,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.430
and I manage the inner household.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.600
Old Madam, do you know
of what they allege?

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.310
Yes, I do.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.800
It is true.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.830
Who committed the crime?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.640
It was...

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.880
It was her,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.950
Shen Yaochu!

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.360
Shen, step forward.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.720
You tricked me.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.800
I will not bear the charge of
harming a concubine-born son.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.440
Your Honor.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.760
Shen,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.870
did you kill Tang Yuzhu

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.360
and Qin Ruoyi?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.870
No, I didn't,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.710
Your Honor.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.360
There is now a witness identifying you.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.000
What proof do you have

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.040
that you did not kill them?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.590
Your Honor,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.750
I also have a witness.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.560
Summon the witness.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.830
Weren't you dead?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.390
I've done so many dirty deeds for you!

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.000
I can't believe you want to kill me!

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.040
Stop falsely accusing me here!

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.270
Your Honor,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.110
it was her!

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.310
She and Young Master Jingxu ordered me.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.870
It has nothing to do with me!

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.920
That's nonsense!

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.720
Do not slander me,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.800
or I...

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.160
Identify yourself and state your grievance.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.070
I am Li Qiang,

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.680
a servant of the Li Manor,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.070
serving Old Madam and Young Master Jingxu.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.520
Two months ago,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.990
Old Madam Young Master Jingxu

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.160
resented Young Master Jingchuan's rise,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.160
so they had me deliver letters

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.190
to collude with Lord Qin,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.680
hire assassins, and kill.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.200
Tell me,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.430
who told you to frame me?

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.830
That's nonsense!

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.560
What does this have to do with me?

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.630
Your Honor,

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.600
every word I speak is true!

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.200
This is the evidence.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.480
Lord Qin had me
deliver this letter to Old Madam.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.200
But Old Madam wanted to silence me

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.150
before she even read it.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.150
You dare use false evidence
to frame me and my mother!

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.590
You...

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.680
Jingxu!

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.320
Enough!

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.000
How dare you cause trouble in court!

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.600
Present the evidence.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.500
(The plot to assassinate
Li Jingchuan may be exposed.)

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.750
The letter states

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.550
the assassination of General Li.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.630
It also bears the Qin household seal.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.870
Lord Qin,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.150
you dare plot

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.000
against the General!

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.390
What treachery is this?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.240
Your Honor,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.630
Old... Old Madam

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.630
ordered me to do it.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.800
Nonsense!

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.200
Lord Qin,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.870
you said I had ordered you,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.080
so this letter must be written by you.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.240
Who can prove it was for me?

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.560
You...

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.270
Are you trying to frame me?

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.600
What? How could you still deny it?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.390
- Your Honor...
- And you, Li Qiang.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.000
You claimed to be my servant.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.070
Does anyone in the Li Manor

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.150
recognize you?

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.360
I have worked for you in secret.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.720
Of course no one recognizes me.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.360
You have no witness or proof,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.510
so you are framing me.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.750
Exactly!

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.360
Qin Heng, now both
witness and evidence are present.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.080
What excuses do you have left?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.270
You old wretch!

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.480
To clear your name,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.120
you drag me down with you!

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.350
You...

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.670
This matter is serious.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.360
Detain Qin Heng for now.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.200
Your Honor, I am wronged.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.630
I am wronged!

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
You old wretch!

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.720
You are cruel and vicious.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.480
You will die a miserable death!

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.120
Die a miserable death!

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.230
Your Honor,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.270
the case of Shen Yaochu killing

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.630
remains unresolved.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.750
The bodies have not yet been found.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.240
With only testimony,
it is insufficient for conviction.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.440
Not finding the bodies

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.390
does not prove her innocent.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.550
Not finding the bodies

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.630
also does not prove I killed anyone.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.720
Then Shen shall be detained for now.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.160
I am here.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.080
Father.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.080
Yuzhu.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.200
You...

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.550
You are alive!

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.270
Father, I am not dead.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.630
Good.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.230
Good.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.750
Your Honor,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.910
the real killer framed me

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.240
for killing Concubine Qin.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.870
General and Her Ladyship trusted me

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.870
and spared my life.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.000
They had me hide to lure out the killer.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.150
Though the true culprit
is not yet found today,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.320
I cannot stand by

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.910
and watch them be framed.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.390
So,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.200
I have come to testify for them.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.030
Are you foolish?

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.840
I told you to hide.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.960
Now you come out.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.870
What about your reputation?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.390
You have treated me so well.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.840
How could I watch you be wronged?

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.160
Your Honor,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.720
can this prove the innocence of

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.200
Her Ladyship and the General?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.080
Mr. Tang, is she your daughter?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.200
Yes.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.720
She is Yuzhu, my daughter.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.150
Very well.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.840
Qin Ruoyi's body has yet to be found.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.750
After further investigation,
this case will be retried another day.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.720
Until then, all related parties

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.790
are forbidden to leave the capital.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.510
General Li, Old Madam,

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.630
what do you say?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.750
Yes.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.390
I understand.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.750
But Li Jingxu showed
contempt for the court

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.240
and attempted to seize evidence.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.270
(Order)
Give him twenty lashes.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.390
- Carry it out at once.
- Yes!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.270
Your Honor, please don't!

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.750
Jingxu is young. He knows nothing!

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.320
Mother, save me!

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.480
- Jingxu!
- Mother!

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.320
Jingxu!

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.840
- Jingxu!
- Save me, Mother!

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.270
Your Honor, he cannot
endure such punishment!

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.510
Your Honor!

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.720
Please spare me!

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.120
(Court of Judicial Review)
Please, Your Honor!

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.910
Jingxu!
