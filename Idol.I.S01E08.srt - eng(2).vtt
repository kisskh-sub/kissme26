WEBVTT

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:39.060
Choi Jae-hee,
a member of the idol group, Gold Boys,

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:42.814
who has been questioned as a witness
in the murder case of the late Woo-seong,

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:46.067
was involved in a car accident last night
and is now confirmed to be

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.069
in critical condition and unconscious.

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.822
Authorities are currently investigating

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.533
the exact circumstances
and cause of the accident.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.453
Witnesses report
that Mr. Choi had been showing

00:00:57.537 --> 00:00:59.914
signs of instability
following the incident,

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:02.917
and a document believed to be a will
was found at the scene,

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.378
prompting investigators
to consider the possibility…

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.881
We controlled the bleeding
through a craniotomy

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:09.465
and removed the hematoma.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.093
For now, all we can do
is keep him sedated in the ICU

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.596
and monitor his condition closely.

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:15.680
Then,

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.850
what's going to happen to him?

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:23.104
If the damaged area
of the brain continues to swell

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.106
and the pressure compresses the nerves,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.400
he could suffer neurological damage.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.027
What does that mean?

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:30.570
La-ik.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:33.573
What happened?

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.618
I said, what happened?

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:38.661
Hey, come here. Let's talk over here.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.706
I need to see him.
I have to see him myself…

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.334
Hey! You can't be here right now!

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.213
-You need to get out before the reporters…
-That's what you're worried about?

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.550
Jae-hee ended up like that!

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.677
Why would he…

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:56.179
Why would he try to kill himself?

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.264
They found a note.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:05.313
A suicide note saying
he'd confess to everything.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:07.440
What?

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.988
How is Choi Jae-hee doing?

00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:15.990
They say he might not make it
through the day.

00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:19.869
And when we checked his call log,

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:24.165
he had tried calling
quite a few people besides you.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.211
He called Do La-ik,
he called Geum Bo-sang.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.382
The only person
he actually got through to was Bo-sang,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:36.177
but apparently, he hung up right away
without saying much.

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.471
People tend to do that
before attempting suicide.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.848
They cling to their phones
because they're distressed…

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:44.602
I heard they found
a suicide note at the scene.

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:48.189
We secured his phone.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.819
Everything was written in there.
"I killed Kang Woo-seong.

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.572
"I will atone with my death.
Do not forgive me."

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.327
But something's bothering me.

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:02.745
Why would Choi Jae-hee

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:07.208
call you at the very end?

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.669
It's not like you two were close.

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.588
I don't know.
I've been wondering that too.

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.635
Actually…

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.305
he left me a voice message that day.

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:22.765
He did?

00:03:28.813 --> 00:03:30.189
CHOI JAE-HEE - VOICE MESSAGE

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.817
Why aren't either of you picking up?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.444
Are you with La-ik right now?

00:03:35.028 --> 00:03:36.779
I'm in a situation, and I need some help.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:39.741
There's something
I forgot to tell you earlier.

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.758
About the day
when that happened to Woo-seong.

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:09.020
I called Woo-seong again at dawn,
in the parking lot.

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.116
I'm sure it was his ringtone.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:30.041
But thinking about it now,
I think that ringtone

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.377
came from the garden side.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:35.088
Yes, understood.

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:51.145
He probably mistook it for another sound.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.148
Maybe. But doesn't it seem strange?

00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:57.527
A man who left a suicide note
confessing to everything,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.654
says something like that
right before he died.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.448
You're saying Choi Jae-hee
wasn't the real culprit?

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.911
If the sound he heard
really was Woo-seong's phone,

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:09.372
then it means the killer took his phone

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.208
and fled in that direction.

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:20.007
Could you ask the residents over there
if they noticed anything that night?

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:21.884
Let's stop this.

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:26.764
You're not La-ik's lawyer anymore.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.061
Do you remember?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.522
You told me once,

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.607
"If you keep holding on to the past,

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.568
you're the only one
who ends up stuck there."

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:40.695
"You need to step out of it."

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.616
This is your second time already.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.452
You do know repeated offenses
come with heavier penalties?

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:51.164
What else can I do?
I have to make a living.

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:58.171
Anyway,

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:01.799
what goes through your mind
when you stand in front of it?

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:05.136
-What?
-You said you remember me.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.764
We see each other at the columbarium
every year, must be the same memorial day.

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.475
When you stand there,

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.729
in front of the one you lost,
what do you think about?

00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:16.063
Why are you asking me that?

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:19.650
Because if I were you,
I'd be ashamed to be living like this.

00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:23.237
-Excuse me?
-The reason your sentence was reduced

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.115
was because of the difficult life
you'd been through.

00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:28.492
But that doesn't excuse anything.

00:06:29.577 --> 00:06:31.162
No matter how hard your past was,

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:34.457
using it as a shield to justify
the way you live is self-deception.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.042
You don't know anything about me.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.711
I'm not the one treating you carelessly.
It's you.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:47.011
Whenever I stand

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:51.557
in front of that place,
I make the same promise.

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:55.519
THE LATE MAENG JI-YONG,
THE LATE PARK SU-HEE

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:58.272
As long as I'm alive,
I'm going to live with dignity.

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:05.446
If you keep clinging to the past,

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:07.907
you're the only one
who ends up stuck there.

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:13.788
People who lean on their misery
to live their lives,

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:15.831
I can't defend people like that.

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:28.010
After you said that,
I really tried to live differently.

00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:31.847
I tried to bury the past
and keep my eyes forward.

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:36.978
So why are you the one
clinging to the past now?

00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:41.065
Why are you stuck on Do La-ik?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.693
You told me not to do that.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:48.322
Do La-ik…

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.033
is already gone.

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.369
He was never part
of our world to begin with.

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:25.359
I heard they caught the culprit.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.989
The suspect confessed, but he's in a coma.

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:32.450
The investigation will be on hold
until he wakes up,

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:35.536
and if he dies, the case will be closed.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.913
So what's your plan?

00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:49.008
If you only play safe
and defensive like this,

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:51.677
there comes a moment
where you can't attack at all,

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.138
and all you can do is throw in the towel.

00:08:57.725 --> 00:09:00.603
That girl you investigated last time,
Hong Hye-joo.

00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:03.773
You do know she's the daughter
of Chairman Hong of Imhwa Group?

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.068
Yes, I'm aware.

00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:12.782
Chairman Hong was furious.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:14.992
Seems the girl…

00:09:15.618 --> 00:09:18.454
had some sort of relationship
with Do La-ik,

00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:23.125
and the chairman despised it.

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:29.548
If we'd pinned everything on him

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.802
and gotten him 20 years,

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:35.096
I would've made
a clean entrance into politics,

00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:38.224
and you would've strengthened
your hold on the prosecution.

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:42.269
It would've been the perfect scenario.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.689
A shame it didn't work out.

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:51.362
I had no idea you had such intentions.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:56.033
Byung-gyun.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.828
A long time ago,

00:09:59.412 --> 00:10:02.832
I went through something similar.

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.668
We had a suspect.

00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:08.546
Motive was solid, but no evidence.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.756
And he wouldn't confess.

00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:15.428
No matter how hard we pressed,
he kept insisting he was innocent.

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:18.055
Then…

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.724
he hung himself

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:22.351
in prison.

00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:25.646
It caused quite the commotion.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.523
They called it coercive interrogation,

00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:31.736
and almost cost me my badge.

00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:34.697
But then…

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:37.658
how do you think I ended up sitting here?

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:45.958
If you want,

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:49.545
you could throw in the towel here
and end the game.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:52.214
But there's still a chance left.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:56.677
It depends entirely on you.

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:13.360
Hello, this is Choi Jae-hee.

00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:17.990
The real person who killed Kang Woo-seong

00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:20.117
wasn't Do La-ik. It was me.

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:25.623
My fear and anger over a bleak future

00:11:25.706 --> 00:11:28.209
ended up
driving me in the wrong direction.

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:32.129
I made a mistake I can never undo.

00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.464
MISSING CALL: CHOI JAE-HEE

00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:43.766
I'll apologize to Woo-seong in person.

00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:47.394
I'll be able to see him soon anyway.

00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:51.899
And…

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:57.905
please tell Do La-ik that I'm sorry.

00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:02.785
My death is entirely my own doing.

00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:07.206
No one else is responsible.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.587
I will atone with my life.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.799
Please, don't forgive me.

00:15:56.935 --> 00:15:58.604
I had nowhere else to go.

00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:04.902
I didn't know where I was supposed to be.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:07.321
So I just walked.

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:12.743
And ended up here.

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:20.209
Everyone says Jae-hee is the killer now.

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:26.173
Not me, but him.

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:28.175
JAE-HEE'S CONFESSION NOTE
SHAKES UP THE CASE

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:32.221
I can't believe it.

00:16:34.223 --> 00:16:35.808
Why would he…

00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.686
They found a knife,

00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:42.606
presumed to be the murder weapon,

00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:47.069
and a suicide note in his car.
You heard that, right?

00:16:49.613 --> 00:16:50.656
The note says

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.408
he killed Woo-seong.

00:16:54.368 --> 00:16:57.538
The police consider it decisive evidence.

00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:01.208
And with his suicide attempt confirmed,

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:07.047
the case will be closed.

00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:09.133
How does that make any sense?

00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:14.429
The prosecution won't reopen the case.

00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:17.808
They're already being criticized
for focusing solely on you

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.476
and missing the real culprit.

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:22.271
If they reopen the case now,

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:25.899
it's basically admitting
their entire case was a mess.

00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:27.651
I don't care about any of that.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.736
I just want the truth.

00:17:32.364 --> 00:17:33.448
Tell me.

00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:37.077
Do you really think he's the culprit?

00:17:38.704 --> 00:17:42.291
The police, the prosecution,
everyone outside,

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:44.960
they can say whatever they want
and believe whatever they want.

00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:47.880
But not you.

00:17:47.963 --> 00:17:49.381
You were our fan.

00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:53.677
You must've seen him more than anyone.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.220
Does this make sense to you?

00:17:57.514 --> 00:17:58.807
Does he seem like…

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:01.310
someone who could do something like that?

00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:08.901
I can't believe it.

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:11.737
He isn't that kind of person.

00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:14.907
And even if he really
did that to Woo-seong,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.784
I need to know why, what pushed him there.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:19.995
There has to be a reason.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.414
Right?

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.583
With the suicide note discovered,

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:27.794
the investigation into the initial suspect
is being called into question.

00:18:27.878 --> 00:18:30.881
How do you respond to claims
you got the suspect wrong from the start?

00:18:30.964 --> 00:18:33.175
-Please say something!
-A comment, please!

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:39.306
Prosecutor, just one comment, please!

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.644
So this is how
the great Byung-gyun goes down, huh?

00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:45.562
Isn't this a fatal blow?

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:47.898
A fatal blow? He's beyond recovery.

00:18:47.981 --> 00:18:50.525
He kept beating on the same guy,
and now it's blown up.

00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:53.237
Do La-ik was found at the murder scene.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.031
So, of course,
he dug only in that direction.

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:58.575
But does the public care about that?

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:01.787
The media already slapped a frame on it
that it was a botched investigation,

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.331
saying there were clear mistakes
in naming the suspect.

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:08.669
If Do La-ik starts shouting
about coercive interrogation or whatever,

00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:11.338
he's finished.

00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:14.633
He'll be completely shut out.

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:17.344
Politics? Please.
He won't be able to open a law office.

00:19:18.178 --> 00:19:20.472
-How did it come to this?
-He'll figure it out somehow.

00:19:23.433 --> 00:19:25.686
Sir, it's too much right now.

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:27.521
Having La-ik prepare
for a comeback already…

00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:29.898
This isn't a matter of choice.

00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:34.069
La-ik knows that too. To survive here,
he knows what he has to do.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.117
The public may hate a perpetrator,
but they love someone who's been wronged.

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:43.370
There's no better timing

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:47.207
-for his comeback than right now.
-But Jae-hee is…

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:51.378
With everything going on,
how can he stand in front of people?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.508
-Han-gu.
-Yes.

00:19:57.676 --> 00:20:01.930
When did I ever ask for your opinion?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.184
Go bring La-ik.

00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:08.520
I'll handle convincing him.

00:20:48.143 --> 00:20:51.438
I'll go check it out and let you know
if there's any progress.

00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:54.024
I'm going with you.

00:20:57.486 --> 00:20:58.737
With me?

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:03.658
I'm the one who asked you.
I can't let you go there alone.

00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:08.663
Is it uncomfortable being with me?

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.335
I want to see it for myself.

00:21:14.336 --> 00:21:17.255
Where Jae-hee was last.

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:20.675
What happened there.
I need to see it with my own eyes.

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:22.320
I think this is the place.

00:22:23.697 --> 00:22:25.073
According to the news,

00:22:25.157 --> 00:22:28.785
there isn't any CCTV around here at all,
so nothing about the crash was captured.

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:30.704
The dashcam was dead too.

00:22:35.167 --> 00:22:38.044
-Where are you going?
-Don't follow me. It's dangerous.

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:43.049
Are you going down there?

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:55.562
I said don't follow me.

00:22:56.146 --> 00:22:58.273
I'm not following you.
I want to take a look…

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.625
Take my hand.

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:48.073
I think it's there.

00:23:55.872 --> 00:23:57.082
That's a pretty sharp slope.

00:23:57.958 --> 00:23:59.501
But doesn't something feel off to you?

00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:03.088
Like the police said,

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:05.465
if Jae-hee really intended
to take his own life,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.511
he would've floored the accelerator.

00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:11.554
But seeing it in person,

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:15.725
the point where the car fell
seems too close.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.698
HONG HYE-JOO

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:28.757
You're still listening to that?

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:33.928
No, it's just…

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:37.223
So, you're all done?

00:25:37.307 --> 00:25:39.184
Yes. I'll hand it over to the prosecution.

00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:43.521
And really,
don't think too much about that.

00:25:43.605 --> 00:25:46.983
He just said it
because he thought he was in trouble.

00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:52.072
You know,
real culprits use that trick all the time.

00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:56.534
Well…

00:26:11.257 --> 00:26:12.717
This is the place.

00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:14.427
According to the article,

00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:17.430
Jae-hee stayed here
for a few days before the accident.

00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:20.100
He was here?

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:24.062
Yes. Why?

00:26:27.732 --> 00:26:28.650
Nothing.

00:26:54.384 --> 00:26:55.635
Welcome.

00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:58.346
Hi, I wanted to ask you something.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:59.848
Sure, go ahead.

00:27:03.268 --> 00:27:04.436
Aren't you La-ik?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.359
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

00:27:11.443 --> 00:27:14.070
I already told the police everything.

00:27:14.154 --> 00:27:16.489
That's really all I know.

00:27:16.573 --> 00:27:20.243
So you're saying he suddenly showed up
on the night of the 13th?

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:23.329
Yes. I saw him myself.
I was on the night shift that day.

00:27:24.664 --> 00:27:27.959
He came alone without a reservation
and asked for a room.

00:27:28.042 --> 00:27:29.836
At first, I wondered who he was,

00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:31.671
but when I looked closely, it was Jae-hee.

00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:36.092
I've been a fan of you guys for ten years.

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:40.638
Did you notice anything unusual about him?

00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:44.601
Nothing besides his expression.
He didn't look well.

00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:47.103
I even wanted to ask for an autograph,

00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:50.231
but he looked so down,
I couldn't say anything.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.152
Did he meet anyone?
Or did anyone come looking for him?

00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:55.653
No, no one.

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:58.698
I even swapped shifts
so I could stay the whole time,

00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.658
and he never left the room.

00:28:01.868 --> 00:28:04.829
Then suddenly, he went out,
and the next day…

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:07.207
that article came out.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.001
Is there any CCTV footage?

00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:12.212
The police already took everything.

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.467
And all the belongings he left
in his room too.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.260
They took it all.

00:28:19.344 --> 00:28:21.804
-He left his things?
-Yes.

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:24.015
Just one bag,

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:26.976
but he didn't pack anything.
He left it there and walked out.

00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:32.148
Anyway, are you okay?

00:28:33.107 --> 00:28:34.692
Please take care of yourself.

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:37.111
We're all rooting for you.

00:28:48.373 --> 00:28:52.168
He didn't know anyone here,
and he wasn't here to meet anyone.

00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:56.381
So why did he stay in this place?
Was it really just a coincidence?

00:28:57.131 --> 00:28:58.508
It wasn't a coincidence.

00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:03.471
I think I know why he came here.

00:29:08.518 --> 00:29:11.729
CHUN-HYANG TRADITIONAL FESTIVAL

00:29:28.997 --> 00:29:30.665
Nothing has changed here.

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:40.967
CHUN-HYANG TRADITIONAL FESTIVAL

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:47.557
This was Gold Boys' first stage.

00:29:49.267 --> 00:29:52.687
Even after we debuted, nobody called us.
We just kept busking on the streets.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.564
This was the first venue that invited us.

00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:23.301
It looks okay now.

00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:26.387
Back then, the equipment,
the sound system, everything was a mess.

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:29.474
Performing on the street was easier.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.603
They didn't even set up the instruments,
so we pretended to play over the MR.

00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:35.271
I was so pissed that day.

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:36.481
I know.

00:30:37.482 --> 00:30:39.901
The grandmas kept shouting
for Kim Seong-jun to come out…

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:52.121
Still, it was good.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:53.706
What the hell!

00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:57.085
-Bring Kim Seong-jun!
-Back then, just being on a stage

00:30:57.877 --> 00:30:59.045
was all we ever wanted.

00:30:59.128 --> 00:31:01.881
Hello, we're Gold Boys!

00:31:08.137 --> 00:31:11.599
And that hotel earlier,
CEO Geum arranged it for us

00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:13.184
since it was our first performance.

00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:16.688
It was the best day ever.

00:31:18.064 --> 00:31:21.401
I think that's why Jae-hee came here too.

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:24.862
And he wanted to see that.

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:32.245
There's a secret here.
Something only we know about.

00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:51.347
Where are we going?

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:53.433
Almost there.

00:32:03.234 --> 00:32:06.696
THE FOREST OF WISHES

00:32:10.867 --> 00:32:12.493
It should be around here somewhere.

00:32:13.578 --> 00:32:14.996
This is the secret?

00:32:17.123 --> 00:32:19.292
When we came here
for our very first performance,

00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:21.127
we wrote down our wishes.

00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:25.840
This is it!

00:32:44.317 --> 00:32:46.819
They're hanging them on the tree.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.405
Hey, there's an empty spot.

00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:51.991
-Where?
-There!

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:55.411
Last one to hang it up is dead last…

00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:58.289
Okay, this one's mine.

00:32:59.999 --> 00:33:01.209
Yeah, hang it there.

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:07.340
Hang it well. Don't let ours fall.

00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:09.926
-Right.
-Okay.

00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:12.428
"Billboard," Jae-hee!

00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:13.888
Stop!

00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:18.101
PLEASE LET ME MAKE A LOT OF MONEY - LA-IK

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.021
Jae-hee once told me something.

00:33:23.898 --> 00:33:26.192
Whenever things got tough,
he'd come back here.

00:33:28.277 --> 00:33:30.029
He said it helped him feel at ease.

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:33.783
PLEASE LET US GET ON BILLBOARD - JAE-HEE

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:45.002
Woo-seong, La-ik, Jae-hee, Young-bin.
Forever one.

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.420
Huh? This…

00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:49.882
So he really did come here.

00:33:54.846 --> 00:33:56.305
I should tell the police…

00:33:57.265 --> 00:33:58.432
Wait.

00:34:06.524 --> 00:34:07.567
Don't look.

00:34:08.818 --> 00:34:09.652
I won't.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.657
Once the police investigation starts,
people might find out about this place.

00:34:15.575 --> 00:34:17.368
So I want to make my wish before that.

00:34:17.952 --> 00:34:21.455
Wishes only come true
when no one knows about them.

00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:53.362
MAY EVERYONE I LOVE
BE HAPPY IN MY MEMORIES

00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:05.791
Isn't the case already closed?

00:35:07.335 --> 00:35:09.045
The deputy chief told us

00:35:09.795 --> 00:35:11.172
to put the investigation on hold.

00:35:13.382 --> 00:35:15.134
There's nothing much.

00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:22.183
According to the report, he seems
to have taken pills before the accident,

00:35:23.267 --> 00:35:24.477
and they found a suicide note.

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:27.772
REPORT

00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:32.568
DRUG TOXICOLOGY REPORT

00:35:35.655 --> 00:35:37.323
-Mr. Heo.
-Yes.

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.617
Where is Do La-ik's toxicology report?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.245
Oh, Mr. Do La-ik's? Just a moment.

00:35:56.133 --> 00:36:00.596
REPORT

00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:03.724
SODIUM OXYBATE DETECTED

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:06.978
SODIUM OXYBATE DETECTED

00:36:08.729 --> 00:36:11.899
The substance detected
in Choi Jae-hee's blood

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:14.318
was Tri-Oxibate.

00:36:14.402 --> 00:36:17.154
It has anxiolytic effects, induces sleep,

00:36:17.238 --> 00:36:20.199
and suppresses the central nervous system.

00:36:20.992 --> 00:36:23.286
How much do you estimate he took?

00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:25.871
Based on the blood concentration,

00:36:25.955 --> 00:36:27.373
at least ten tablets, maybe more.

00:36:27.957 --> 00:36:31.168
But it's not the kind of drug
that knocks you out instantly.

00:36:31.252 --> 00:36:36.632
It usually takes 20 to 30 minutes
for consciousness to gradually decline.

00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:38.551
If he was driving,

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:41.012
he would have had trouble
with basic actions like braking.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:43.889
The same substance was detected

00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:45.683
in Do La-ik when he was arrested.

00:36:45.766 --> 00:36:48.185
Yes. But he also said

00:36:48.269 --> 00:36:52.398
he'd been taking psychiatric medication
for panic disorder.

00:36:52.982 --> 00:36:56.819
This drug is pretty commonly prescribed
here and abroad.

00:36:58.904 --> 00:37:02.074
So you still think
Do La-ik is the culprit?

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:09.081
If you play it too safe,

00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:10.875
you'll end up throwing in the towel.

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:31.145
Chief.

00:37:31.228 --> 00:37:34.190
How many investigators
do we have available right now?

00:37:34.273 --> 00:37:37.985
None at the moment.
The whole team's been reassigned.

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:40.571
Then gather a few people
who can move off the record.

00:37:41.238 --> 00:37:42.406
Sorry? What?

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.179
Hey…

00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:15.231
I guess we stayed in here too long.

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:19.527
The management office is…

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.444
Wait.

00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:23.072
Walk…

00:38:24.323 --> 00:38:25.199
with me for a minute?

00:38:38.963 --> 00:38:40.714
I can finally breathe.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.678
It's been a long time
since I've been somewhere this quiet.

00:38:46.887 --> 00:38:49.807
I always wanted to take a walk somewhere

00:38:51.142 --> 00:38:52.852
with no one around.

00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.348
Here.

00:39:32.016 --> 00:39:33.058
It's okay. I'm not cold.

00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:35.436
No worries. Consider it a favor for a fan.

00:39:37.688 --> 00:39:39.690
I'm not your fan anymore.

00:39:41.484 --> 00:39:44.028
-I think you've got the wrong idea…
-Really?

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.614
Is that why you threw everything out?

00:39:46.697 --> 00:39:47.656
What?

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.576
I saw it in front of your place.
You tossed all of it.

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.286
My albums, the merch…

00:39:55.164 --> 00:39:57.458
You must have spent a lot.

00:39:57.541 --> 00:39:59.543
Looked like you'd been collecting
since my debut.

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:05.049
It's just…

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:08.260
It's not worth that much.

00:40:09.803 --> 00:40:11.013
So what did you like so much?

00:40:14.308 --> 00:40:17.394
Me. Why did you like me that much?

00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:25.444
I just…

00:40:27.196 --> 00:40:28.072
did.

00:40:29.156 --> 00:40:30.241
Just because.

00:40:31.116 --> 00:40:32.868
There's no reason for liking someone.

00:40:37.957 --> 00:40:39.041
I know the reason.

00:40:42.586 --> 00:40:43.546
The red hat.

00:40:47.424 --> 00:40:49.093
The one I gave you.

00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:02.398
I kept thinking I'd seen it somewhere.

00:41:03.107 --> 00:41:04.483
And then it hit me.

00:41:05.276 --> 00:41:07.069
That hat was mine when I was a kid.

00:41:08.571 --> 00:41:09.863
And then I remembered

00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:13.534
who I gave it to.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:20.916
That day…

00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:23.669
I was having a really hard day too.

00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:25.254
So I remember it.

00:41:33.304 --> 00:41:34.680
This is really all you made?

00:41:39.977 --> 00:41:42.187
What does your agency even do, huh?

00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:45.983
Do they think making you sing out
on the street brings in money?

00:41:47.484 --> 00:41:49.778
You know how much you made
from those gigs?

00:41:50.487 --> 00:41:54.074
Idol or whatever.
You're just getting silly ideas.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.076
I'm leaving.

00:41:57.244 --> 00:41:58.078
Mom.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.960
It's been months since I saw you.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.088
You know that?

00:42:11.592 --> 00:42:13.052
I know.

00:42:13.636 --> 00:42:15.054
But…

00:42:15.137 --> 00:42:17.139
we've both been busy.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:18.932
I'm sick.

00:42:22.102 --> 00:42:24.313
I have a fever, I'm coughing.

00:42:26.315 --> 00:42:27.149
I'm really sick.

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:32.154
Just hang in there a little longer.
Once I make money, I'll come pick you up.

00:42:32.738 --> 00:42:35.407
I'm not leaving you to rot like this.
You know that, right?

00:42:55.302 --> 00:42:58.055
Spring had come,
but it didn't feel like spring.

00:42:59.932 --> 00:43:01.975
That day was unusually cold.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.840
When life felt unbearably miserable,

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:35.467
when I couldn't understand…

00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:38.470
what I was even living for.

00:43:40.764 --> 00:43:42.558
When I wanted to give everything up…

00:43:59.825 --> 00:44:01.160
that's when I saw

00:44:01.744 --> 00:44:04.371
someone who looked
even more dejected than me.

00:44:22.014 --> 00:44:25.934
So I couldn't just look away.

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.706
Because I saw myself in you.

00:44:49.082 --> 00:44:50.459
I guess I wanted to comfort you.

00:45:35.587 --> 00:45:37.214
That was the first time…

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:45.097
The first time I ever felt like my heart
actually reached someone.

00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:53.647
I'd always thought
I was meaningless, useless.

00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:58.110
But in that moment, I realized
I could be a comfort to someone,

00:45:58.193 --> 00:46:00.195
even if just for a single second.

00:46:05.993 --> 00:46:07.703
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize you.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:14.376
I honestly never imagined it was you.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.090
But you've really changed a lot.

00:46:27.598 --> 00:46:29.766
Why were you like that?

00:46:32.144 --> 00:46:35.314
That day. Why were you hurting so much?

00:46:49.995 --> 00:46:51.330
My father…

00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:55.459
had died in prison.

00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:04.051
He was charged with murder
and sentenced to life.

00:47:05.677 --> 00:47:07.304
He kept insisting he was innocent

00:47:08.555 --> 00:47:10.932
and then he hanged himself.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.145
My mother couldn't take the shock
and passed away soon after.

00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:20.275
And just like that,
I was alone in that house.

00:47:24.071 --> 00:47:27.032
I was suddenly left alone in the world.

00:47:28.241 --> 00:47:31.036
No matter how much I thought about it,

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:33.163
I couldn't find a reason to live.

00:47:36.625 --> 00:47:38.210
But that day,

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.047
when I heard you singing,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.591
I thought…

00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:47.427
"Live.

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:50.764
"Just try living."

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.392
"If I keep going,

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.311
maybe someday I'll find a reason."

00:47:58.814 --> 00:48:00.315
"So let's…

00:48:01.858 --> 00:48:03.360
not give up."

00:48:04.403 --> 00:48:05.737
"Let's live…

00:48:08.281 --> 00:48:09.533
to the very end."

00:48:13.787 --> 00:48:17.207
So I decided to try living.

00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:22.087
And I made it all the way here
thanks to you.

00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:28.802
Do you know

00:48:29.886 --> 00:48:31.722
how happy I was when you debuted?

00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:35.016
I was happier than
when I passed the bar exam.

00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:37.978
I liked you that much.

00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.867
Saying it all out loud
makes me feel lighter.

00:48:54.202 --> 00:48:57.581
I'm sorry I hid it.
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

00:48:59.207 --> 00:49:00.459
Thank you.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.631
For being the one who cheered the loudest
when I shined.

00:49:08.717 --> 00:49:09.676
For staying by my side

00:49:11.386 --> 00:49:13.013
when things were hard.

00:49:15.432 --> 00:49:16.475
For…

00:49:18.143 --> 00:49:19.811
not forgetting me and watching over me.

00:49:22.397 --> 00:49:23.815
I truly thank you.

00:49:59.893 --> 00:50:01.478
What are you doing there?

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:07.859
I asked what you were all doing.

00:50:08.527 --> 00:50:13.114
Why are you here this late at night?

00:50:16.785 --> 00:50:19.788
If the door was locked,

00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:23.041
you could have used your phone
and called someone.

00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:25.502
So why were you two doing something

00:50:26.211 --> 00:50:27.587
all secretive in there?

00:50:33.969 --> 00:50:37.889
My phone battery died.

00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:43.186
Hello.

00:50:46.815 --> 00:50:47.858
What?

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.740
You're here? Over here.

00:51:00.412 --> 00:51:02.038
-Is this him?
-Yes.

00:51:02.956 --> 00:51:04.624
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:06.126
Please, have a seat.

00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:10.922
After you visited last time,

00:51:11.006 --> 00:51:13.258
I thought maybe there was something
I could do to help.

00:51:13.842 --> 00:51:16.219
So I went around and talked
to every staff member

00:51:16.303 --> 00:51:17.929
who worked the day Jae-hee stayed here.

00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:22.809
And he said he heard
something strange that day.

00:51:23.977 --> 00:51:25.770
Something strange?

00:51:25.854 --> 00:51:28.690
Yes. That day,

00:51:28.773 --> 00:51:30.483
I went in to clean…

00:51:30.567 --> 00:51:33.486
What good is it to you knowing where I am?

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:36.031
Don't pretend you care now.

00:51:36.656 --> 00:51:39.951
I heard someone talking on the phone.

00:51:40.535 --> 00:51:41.661
Me too.

00:51:42.996 --> 00:51:44.539
I need time too!

00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:47.292
So please, just leave me alone.

00:51:48.585 --> 00:51:50.545
Stop coming to find me!

00:51:51.296 --> 00:51:53.173
He was really worked up.

00:51:54.341 --> 00:51:57.677
I didn't want to get mixed up in anything,

00:51:57.761 --> 00:51:59.554
so I gave the police a short statement.

00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:03.433
She really pestered me.

00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:07.354
Did you happen to hear
what he said on the call?

00:52:07.437 --> 00:52:11.858
I'm not one to meddle
in other people's business,

00:52:11.942 --> 00:52:14.069
so I didn't listen closely.

00:52:14.152 --> 00:52:18.573
But he was yelling at someone he called
the CEO or something.

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.619
The CEO?

00:52:23.578 --> 00:52:25.372
He kept saying, "CEO,"

00:52:25.455 --> 00:52:26.957
and asking

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.501
what good it was for them
to know where he was.

00:52:29.584 --> 00:52:32.212
Telling them not to come.

00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:34.839
So I figured

00:52:34.923 --> 00:52:38.385
maybe it was just
some kind of lovers' quarrel.

00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:53.942
When I went to the police station

00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:55.568
for Jae-hee's witness interview,

00:52:55.652 --> 00:52:57.696
the detective told me clearly that

00:52:57.779 --> 00:53:00.198
the CEO talked to Choi Jae-hee,

00:53:00.281 --> 00:53:02.909
but claimed the call was nothing special
and they just hung up.

00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:06.913
Then he lied about the call?

00:53:08.289 --> 00:53:09.374
Why would he do that?

00:53:18.758 --> 00:53:22.387
Attorney Hwang had been digging around.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.056
Apparently, sometime
before Kang Woo-seong's murder,

00:53:26.141 --> 00:53:27.600
Gold Boys' contract

00:53:27.684 --> 00:53:31.813
was being quietly re-examined
by their legal team.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.025
What they focused on the most

00:53:35.108 --> 00:53:37.861
was the clause about breach of trust.

00:53:37.944 --> 00:53:41.489
As if someone in the group
was going to betray them and they knew it.

00:53:44.034 --> 00:53:48.121
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.293
Before that,

00:53:54.836 --> 00:53:57.172
there's something you need to know.

00:53:58.673 --> 00:54:00.216
Something very important.

00:54:03.928 --> 00:54:05.430
CHANGES IN PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT LA-IK

00:54:05.513 --> 00:54:08.475
This shows public opinion
based on SNS and online reactions.

00:54:08.558 --> 00:54:10.602
POSITIVE 68%, NEGATIVE 32%

00:54:10.685 --> 00:54:14.481
Support for Do La-ik's return is steadily
increasing, especially among the fandom.

00:54:14.564 --> 00:54:15.690
But before that,

00:54:15.774 --> 00:54:18.359
we need to closely examine
how the public feels

00:54:18.443 --> 00:54:19.986
about Kang Woo-seong and Choi Jae-hee.

00:54:24.032 --> 00:54:25.158
Sir?

00:54:28.119 --> 00:54:29.204
Sir?

00:54:34.167 --> 00:54:37.462
Get a clear response guide ready
for any questions related to the case.

00:54:38.588 --> 00:54:40.840
Adjust it carefully, so we can avoid

00:54:41.883 --> 00:54:45.345
-any unnecessary controversy.
-Yes sir.

00:54:54.521 --> 00:54:57.857
I can't believe this. Why would Woo-seong?

00:54:59.692 --> 00:55:02.654
I couldn't believe it either.
That's why I kept it from you,

00:55:02.737 --> 00:55:05.406
at least until I understood
the whole situation.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:07.450
I worried it would be too much for you.

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:09.994
So if you're right

00:55:10.078 --> 00:55:12.080
and Woo-seong really did the tampering…

00:55:12.163 --> 00:55:14.457
Then the whole context
of the case changes.

00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:17.710
CEO Geum Bo-sang knew all of this.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:25.593
He tried to handle the contract issue
in complete secrecy.

00:55:27.345 --> 00:55:29.264
But Jae-hee became a variable.

00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:32.517
I'm sure that's why he lied to the police

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.394
about the phone call.

00:55:35.228 --> 00:55:36.688
Probably.

00:55:37.689 --> 00:55:38.982
And to know for sure…

00:55:41.234 --> 00:55:42.861
We have to ask him ourselves.

00:55:44.612 --> 00:55:45.697
So…

00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:48.616
you came here to confirm that?

00:55:53.538 --> 00:55:57.000
I was told you testified to the police

00:55:57.083 --> 00:56:00.670
that your call with Jae-hee
was nothing special.

00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:03.173
But that day,

00:56:03.256 --> 00:56:06.301
a witness near the scene said

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.596
he heard him repeating
the words "CEO" several times,

00:56:09.679 --> 00:56:12.056
and that the two of you
sounded like you were arguing.

00:56:15.894 --> 00:56:19.939
Can we ask what
you actually talked about that night?

00:56:23.484 --> 00:56:26.487
Are you suspecting me?

00:56:28.531 --> 00:56:31.117
Woo-seong talked to you.
And so did Jae-hee.

00:56:32.076 --> 00:56:34.370
And after those calls,
you know better what happened.

00:56:36.915 --> 00:56:39.334
Answer me. What did you talk about

00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:41.461
with Woo-seong, and with Jae-hee?

00:56:43.296 --> 00:56:45.798
Why were you on the phone
with Woo-seong so late?

00:56:46.382 --> 00:56:48.426
And why didn't you tell me
you talked to Jae-hee?

00:56:49.677 --> 00:56:50.678
If I had told you,

00:56:52.222 --> 00:56:54.224
too many people would've gotten hurt.

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.770
Especially you, La-ik.

00:56:59.729 --> 00:57:01.606
You would have been hurt the most.

00:57:03.441 --> 00:57:04.901
That's why I hid it.

00:57:05.693 --> 00:57:06.611
What?

00:57:06.694 --> 00:57:11.157
You think you know everything
about Woo-seong, don't you?

00:57:14.077 --> 00:57:15.245
What are you talking about?

00:57:16.204 --> 00:57:17.914
I'm asking you

00:57:17.997 --> 00:57:20.875
if you're ready to face the truth,
whatever it is.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.463
Some truths

00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:30.718
come with pain.

00:57:32.512 --> 00:57:33.346
So much…

00:57:35.139 --> 00:57:37.433
that you'll wish you never knew them.

00:57:41.646 --> 00:57:43.189
One last time,

00:57:45.692 --> 00:57:46.901
can you really…

00:57:48.278 --> 00:57:50.572
handle the truth?

00:58:03.918 --> 00:58:05.086
Tell me.

00:58:06.629 --> 00:58:08.715
What are you hiding?

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:10.902
What do you think would happen
if La-ik found out?

00:59:11.527 --> 00:59:14.197
I'd want to kill you.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.200
It's okay to be sad.

00:59:17.283 --> 00:59:19.827
We can start over from the beginning.

00:59:19.911 --> 00:59:22.830
Jae-hee would never kill himself.

00:59:23.623 --> 00:59:25.375
Step back cleanly.

00:59:25.458 --> 00:59:26.626
Just be grateful.

00:59:26.709 --> 00:59:28.044
That's it.

00:59:28.127 --> 00:59:31.798
Having these feelings right now,
I think I must be crazy.

00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:34.467
My feelings just won't stop.

00:59:35.593 --> 00:59:40.598
