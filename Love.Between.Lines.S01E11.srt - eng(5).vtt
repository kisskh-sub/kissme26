00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.040
Develop it further according to the plan

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.100
we just discussed.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.210
Sure, Mr. Xiao.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.680
Mr. Xiao,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240
this needs your signature.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.800
Okay.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.560
Mr. Xiao,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.150
this proposal needs your confirmation
as well.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.590
Sure.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.230
The closing period

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.560
will be a difficult one.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.170
I'll give everyone a break

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.620
after the design competition concludes.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.020
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
-Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.810
I was worried...

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.430
that your injured hand

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.800
would affect our progress.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.750
I didn't expect you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.310
to be so efficient.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.590
So, Xiaorou,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.360
that slap guy really got fired.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.430
Slap guy?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.970
What a nickname.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.480
Mr. Gong didn't mention this at the store?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.320
He never mentioned it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.260
He does good deeds without seeking credit.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.350
But Xiaorou,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.420
you're amazing.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.270
If I encountered someone like that,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.530
I'd be scared to death.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.120
Did you tell Guangming about this?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.830
I heard that guy was brought

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.850
to the club by him.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.680
I didn't.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.640
Didn't you add him

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.170
on WeChat at the karaoke room last time?

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.230
Don't you dare tell him either,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.890
or I'll take all of these away.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.550
What is he not supposed to say?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.210
Weren't you supposed
to be back only at night?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.560
That meeting was boring,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
so I slipped away.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.870
Thanks.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.310
What were you two secretly talking about?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.400
I gave him

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.240
the most expensive beans

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.120
at no extra charge,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.020
so I told him not to
tell others in the shop.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
Yes, Guangming.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.500
I can't say that.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.840
Otherwise I wouldn't get
such perks in the future.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.770
I'm leaving now.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.560
Come around when you're free.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.490
What are you looking at?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.430
There were too many people
at the karaoke that day,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.490
so I didn't notice.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.930
Li Yue is quite handsome.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.680
Well,
he is studying to be an actor after all.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.120
Just because he's handsome,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.720
you switch to the most expensive beans
for him?

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.930
Why else?

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.740
For his acting skills?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.720
What are you thinking?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.080
He's just a kid who hasn't even graduated.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.830
I thought you went to Jinshan—

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.830
they don't produce lemons, do they?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.159
Why so sour?

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.270
Have some lemons.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.120
What is it?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.360
This is from
the most famous dessert shop in Jinshan.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.310
I brought it back especially for you.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.240
See if it inspires you.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.640
You must've queued for really long!

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.490
It's fine.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.860
I can slip away
from the conference

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.720
for a few hours.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.070
How is it?

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.410
It's delicious.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760
By the way, honey.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.560
Can you come with me next week

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.620
to a class reunion?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.890
That's so sudden.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.680
I ran into Cheng Han at the conference.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.510
He said he's been wanting to organize
this reunion for a long time.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.910
He's insisting that I go.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.240
Okay.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.840
Great.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.630
Zhan Jie is awake.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.380
I need to get back to the office.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.390
About the reunion,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.520
we have a deal, right?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.180
Be careful.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.680
Just brought this back from abroad.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.880
It's the last bottle.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.550
To have you open up your collection,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.890
looks like the steel order went smoothly.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.350
It's thanks to your help.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.630
But this trip

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.640
has brought a bigger reward.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.630
For the past two years,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.830
that steel mill director

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.750
you kept asking me about,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.510
I finally got news of him.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.800
Unfortunately,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.260
he's no longer around.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.280
According to his daughter,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.800
after the Xincheng Stadium incident,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.070
their steel mill was severely impacted.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.430
It went bankrupt shortly after.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.690
Less than two years after moving abroad,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.750
he passed away

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.000
from illness.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.840
No wonder
we couldn't find him all these years.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.640
You've been looking for him all this time—

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.870
why?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.850
You don't owe him money, do you?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.270
Uncle Xu.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.360
That consent form
couldn't have been signed by my father.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.560
The stadium collapse wasn't his fault.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.600
Yu.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.950
I worked with your father
for many years.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.800
I also believe

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.560
there's something suspicious about him
signing that consent form.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.950
With his professional expertise,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.120
he definitely would have noticed

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.780
something's off
with the hardness of the steel.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.510
But

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.040
the case has been closed for so long now.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.270
That consent form

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.430
was indeed signed
by your father's own hand.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.720
What you just said

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.230
has no evidence to back it up.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.590
I'll definitely find it.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.800
Help me look for the people

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.200
who worked with him.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.360
Some things

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.560
must be thoroughly investigated.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.220
Mr. Xiao.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.340
Why did you leave the company first?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.870
Are you already home?

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.310
No,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.380
I'm at a bar.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.260
Take the car back after you finish work.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.750
The doctor said you shouldn't drink
while your injury is still healing.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.220
I already...

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.140
Old Mr. Li that lives in the lane

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.380
also had a fracture before.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.140
He didn't listen to the doctor

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.950
and drank,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.480
so his condition got worse.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.550
I got it.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.010
No, thanks.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.270
Mr. Xiao.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.950
Mr. Xiao?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.070
I brought you something.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.750
What is it?

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.390
You can't eat seafood
if your hand is injured.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.580
So I brought you a substitute.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.860
Crab shell pastries.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.920
You don't know what crab shell pastries are?

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.910
Green onion, seaweed,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.340
sugar, and red bean.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.830
See which flavor you like.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.760
Can you tell them apart?

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.220
I think...

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.270
I can't.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.220
I prepared a gift for you too.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.590
One final revision.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.560
You always say "final revision."

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.670
What's going on?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.790
Mr. Wang!

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.920
You're always so loud?

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.270
What about it?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.360
The power keeps going out.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.230
At this frequency,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.700
there must be a problem
with the circuit itself.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.900
Let's go check it out.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.550
Hu, you're here!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.100
Can you help us take a look?

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.340
Didn't you study architecture in college?

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.980
You must know electricity.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.700
Actually...

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.460
-Yeah.
-I...

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.100
Hu,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.070
you're a professional.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.620
Please help us.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.580
I need to follow along
with the TV to learn

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.610
the Jia Mu Si Aerobics.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.250
Exactly.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.620
Okay, I'll try.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.240
Let me do it.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.020
No need.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.010
I can handle it.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.250
I'll try.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.670
Um...

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.800
What's happening?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.740
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.820
-Why is it out again?
-It's out again.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.340
These are all tight.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.190
Well...

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.790
Are you sure
as someone who studied architecture,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.520
you also understand circuits?

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.950
Of course.
I even have an electrician's license.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.980
Don't question
your landlord if you can't help.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.100
I wouldn't dare. Take your time, landlord.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.700
Everyone's got some certificate
these days.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.340
Here. The insulation is broken.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.790
It's probably a short circuit.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.740
That's our Hu for you. So professional.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.270
She finds out the problems so quickly.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.340
What should we do now?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.340
Do we still need to find a repairman?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.950
I already called the building manager.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.740
They said

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.140
the technician won't come until tomorrow.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.030
I thought you were

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.620
on good terms with the manager.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.620
Why can't you get them to come today?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.390
Fine.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:08.880
Well,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.460
does anyone have insulated gloves?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.270
I can wear the gloves,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.030
wrap it up with electrical tape,

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.860
and then cover it with a plastic bag
as a temporary fix.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.670
We can wait for the technician tomorrow.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.860
I have them. I'll go get them.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.150
Okay. Go get it.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.790
Hurry up!

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.430
Hu Xiu.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.880
I think the problem is here.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.070
The wiring looks fine.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.580
The insulation is peeling off.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.100
The covering is damaged,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.070
but it's minor,

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.070
not enough to cause a short circuit.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.550
This part isn't damaged at all,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.340
all the more it wouldn't have caused
the short circuit.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.340
I got them!

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.620
The gloves are here.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.100
Thank you.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.460
-Here's the tape.
-Let me try.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.550
You stew meat every single day,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.070
causing the short circuits,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.800
but have all the things needed.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.740
Why isn't it working yet?

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.820
What's going on?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.910
Let me check again.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.110
This cable is fine.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.460
It's back.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.790
Great.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.120
We have to count on young people
nowadays.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.700
Thank you.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.740
You're welcome.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.790
I'll go back to my class now,

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.150
my Jia Mu Si Aerobics.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.950
Young people are really something.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.500
Mr. Xiao.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.790
Your hand is healed?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.100
Hey.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.100
Don't.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.550
Don't.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.550
Please, don't.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.180
If you push harder,
my old injury will flare up.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.450
Look,

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.840
I think some of my strength is back now.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.700
Stop pretending.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.270
You're completely healed.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.640
Yet you're still ordering me around.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.700
How can you call that ordering you around?

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.500
I drive and wash the car.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.980
I serve you in the day

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.740
and work overtime drawing plans at night.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.910
These are all because of
your injured hand.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.790
Fine, it's not ordering me around—

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.190
it's playing the victim.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.310
Playing the victim is one thing.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.310
Your hand was injured

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.510
and that was my fault,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.410
but isn't it too much to hide that
you've recovered?

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.550
It is.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.070
So,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.740
who's driving tomorrow, you or me?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.740
Me.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:53.980
Then,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.790
who's drawing these plans, you or me?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.430
You.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.460
After all,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.520
you're improving.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.620
Indeed.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.720
There's improvement.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.150
So sudden?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:51.950
Regard Café

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.210
hasn't launched a new cake in a while now.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.640
I just suddenly got inspired.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.270
Hu Xiu.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.720
Mr. Xiao is looking for you.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.590
Wh-What happened?

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.290
I can't say much.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.040
You'll know when you get there.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.070
Anyway,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.550
good luck.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.030
Mr. Xiao.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.340
Come in.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:48.670
Mr. Xiao.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.310
I-I was only slacking off
for a little while just now.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.310
I was working hard
on the drawings the rest of the time.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.800
It's not about that?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.390
Then...

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.460
It's because I sneaked a bun

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.070
in your car

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.310
before you came down in the morning?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.990
I opened the window
for ventilation immediately.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.800
What did Sun Yifei tell you?

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.580
Nothing much.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.840
He just told me good luck.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.390
You thought I'd retaliate?

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.570
Mr. Xiao, you're not that kind of person.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.500
So...

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.740
why did you call me in?

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.390
I discussed with Ms. Zhou
and several designers,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.450
and we decided that

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.810
for the Lemon project,

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.390
we'll give you a designer credit.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.030
Of course,
your name will be at the very end.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.160
Can you accept that?

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.190
Yes,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.250
of course I can.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.820
Everyone did more work than I did.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.340
I'm just the one enjoying the shade
under the tree.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.940
All right,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.530
that's all. You can go now.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.330
Th-That's it?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:52.990
What else?

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.790
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
I shall take my leave.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.530
Anything else?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.030
Mr. Xiao,

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.089
will you be home tomorrow afternoon?

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.420
I want to treat you to a meal.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.349
I heard the new restaurant
at the lane entrance

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.260
is quite good.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.540
You're being nice for no good reason.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.430
I'm just showing my gratitude.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.430
Look at you.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.260
Your hand got hurt because of me.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.020
But you didn't deduct my money
and shared the rent with me.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.500
Now you're allowing me
to hitch your ride to work,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.099
and now you're giving me credit
on the project.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.210
When you put it that way,

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:31.900
indeed,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.380
I should accept this meal.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.390
Send me the address.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.120
What time tomorrow afternoon?

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.220
As for the time,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.420
I haven't set one yet.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.190
Mr. Xiao,

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.910
tomorrow is Saturday anyway.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.190
If you're home,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.870
you can come down

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.070
after I holler at you.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.000
I might not be at home then.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.910
You're either in the lane
or at the company.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.300
At most, you might work part-time
at the murder mystery game place.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.630
Where else would you go?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.110
What I mean is,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.390
just wait for my message.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.650
So it's settled, okay?

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500
You're done with your drawing?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.060
I came to bring you this.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.150
The attic space is limited.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.390
Given how one would go in and out,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.830
this is your path to the bed

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.510
and where you're most likely
to hit your head.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.000
With something this eye-catching here,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.060
you'll definitely notice it, right?

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.460
Mr. Xiao,

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.560
you need to protect that head of yours

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.610
or how else are we going to win?

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.590
[Aunt]

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.220
Auntie.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.630
Xiu,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.690
have you been busy?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.020
Not too bad.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.740
What's up? Why the sudden call?

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.980
Did your dad tell you

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.390
about the blind date?

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.230
He mentioned it.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.780
Tomorrow is Saturday.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.980
That young man

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.630
wants to meet you.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.350
Where should you meet?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.910
Best if it's afternoon,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.020
so you can have dinner together.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.740
Auntie, I've told my dad about this.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.000
Let's forget it.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.700
You told him that?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.060
Your father didn't mention it to me.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.590
Look,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.950
how am I supposed to
explain this to them now?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.700
No.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.620
I have to talk to your father.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.270
Auntie,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.960
don't bother my dad.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:54.430
He's probably stressed out lately.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.590
Forget it. Send me that guy's WeChat.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.260
Don't be late, then.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.540
I know.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.780
I'll be there on time.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:02.700
Okay.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.220
Xiao.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.630
Want to pick up a shift tomorrow?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740
It's been a while.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.470
I'm not free.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.670
Why? Got a date?

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.870
I did,

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.910
but now it's probably canceled.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.020
So you got stood up?

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.060
What kind of client

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.260
would dare to do that?

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.210
Anyway, come over if you're free.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.140
Forget it.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.880
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.630
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.280
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.110
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.740
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.220
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.220
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.880
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.220
Mr. Xiao,

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.190
is your head okay?

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.930
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.870
Shut up!

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.950
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.720
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.200
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.620
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.670
Mr. Xiao,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.250
twist its ears
and it will stop laughing at you.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.920
Haha! Idiot! Idiot

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.570
Haha! Id—

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.460
I'm waiting for you.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.020
You...

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.110
Well,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.060
I can only go out when you get there.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.830
I don't even dare to face him now.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.030
I'm afraid he'll ask when I'm going out.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.640
So can you give me a definite time

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.160
you'll get there.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.670
I finished my work ages ago.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.630
It's the delivery guy
who hasn't shown up yet.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.030
I've already rushed him.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.870
Zhao.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.060
If you want to start this new business,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.540
you need more practice.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.080
That's why I'm using you for practice.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.390
My husband who's been missing all morning

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.150
has finally replied to my message.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.060
He's so busy?

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.360
Yes, we never see each other these days.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.110
We're almost like roommates now
instead of spouses.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.700
I'll get cracking.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.590
I've got to go.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.540
Your coffee.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.670
This isn't mine.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.630
I'll order now.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:15.870
Mr. Pei.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.770
I'm sorry.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.440
Good afternoon, Ms. Zhao.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.300
Mr. Pei, what would you like to have?

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.950
I'll have an iced Americano.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.950
Sure.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.430
Your place has quite a unique decor.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.870
Yes.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.350
Mr. Pei,
you didn't come in to get a coffee

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.190
because you just happened to pass by,
did you?

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.910
I had some business
around this industrial park.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.260
You mentioned in your WeChat

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.590
that you opened a café here,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.920
so I thought I'd drop by.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:44.890
Oh, and congratulations.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.080
I heard the car issue was resolved.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.040
Thank you so much for your help last time.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.390
Is your car fixed?

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.740
And has the insurance claim
been processed?

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.430
It's fixed.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.740
That's good.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.150
I'll make your coffee first.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.540
Go ahead.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.070
Okay, please wait a moment.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.190
I just heard you on the phone.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.700
You're already married?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.430
I got married right after college.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.150
That's quite rare.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.780
Most young people nowadays

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.240
don't want to marry early.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.910
Like Ms. Hu.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.350
She's probably part of that majority.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.150
Xiu?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.590
She's single.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.390
Boss,

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.520
you have a delivery order for cake?

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.870
You're finally here.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.460
No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.460
Hu Xiu, right?

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.670
Yes, that's right. It's over there.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.190
Here,

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.740
this is it.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.430
[Thank you, Mr. Xiao.]

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.060
Take it carefully.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:42.670
Thanks.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.150
Go to No. 27, Lane 9, Yanhua Road.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.190
Mr. Xiao,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.060
could you send me that rendering

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.590
you took for optimization last time?

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.990
It's on my work computer.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.110
That's fine.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.830
Give it to me on Monday.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.230
I can go to the office now.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.230
Leaving without saying anything.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.180
How rude.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:04.720
Young man,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.450
heading out?

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.500
Yes.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.550
I'm free.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.260
Go ahead.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.350
Why is he here?

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.150
Hello, Ms. Hu.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.700
I'm not sure which building it is.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.150
Well,

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.540
do you see number 27?

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.060
It's here.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.630
I see it.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.980
Go up to the second floor
using these stairs.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.830
Okay.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.670
Your cake.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.270
Thank you.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.150
Mr. Xiao,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.110
we can get ready to leave now.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:58.870
Mr. Xiao?

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.350
Mr. Xiao?

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.670
Mr. Xiao?

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.670
I'm coming in.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.060
Mr. Xiao.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:22.910
He's not here?

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.830
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is busy now.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.970
Please try—

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060
How rude.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.910
I was just a little late.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.670
Tell me,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.430
if a man and woman
aren't in a relationship,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.630
but live together,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.420
what could be the reason?

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.270
It's actually quite common.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.990
They could be roommates.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.020
However,

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.390
if we're talking about Xiao Zhiyu,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.120
that possibility is ruled out.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.300
He's likely pursuing
his female subordinate.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500
Go check

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.870
if he lives here,

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.220
and if so,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.540
when he moved in.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.110
Okay.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.060
Sorry,
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.390
Please try again later. Sorry—

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:38.670
Never mind.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.500
I was planning

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.260
to treat you to a nice meal.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.830
I'll just eat by myself.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.540
Mr. Xiao.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.720
What a coincidence.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.480
How convenient for you.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.430
You don't even bother
looking for another location.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.070
Your date didn't show up?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.970
What are you talking about?

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.020
Mr. Xiao, I admit

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.150
I left a bit late today.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.010
It was my fault.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.150
But that's no reason to stand me up.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.460
If you had something to do, fine,

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.870
but you're already eating here.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.930
What's this about?

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.610
You have the nerve to blame me?

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.730
Weren't you meeting some blind date?

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.700
Mr. Xiao,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.980
eavesdropping on others' conversations

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.390
isn't a good habit.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.980
That was a shared area.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.060
Besides,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.150
you were the one
who put it on loudspeaker.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.280
You said things like

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.400
you couldn't get out
of a blind date set up by relatives.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.460
I understand.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.980
I had things to do this afternoon too.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.110
I went to the office.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.870
But shouldn't you

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.200
have told me in advance?

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.460
I didn't tell you in advance

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.320
because I wanted to surprise you.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.430
Surprise me?

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.960
It's quite a surprise.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.540
Stop looking.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.200
The blind date didn't show up.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.040
Auntie,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.700
don't bother my dad.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.150
He's probably stressed out lately.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.730
Forget it. Send me that guy's WeChat.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.780
Also,

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.980
next month
is our baby's first birthday party.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.220
I've sent you the address.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.920
Don't run off to work overtime again

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.020
like you did last time
at the full-month celebration.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.220
Okay, I'll definitely be there on time.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:03.780
Hello.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.950
I'm Hu Xiu.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.020
Aunt Xiuying introduced me.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.350
I'm sorry,

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.890
I can't meet you tomorrow.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.700
But in the afternoon,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.300
weren't you waiting for someone
to pick you up?

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.540
I was waiting for the delivery guy.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.260
My friend is mainly a barista.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.060
She doesn't usually make desserts.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.590
The ingredients will only arrive at noon.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.110
She's not sure when she'll finish.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.910
I'm not sure when I can leave.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.290
So it turned
into this whole misunderstanding.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.420
Waiter.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.830
Take a look
and see what you'd like to eat.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:50.950
This one,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.740
this and this.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.550
I'll have all of these.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.180
Thank you.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.830
Mr. Xiao,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.830
can I ask you something?

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.740
Go ahead.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.700
If you suspected I was standing you up,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.460
why didn't you confirm with me beforehand?

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.430
There was nothing to confirm.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:14.500
I'm not that free.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.220
You thought

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.830
I stood you up,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.890
yet you still sat here and had dinner.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.950
Mr. Xiao,

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.670
you actually
wanted to have this meal too, didn't you?

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.870
But you were too embarrassed to show it,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.540
so you didn't contact me first.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.020
That's right.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.350
It's rare for this somebody
to treat me to a meal.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.910
If I seemed too eager,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.480
I was afraid she'd think

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.060
her boss is taking advantage

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.660
and trying to get a free meal.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.110
Excuse me.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.030
Don't worry.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.950
This meal

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.390
is to thank you.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.980
Whatever you say goes.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.300
Do we eat the cake now?

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.190
What else?

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.590
If we eat dinner first,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.120
we won't have room for cake.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.720
No need for the candles.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.240
How can you make wishes without candles?

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.030
Mr. Xiao,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.630
don't you have anything special

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.800
you absolutely want to come true?

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.150
Then I'll go ahead.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.230
My first wish:

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.080
I hope we don't have to revise
the drawings again.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.290
My second wish:

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.300
I hope the design competition

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.220
will be successful and go smoothly.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.300
My third wish...

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.100
Why don't you make a wish?

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.440
What wish did you make?

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.350
I'm not telling you.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:24.949
It won't come true if I say it.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.710
Never mind.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.639
If you're not making a wish,
just blow out the candle.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.690

how will you fulfill your third wish?

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.660
It's Saturday today.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.810

only when we resolve our internal issues,

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.350
can we face external challenges
together.

How will you get back, then?

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.090

I'll take a taxi.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.540
I'm going now.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.100
Go ahead.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.270
Xiu!

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.020
Mom.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.350
Why are you here?

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.020
Come in, come in.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.430
Your father and I

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.020
were planning to
bring you some food tomorrow.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.270
I was about to text you

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.330
when you showed up.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.200
I'll pack up some dishes from the kitchen.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:17.540
Dad,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.100
last time you came to see me,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.310
you went down and came back up—

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.390
what did you want to tell me?

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.980
Your aunt's little baby

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.840
is having a first birthday party.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.910
You didn't come all this way

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.640
just to ask about that, did you?

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.660
No.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.830
I have good news to share

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.430
with you both.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.410
Our firm

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.770
is currently working on

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.310
a design competition for a hotel project.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.750
It's quite a big project.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.810
When it concludes,

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.110
I'll be credited

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.210
as the designer.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.980
Then you must win.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.880
Dad.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:19.870
Xiu.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.100
Ever since

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.140
I injured this leg

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.870
of mine,

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.590
I've always thought

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.750
that in this life,

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.350
I won't be able to walk properly anymore.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.350
But I never expected

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.670
that I would end up holding you back...

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:54.790
Holding you back

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.800
from taking the path you wanted to.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.540
Dad, I...

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.870
All right, all right.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:03.910
Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.230
Take these dishes back with you

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.830
and head home early.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.710
Let me know when you win

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.700
the project.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.660
Dad, I've barely sat down

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.620
and you're already sending me away?

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.580
That's because if you don't leave soon,

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.180
your father
won't be able to hold back anymore.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.620
Before I came, my boss told me

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.830
it's Saturday today
and I don't have to work tomorrow.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.390
It's the perfect time to visit you both.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.430
What does that mean?

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:32.580
It means

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.040
I can cry, make a scene,
or even threaten dramatically.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.230
If it's not resolved,
we can keep talking.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.890
It's okay if we get emotional.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.140
I don't have work tomorrow anyway,

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.540
so I have a whole day
to process everything.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:45.870
But,

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.830
he probably doesn't know

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.710
that my parents are

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.500
the most reasonable people

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.790
in the world.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:53.910
They understand

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.720
everything right away.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.420
Your boss seems quite interesting though.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:02.870
I didn't embarrass myself

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.530
when I met him last time, did I?

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.910
No.

Wait, wait.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.530
Speaking of

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.540
your boss,

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.660
there are many people

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.500
who rent instead of buying
when they're starting

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.140
their businesses.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:14.870
But

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.160
to be living in that

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:17.350

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.500
is really unusual.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.950
Is he reliable?

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.580
Of course he is.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.980
This guy,

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.060
at first glance,

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.060
his personality may seem ordinary.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.390
But after spending time with him,
you'll find

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.790
he's actually quite easy
to get along with.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.230
He's kinda similar

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.020
