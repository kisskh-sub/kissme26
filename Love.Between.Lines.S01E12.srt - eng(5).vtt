[Love Between Lines]

[Episode 12] Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.120
So,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.370
he only moved into the lane 2 months ago?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.350
Yes.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
So it's really related to
Lyman's Design Competition.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.060
It's related to Lyman?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560
Two months ago,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.640
right when Lyman released the news

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850
about the Design Competition.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.780
He never does anything without purpose.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.190
Are you saying

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.940
they are planning
a lane-style hotel this time?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.820
But the lane theme is nothing new.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.220
Traditional Jiangsu and Zhejiang buildings

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.180
are everywhere.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.079
If he's doing this,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.030
there must be something I don't know

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.960
that can increase his chances of winning.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.710
It's a pity...

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
we don't have another Jiang Tianyi.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:51.590
No.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.710
I-I mean,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.230
the Design Competition is coming soon.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.680
Even if we knew

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.870
what they are planning,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.670
it would be...

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.870
Notify everyone.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.370
Meeting in 10 minutes.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.710
The building form
emphasizes vertical lines,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.120
with the top gradually receding inward,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.400
creating a tall and elegant presence.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.320
The design stresses symmetry,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.100
proportion, and scale,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.840
with a focus on luxurious decoration

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.200
and a three-part composition

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
in its architectural composition.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.430
Well,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.320
that concludes my presentation.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.950
Mr. Pei.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.190
Mr. Pei,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.190
do you think

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.800
there is anything in our current proposal

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.130
that needs adjustment?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.410
Let's leave it for now.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.710
Mr. Pei,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.400
you dismissed everyone.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.300
Do you already have a plan?

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.250
Go arrange an interview for me

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.530
within the next couple of days.

Come on, Hu,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.230
have a "drink."

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.330
Thank you, Sun.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.159
Here, Zhuang. Hand these out to everyone.

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.750
Thank you, Sun.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.390
-Thank you, Sun.
-Thank you, Sun.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.320
-You're welcome.
-Thank you, Sun.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.430
Everyone,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.680
once we get through tonight

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.750
and confirm there
are no issues with the design,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.870
we can submit it.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.720
Hang in there.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.920
The holiday is just around the corner.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.950
Let's keep up the good work, shall we?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.560
Okay! Let's do it!

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720
Come here! Something bad happened!

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.000
Who is this?

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.700
What's going on?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.720
Ms. Zhou,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.630
Mr. Xiao.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.550
That's right.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.590
All the architects at Zhuling

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.280
have a say in their work.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.040
In every project,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.360
I want them to be creators,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.070
not just

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.750
a group of operators working to meet

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.010
the client's demands.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.240
Speaking of clients,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.270
Zhuling and Yueheng have always maintained

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.870
a good working relationship.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.920
I hear there's something new
coming up soon.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.630
Can you give us a hint

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.360
in this exclusive interview?

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.830
Yueheng Group and Zhuling are old friends.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.560
We've collaborated
on quite a few projects,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.360
mostly in a modern style.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.720
But this time, we are planning a hotel project

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.310
featuring Shanghai cultural elements.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.490
Can you be a bit more specific?

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.070
That's a business secret.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.070
Just kidding.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.640
What I can say for now

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.710
is that we'll use Shanghai's
stone-doorframe houses

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.240
as the main design element.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.630
My father and I...

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.660
Mr. Xiao,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.610
isn't this similar to our idea?

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.720
Exactly.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.800
Why did Zhuling suddenly come up

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.720
with this?

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.070
Mr. Xiao.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.270
Let's have a meeting.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.830
Let's hear everyone's thoughts first.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.800
Mr. Xiao,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.630
Ms. Zhou,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.920
let me share my opinion first.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.240
I have full confidence

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.480
in our design.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.750
Even if we're using the same elements,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.150
our plan will definitely outshine theirs.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.120
As for

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.190
changing our plan at the last minute,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.510
quality aside,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.180
whether we can finish it in time is already a question.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.890
Yifei,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.520
even the most secret project

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
can't stay completely under wraps.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.310
When have you ever heard
that Yueheng Group

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.270
is developing

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.270
a Shanghai-cultural themed hotel?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.050
If we were at the competition—

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.590
never mind just Zhuling—

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.510
even if all the companies presented proposals

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.630
with stone-doorframe house elements,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.430
we wouldn't be afraid
of direct competition.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.750
But the problem now

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.600
is that right before the competition,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.920
Zhuling suddenly claimed

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.040
to be preparing

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.430
this so-called special project,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.270
and they even emphasized

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.470
that it would be implemented very soon.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.320
That means

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.120
no matter how good our proposal is

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.120
or how competitive the details are,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.020
Lyman won't buy it.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.040
Because in their eyes,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.870
no matter how we design this lane-style hotel,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.320
we'll just be copying someone else's idea.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.000
So this project mentioned in the interview

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.800
won't actually be implemented.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.140
Whether it'll be implemented or not,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.670
the impact has already
fallen squarely on us.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.600
Thank you for your hard work overtime lately.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.000
Go back and get some rest.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.280
Meeting adjourned.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.750
The scallions have grown.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.610
Come back and eat Yanduxian soup.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.000
Those flowers seem beyond saving.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.929
Could you buy some plant nutrients?

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:40.809
It's urgent.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.080
Mr. Xiao,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.950
now you really have to come back.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.060
Do you remember the old lady
who sells hydrogen balloons

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.200
at the lane entrance?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.750
She wasn't paying attention today and all the balloons flew off

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.390
and got stuck on our roof.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.360
I have to climb up
through the skylight in your room

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.760
to help her get them down.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.980
When are you coming back?

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.750
She's worried sick.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.240
You lied to me?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.170
If I hadn't pulled this trick,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.550
you could've stayed gone

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.270
until the Lyman competition.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.140
If I hadn't pulled this trick,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.950
you'd probably lie in your room until the Design Competition.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.160
Stop.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.310
The plant nutrients part
might be an excuse,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.830
but there really is an old lady who's been waiting for you

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.590
to come home.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.790
Cut it out.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.790
If you don't believe me,
go up and see for yourself.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.720
Go by yourself.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.270
The door upstairs isn't locked anyway.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.640
Fine.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.390
I thought you didn't believe me.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.510
I was afraid you'd bring something weird

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.390
into my room again.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.450
That doll last time was scary enough.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.630
Be careful.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.320
It's fine. I'm quite experienced.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.320
Come up.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.630
I had no choice.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.890
Seeing how upset the old lady was,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.350
I bought all her balloons.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.940
I didn't lock the door.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.310
I didn't feel right barging in.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.320
Didn't someone lock themselves

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.250
in the attic to keep me away before?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.600
See?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.310
I rarely lie.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.330
Where are the scallions?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.480
Mr. Xiao,

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.430
authentic Yanduxian soup doesn't need scallions.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.700
Uncle Wang gave this to me.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.390
I traded scallions for it.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.250
Uncle Wang is that generous?

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.650
You got this from him
with just some scallions?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.910
You don't understand.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.440
Scallions are cheap at the market,

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.120
but once the dish is cooking

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.000
and you're just missing that little bit of it,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.200
it's worth a fortune.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.780
Is this how you always find loopholes?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.620
Otherwise,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.420
how could you be drinking this?

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.070
Your friend moved out,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.110
and your parents moved out.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.740
Why are you still here?

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.240
Because...

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.800
it's different.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.960
This place is nothing like
those new buildings

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.370
or apartments.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.600
It's old,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.720
but that's exactly

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.670
why the lanes

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.840
have a sense of story

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.370
and a legendary quality

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.390
that

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.190
new buildings don't.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.550
That second floor

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.660
used to be Granny Wang's home.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.570
I always think she is the most exquisite

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.430
and elegant person I've ever met.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.390
I heard she was a noble lady

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.250
during the Republic of China era.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.840
I once saw her old photos.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.120
She was stunning when she was young.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.380
If you turn into the lane next to us,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.590
at the very end,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.600
you'll see Mr. Wang's secret hideout from when he was a kid.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.630
He told me

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.150
his parents worked in a factory

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.630
and didn't have time to take care of him.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.890
That place used to be his little canteen.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.080
And Dazhong.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.960
Dazhong was amazing at the violin.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.690
He even won awards in Shanghai.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.950
You wouldn't have guessed, would you?

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.960
Of course,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.480
living in the lanes
has many inconveniences.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.270
The spaces are cramped,

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.630
the soundproofing is poor,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.490
and the facilities are outdated.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.870
You don't even need to mention these—

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.400
young people don't like it.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.530
Older people with mobility issues

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.960
who rely on elevators

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.020
aren't suitable to live here either.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.390
Like my dad.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.660
Indeed.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.200
If only there was a building

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.660
that could preserve the history of the lanes

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.120
while fixing

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.310

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.990

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.500
How can anything be so perfect?

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.440
Alright.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.750

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.230

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.360

Hello everyone,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.660
I'm Xiao Zhiyu from Dynamism.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.720
To put it simply,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.110
the concept of the proposal
I'm about to present

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.260
originates from

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.080
stone-doorframe house lanes.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.590
However, I'm not using

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.050
the stone-doorframe house lane aesthetic.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.100
When thinking of lanes,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.130
people often first imagine buildings

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.270
that blend Eastern and Western elements,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.710
shared living spaces,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.230
and the neighborhood warmth that grows from them.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.400
Many also think

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.330
lanes

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.440
are too cramped,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.070
too old,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.900
and inconvenient to live in.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.480
I once wondered about this too.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.400
Today's young people

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.030
are used to smart,
convenient modern apartments.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.270
So why do some

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.960
still choose to live in lanes?

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.050
To find out the reasons,

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.510
I moved into a lane myself.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.880
This experience became

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.680
a very important part of my life,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.750
and I treasure it deeply.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.560
Beyond the richness of daily life,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.800
a certain resident in the lane

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.130
also gave me a lot of inspiration.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.840
She helped me find the answer.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.160
Lanes carry

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.170
the collective memory of old Shanghai residents.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.640
They possess
not only architectural beauty,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.440
but also a unique community life

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.030
that formed over a century ago.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.430

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.010

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.400

Thank you

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.160
to Mr. Xiao Zhiyu

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.510
from Dynamism
for his excellent presentation.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.510
I hereby announce

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.000
that the presentation phase of this design competition

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.930
is now complete.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.510
Next, I invite all the judges
to the conference hall

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.960
for the final evaluation.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.920
Thank you.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.680
Skyline Studio.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.070
Please come in.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.880
The judges have some questions

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.340
they'd like you to answer.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.510
Mr. Wu.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.750
Sorry to keep you waiting. Please.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.440
Here's the thing.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.230
Regarding your company's earlier presentation,

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.690
we are leaning towards...

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.850
I overheard a bit

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.200
in the restroom just now.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.070
They said the scores are deadlocked.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.240
Then it depends on whether Mr. Xie

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.040
is willing to pay for sentiment.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:00.750
Anyway,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.880
we've done our best.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.050
So don't be nervous.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.830
Right.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.240
Yes.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.700
No need to be nervous.
We can't be nervous.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.980
I need to go to the restroom again.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.520
Everyone, please return to the conference hall.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.120
The evaluation results are in.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.990
Let's go.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.840
They're here! They're back!

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.350
How was it?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.790
This time,

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.310
the schedule...

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.050
was a bit tight.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.030
Revenge is a dish

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.240
best served cold.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.290
There will definitely be other projects
in the future.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.400
What?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.530
Why are you smiling?

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.230
Did we win?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.920
Ms. Zhou.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.110
I was just saying...

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.030
Hu Xiu, you guys are so bad at acting!

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.960
I couldn't help it!

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.440
Can't you hold it in a little longer?

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:36.720
I...

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.110
One vote! We beat Zhuling by one vote!

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:41.310
I knew it!

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.310
You didn't reply to my messages! I was worried sick!

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.640
I just wanted to give everyone a surprise.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.750
Everyone's been too tense lately.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.750
-Seriously!
-Just kidding. Relax.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.790
You need to improve your acting skills.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.960
I don't need much acting skill.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.000
As long as I can fool Commander Qin
in the game,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.860
that's enough.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.920
Is the design competition over yet?

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.040
Without the star there,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.970
poor Mr. Gong is having a hard time.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:15.650
Everyone has worked hard.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.450
Today, go home and get some rest.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.030
Later we'll have a celebration banquet.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:19.830
It'll be on Mr. Xiao.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.640
How's that?

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.920
Feel free to suggest any food you want.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:43.880
Honey!

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.680
Why are you waiting outside?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.410
Are you cold?

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.640
Look who's talking.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.840
You're late for your own class reunion.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.940
I stopped by our company after work.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.270
There were no parking spaces when I came here,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.670
so I had to park next door.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.640
You should just

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.750
quit that job soon.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.310
I will.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.270
Let's wait until the company
is more stable.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:04.870
Over here.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.330
Come on, everyone.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.680
I'd like to make a toast.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.310
This glass,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.200
we have to finish it all.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.550
We're all in Shanghai,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.830
yet we haven't seen each other in so long.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.630
Is that right?

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.790
There, there.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.480
Cheers!

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.270
Cheers!

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.830
All gone.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.830
Guangming,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.350
I have to say, you're still

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.310
the most thoughtful.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.160
No wonder you were the campus heartthrob back then.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.220
Oh, give me a break.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.110
Back in the day,

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.480
when we were in school,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.960
there were so many girls liked Guangming.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.750
Too bad

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.200
you married young.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.820
You broke so many women's hearts.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.730
My fault.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920
Alright, guy.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.070
We just sat down for a moment.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.200
Please, give me a break.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.240
Stop teasing me.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.680
Speaking of which,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.270
I just remembered something.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:56.880
Earlier,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.240
when we went to that conference,

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.440
I ran into Chi Xin.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.720
Chi Xin?

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.830
Do you remember her?

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.960
That junior sister?

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.000
I remember back then

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.400
we once worked on a project as a team.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.440
She came to us on her own,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.770
asking to join our team.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:08.880
She's

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.400
at Zhitung Tech now, I think.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.530
Pretty impressive.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.660
You're well informed.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.790
But you know what?
That day at the conference,

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.550
Chi Xin specifically came over

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.560
to add Guangming on WeChat.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.680
But,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.790
Guangming refused her immediately.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:24.400
Right.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.830
Later she came to me

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.110
and asked me to give her his WeChat.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.750
And then?

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.430
The man himself immediately refused.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.200
That's why Guangming

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.720
is a model husband.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.030
How does that saying go?

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.640
"Out of all the waters,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.930
I only take one scoop."

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.710
"Passing through a thousand flowers..."

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.680
"Not a petal touches me."

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.010
How come I didn't know about this?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.050
No need to report such a trivial matter.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:48.770
Come on.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.000
Let me make another toast.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.160
A toast to our former campus heartthrob.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.680
Come on!

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.240
Everyone!

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.830
Come on.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.640
And to our youth we can't go back to!

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.110
And to this model couple.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.200
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:00.960
Cheers!

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:11.860
What's this?

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.590
What?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.820
When did you buy this?

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.700
I noticed you're not in high spirits tonight.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.940
Is everything okay at the company?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.920
Do you remember that project

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.400
I mentioned to you at home?

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.700
The client's funding has been cut off.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.480
The project might be canceled.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.510
That project—

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.960
didn't they just transfer
the first payment

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.160
to your company?

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.510
If it stops now,

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.290
won't all the work you did before be in vain?

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.640
So that's why you came back from Jinshan

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.900
last time?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.440
Xiaorou,

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.640
don't worry.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.180
I won't let this project fail.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.830
There's already a big company

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.790
that's interested.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.190
We're still discussing.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.590
I'll definitely secure the deal.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.200
The cab is here. It's cold outside.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.360
Go back now.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.240
Tell the designated driver

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.270
to drive slowly.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.170
Let me know when you get to the company.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:30.650
Okay.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.820
I'm leaving.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.990
Bye.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.290
This way, Mr. Xiao.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.480
You're in good spirits, Mr. Xiao.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.920
Winning the competition

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.190
definitely calls for a drink

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.110
in a nice place.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.230
Yeah.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.440
The drinks here are good.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.080
Perfect for drowning one's sorrows.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.860
You know,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.000
these years since you came back to China,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.130
you're really different from before.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.909
You're more and more like a true elite.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.850
Remember to keep your tail hidden.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.030
Don't let it show.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.760
This game

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.360
is just getting started.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.960
You'll have to play along
with me until the end.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.560
A game that makes you go to such lengths—

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.760
I'll certainly play along until the end.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.000
After all,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.760
seeing you so on edge

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.340
is way more entertaining than drinking.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.710
Mr. Pei,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.210
let me take you to the VIP room

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.670
to complete your membership registration.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.710
Forget it.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.420
You let just anyone in here, don't you?

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.160
I heard about the competition.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.680
Congratulations.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.640
Thank you.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:56.780
Here.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.150
These are the personnel files from the steel factory back then.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.400
The director's secretary,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.070
finance staff,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.130
project managers—

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.630
anyone with a name

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.630
whose information could be found

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.360
is here.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.840
Well?

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.330
Is the one you're looking for among them?

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.590
Besides these,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.080
have you found anyone

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.040
who was closer to him?

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.480
Now that you mention it,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.530
there actually is someone.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.630
This person is quite interesting.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.230
He was the director's personal driver
back then.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.710
It's said that after the director died,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.670
he managed to climb the social ladder,

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.030
became a building materials supplier,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.560
and is now doing quite well.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800
His driver?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.840
Yes.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.560
[Supply Records]

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.000
He was such a nobody that it was hard

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.370
to even find his name.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.870
But the connection he made back then

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.790
is one you're familiar with.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.070
It's Zhuling Group.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:41.980
Dad,

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.840
you're back.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.800
Why didn't you tell me?

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.110
I could have come to pick you up.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.850
Don't you have anything
you want to tell me?

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.890
How's your health recently?

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.320
That determines

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.030
how I should talk to you

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.170
and how much I should tell you.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.000
You lost the competition,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.260
and you still dare to have this attitude?

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.190
Look at Xiao Zhiyu.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.570
In just a few years,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.250
he's already climbed to a position

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.330
the entire industry can't ignore.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.190
Dad,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.550
only those on the ground

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.050
need to climb up.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.990
People like me

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.960
just need to sit here

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.220
and give them the motivation to climb.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.710
With you like this,

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.590
how can I entrust Zhuling to you?

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.200
Think about it carefully.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.180
There's another thing

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.280
I need you to run an errand for me.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.840
Auntie Yue.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.840
Zhen.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.830
Take this soup

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.950
and try it.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.800
Is this for my dad?

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.800
I made a pot of this soup.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.040
There's more upstairs.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.100
I'll go get another bowl for your dad.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.880
Thank you.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.150
Mr. Pei,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.110
your coffee is ready.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.440
There are some new desserts we developed.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.370
Please try them.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:16.880
Thanks.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.430
And?

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.110
Okay.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.280
Qin Xiaoyi?
