[See you]

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.200
Take care.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.350
Bye-bye.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.880
Bye-bye.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.480
Bye-bye.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.950
He's here again?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.130
Seems like he's got other things in mind.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.829
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.310
Five iced Americanos,
three specialty drinks.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.240
Trying to make me even busier, huh?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.280
It's the weekend. Why did you come here

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.810
instead of resting at home?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.800
Because I have an uncanny knack
for foresight.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.040
I knew it would be busy

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.020
in the café this evening.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.520
I've noticed you're pretty well informed

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.280
about Qin Xiaoyi from Group A these days.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.740
He comes back
and you show up here right away.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.750
What,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080
your boss isn't hounding you
to draw plans on weekends anymore?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.150
My project is finished,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.280
so I deserve a break.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.320
Besides, he's doing a side job himself.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.240
That intense?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.890
Even the boss has to take on
a side hustle?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.710
He really should learn a thing or two
from Mr. Pei.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.470
Pei Zhen?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.750
Didn't the Qian Jinxin matter
wrap up already?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.520
What's up with him now?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.710
He went to play over across the street.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.520
Where?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.110
At the murder mystery game place
across the street.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.200
When?

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.760
About 10 minutes ago.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.310
You and that Mr. Pei, you two...

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.490
Where are you going?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.950
I'll talk to you later.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.829
Always so jumpy.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.150
No need to run.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.630
Their session has already started.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.280
Qin Xiaoyi is in Group A for this session,
right?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.840
Yes.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.120
He was on leave before.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.630
Today is his first day back performing.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.760
Well, it hasn't been going on for long.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.750
Could you get me a ticket?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.840
Please.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.560
You've played so many times,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.680
so you should know the rules.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.480
We don't admit latecomers here.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.280
I'm practically a regular player now.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.470
Can't you make an exception?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.730
I'll take any role,
as long as I can get in.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.630
There's really nothing I can do.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.360
This session's already full.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.800
Besides, it's against our rules.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.150
Thanks.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.900
Where does this corridor lead?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.290
To the lobby.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.290
It's one of the fire exits.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.970
Hello,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
this is ME Murder Mystery Game Club.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.310
Is the signal bad?

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.390
Hello,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.630
may I ask

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.430
if you know the way to the casino?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.270
I think it's up ahead.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.800
Yes, right up ahead.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.730
That way, right?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.720
Yes.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.950
Just go straight and turn right.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.870
That's right.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.910
Thank you.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.700
I didn't know I had to make money here.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.490
You want to make money, right?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.430
Go find that guy—

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.920
that guy

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.950
in a suit.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.870
He can help you.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.270
He's the son of a gambling tycoon.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.190
At the casino,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.190
he never loses.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.420
You can ask him for help.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.040
Are you a staff member

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.570
or playing some character?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.950
I'm a...

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.159
Time traveler.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.159
A-A hidden character.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.920
I know there's a map in your bag.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.320
It's something he needs.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.510
Make sure to ask him to help you.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.200
There really is.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.730
Thank you, time traveler.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.360
Sir!

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.490
Excuse me, sir!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.240
I heard you're the son of
a gambling tycoon,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.720
who makes a lot of money at the casino.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.800
You must've got the wrong person.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.240
Please take me along to make money.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.870
No, no.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.390
I... I...

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.070
I have to go. I've got things to do
over there.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.360
Please. Let's go.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.750
Don't drag me.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.040
Take me along to make money.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.600
Let's go.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.720
Excuse me,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.850
do you have a ticket?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.220
I-I'm here to find someone.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.220
I'll be going then.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.870
Hold on!

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.070
Control center,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.560
someone without a ticket
has entered the game.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.480
Do you copy, control center?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.940
Someone without a ticket
has entered the game!

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.950
[CCTV Room]

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.560
Fei.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.360
Pull up the CCTV footage for me.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.190
Let's see who's snuck in without a ticket.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.000
How brazen.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.750
Got it, Boss.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080
Boss, she's here.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.240
Zoom in. Zoom in.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.720
It's her.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.630
Boss,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.190
I remember she's a regular player.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.190
What is she doing?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.360
Looks like he's searching for Qin Xiaoyi.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.920
Boss.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.100
She didn't change into costume.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.430
It won't be good
if other players see her like this.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.040
Zheng Qi. Zheng Qi.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.640
Do you copy? Please respond.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.390
Yes, you've reached Freckled Li.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.830
There's a female player
who didn't change into costume

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.680
heading your way.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.190
Stop her and bring her out.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.360
Copy that.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.680
I think it should be here.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.600
Excuse me,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.680
you have to leave now.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.510
Freckled Li,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.310
give me some time.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.000
I'll leave as soon as I see Qin Xiaoyi.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.870
No can do.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.560
Boss said

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.360
you have to leave now.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360
What you're doing is
against the rules, you know?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.270
As soon as I see Qin Xiaoyi,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.070
I'll say just one thing

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.180
and leave right away.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.310
How about this? You can follow me.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.840
I promise I won't cause any trouble, okay?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.640
No.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.750
You're already causing trouble
just by being here.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.750
Leave. Leave now.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.210
Come here, guys!

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.390
Freckled Li is handing out a new mission!

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.390
H-He's handing out a new mission!

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.159
You've got a new mission?

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.510
Right, talk to him.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.570
What mission is it?

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.840
There's no mission.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.159
I've got no clues here.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:58.040
No clues at all.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.850
I've finally found you.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.690
Why are you here?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.540
Commander Qin.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.950
I've got important matters
to discuss with you.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.150
Come with me for a bit.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.410
Excuse me.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.950
So you're here, my contact up the chain,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.370
Qin Xiaoyi.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.640
Why did you barge in here?

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.630
I'm sorry.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.150
May I ask

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.030
when Qin Xiaoyi will come out?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.150
Mr. Pei.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.960
A murder mystery game here

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.220
lasts at least 4 hours,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.970
and Qin Xiaoyi is the one
with the highest win rate.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.780
I don't think you're so idle

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.070
as to wait until this game's over, right?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.630
Ms. Hu, you know this place so well.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.430
Sounds like you come here often.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.030
Since Zhuling lost the Design Competition,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.910
I've indeed got plenty of time to spare.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.970
I can afford to wait

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.680
this little bit of time.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.810
Alright, let's do that.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.390
Why did you come out here as well?

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.720
The game isn't over yet.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.390
I lost.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840
So fast?

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.080
You didn't deliberately lose

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.360
to get out early, did you?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.290
My professional integrity
wouldn't allow me to do that.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.650
S-So you...

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.750
I got distracted.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.630
You, oh you.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.180
Just put your mind at ease.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.710
What could I possibly do to Hu Xiu?

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.240
I wasn't talking about you.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.050
What business do you have with Qin Xiaoyi?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.750
I...

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.740
You'd better be honest.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.200
I saw everything just now.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.440
This is my fault.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.480
I think it was probably because of me

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.170
that Ms. Hu barged in here.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.080
Because of you?

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.300
Was it because of you or Qin Xiaoyi?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.150
Ms. Hu

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.550
probably didn't want me to recognize

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.790
this NPC here.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.590
I also just found out myself

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.830
that he works here.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.750
Let me introduce.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.920
Qin Xiaoyi here...

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.060
He's my younger brother.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
Younger brother?

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.990
Ms. Hu, are you waiting for me?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.510
Why did you suddenly come to
this murder mystery game place?

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.060
Zhiyu didn't tell us

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.430
that he works here.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.230
I only found out by chance.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.630
I was curious, so I wanted

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.290
to come and confirm it myself.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.960
Don't worry,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.200
I won't make things difficult
for my own brother.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.910
Mr. Pei, when you deliberately
leaked news

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.550
of Zhuling's cooperation with Yueheng

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.750
on the lane hotel project ahead of time,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.850
you didn't care that Mr. Xiao
was your brother, did you?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.520
So this is what you've been upset about
all along.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.920
There are so many lanes
in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area—

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.180
it's nothing unusual.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.450
If the ideas happened to overlap,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.240
we can only say it was a coincidence.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.870
Besides,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.480
it was business competition to begin with—

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.010
it's every man for himself.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.080
Do you understand?

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.270
A coincidence?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.150
Fine, if you say it was a coincidence,
let's say it was.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.790
He won anyway.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.670
So in your opinion, Ms. Hu,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.740
I acted improperly

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.250
and lacked ability,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.960
so I deserved to lose?

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.440
But do you really know Xiao Zhiyu well?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.640
Is he really so upright
and proper himself?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.590
He's just a thief

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.270
who, at the age of 12,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.260
dared to sneak into my father's study

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.450
and try cracking the safe's code.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.820
A thief?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.510
What did he steal?

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.380
What do you think was in the safe?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.660
How would I know what he wanted to steal?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.570
As a child, he dared to steal
from our home;

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.080
and ever since he grew up,
he's been doing everything possible

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.610
to humiliate the Pei family

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.790
and Zhuling.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.480
Between him and me,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.870
it's never been
as simple as business competition.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.210
But what disappoints me most

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.670
is that such a smart person

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.620
as you, Ms. Hu,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.750
actually chose him.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.080
Let's go.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.330
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.020
To celebrate you
securing Lyman's new project.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.570
You know perfectly well

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.750
whose idea it was.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.840
I was helping

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.790
at Regard

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.870
when I accidentally found out

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.400
that Pei Zhen joined
the murder mystery game.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.890
I remember you said

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.060
that only in murder mystery games

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.990
could you not have to be Xiao Zhiyu.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.120
Although I don't know

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.080
why you don't want to be Xiao Zhiyu,

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.510
I'll make sure to preserve

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.870
this sanctuary for you.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.550
It's just I didn't expect

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.520
that he would still find out.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.870
Is he really your elder brother?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.510
No.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.870
Not by blood.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.510
I figured.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.110
You have different surnames

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.010
and don't look alike at all.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.200
A blended family?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.600
It was a long time ago.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.930
I'm here to collect coffee.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.370
No need to check.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.900
I placed all these orders.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.240
I had no idea that you, Mr. Gong,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.120
loves

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.650
Regard's coffee this much.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.050
I'm just getting it
for a young guy who works at our club.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.560
I only drink whiskey.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.000
Is that Pei Zhen

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.660
really Xiao Zhiyu's brother?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.960
If it weren't for what happened yesterday,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.910
who would have known

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.790
that his stepfather is

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.400
such a renowned figure
in the construction industry?

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.260
So why is he still working so hard?

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.510
Haven't you known Mr. Xiao
for a long time?

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.030
I have,

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.790
but you know his temperament.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:07.599
It's not like
he reports everything to me, right?

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.790
The two of us met

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.750
when we were in college in America.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.069
In the college, apart from

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.680
second-generation immigrants
and rich kids,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.069
there were only struggling students
supported by their entire families.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.000
Since he didn't bring up

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.680
his family affairs himself,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.000
I wasn't in the right place to pry.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.589
So,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.160
what was he like back in America?

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.680
Well, he...

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.950
He was indeed quite unusual.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.880
His family

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.810
never came to visit him in college,

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.830
and he didn't socialize with
any of us classmates, either.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.400
Besides attending classes,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.750
he just worked part-time outside.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.810
He lived completely in his own world.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.350
We only met his mother

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.000
on graduation day.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.350
But their relationship

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.550
seemed...

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.590
How did it seem?

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.640
Well...

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.070
They seemed

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.640
very distant

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.610
and awkward.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.110
Mom.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.240
Zhiyu, you're here.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.540
Come on, have a seat.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.590
Zhiyu.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.550
It's been ages. Why do I feel like

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.030
you've lost even more weight?

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.160
Come on, have a seat.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.920
You're here, Zhiyu.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.350
No drinks for me.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.240
Alright, sir.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.310
Zhiyu.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.310
Good boy.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.830
It's only been a few years,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.510
and you've turned an unknown small studio

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.960
into what it is today.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.170
Your prospects are limitless.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.960
Zhiyu.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.110
Uncle Pei is complimenting you.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.200
You're too kind.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.940
You must all be hungry.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.720
Let's eat.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.880
Yeah.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.440
It's rare for our whole family
to be together.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.570
Let's start eating.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.350
Wanyue.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.060
I've ordered

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.860
all your favorite dishes.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.550
Zhiyu.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.120
I specially ordered this fish for you.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.950
I forgot to ask them
to remove the green onions.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.000
Let me remove them for you.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.640
Mom,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.030
I can

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.640
eat green onions now.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.280
But when you were little...

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.930
That was all in the past.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.050
Mom.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.640
I remember you used to

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.050
really love these
sweet and sour lotus root slices.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.050
Please have more.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.920
Mrs. Xiao,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.070
your blood sugar has been high
these past few years.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.790
I specifically ordered
many vegetarian dishes for you.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.790
Please eat more of those.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.520
Zhen, you still remember that?

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.400
Zhiyu.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.780
I packed some food for you.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.040
You didn't eat anything just now.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.370
Work is important, but you need to
take care of yourself too.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.440
This is the restaurant's signature snack,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.510
called...

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.780
Crab shell pastry.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.260
Right, crab shell pastry.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.790
You've been in Shanghai for years.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.790
You must've tried it before, right?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.720
Mom.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.340
I didn't know your blood sugar
had been high these years.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.410
It's nothing. Just a minor issue.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:40.970
I'm leaving.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.270
I've grown up.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.590
I make my own choice.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.410
As for the money,

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.070
I'll figure something out myself.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.480
This isn't about money.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.110
Why do you have to study architecture?

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.200
And you had to choose a college

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.270
so far away from me.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.270
What are you standing there for?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.110
Come and help.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.110
Come on.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.520
Here comes help.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.830
Thank you.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.550
You pull that way, I'll pull this way.

some sweet soup

I'll bring it over for you in a bit.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.790
Thank you then.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.920
No need to bring it upstairs.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.320

Crab shell pastry?

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.200
You bought this?

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.080
Someone gave it to me.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.710
That's a lot.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:15.760
Here.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.250
This is to warm your hands.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.000
It's okay.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.060
I'll just apply some hand cream on it.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.480
What are you doing with this?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.960
Here.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.540
Put your hand in it.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.550
If you want to protect your hands,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.280
this method is very effective.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.480
Mr. Xiao, I didn't know
you had this kind of knowledge.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.550
Back when I worked part-time abroad,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.880
washing dishes in the cold

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.010
would make sores break out on my hands.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.450
Later, a coworker taught me this trick.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.640
You...

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.480
What?

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.720
I just never expected

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.980
that someone like you,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.830
a golden boy,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.790
would do such hard labor.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.750
I'm no golden boy.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.310
He's just a thief,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.000
who, at the age of 12,

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.890
dared to sneak into my father's study

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.090
and try cracking the safe's code.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.240
How did it seem?

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.000
They seemed

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.480
very distant

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.340
and awkward.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.440
How come?

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.310
I only happened to hear about it later

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.960
that

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.200
his biological father passed away early,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.750
and his mother remarried soon after.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.510
He

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.180
didn't want to spend
his stepfather's money,

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.270
so he became independent at an early age

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.330
and left that home.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.400
Did you

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.350
have a really hard life back then?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.130
I'm going upstairs.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.890
Remember to apply it yourself, too.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.030
Wang also wanted to come,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.000
but he really couldn't make it.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.170
Guangming really pushes himself.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.130
There's no other choice.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.830
He's running back and forth
between two sides right now,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.230
and the pressure's huge.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.350
Yeah.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.440
If you need any help,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.510
just let me know.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.440
What's on your mind?

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.960
So,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.000
that Qin Xiaoyi from Group A

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.110
is your boss?

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.030
And that fengshui master

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.350
is Gong Huaicong?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.000
I didn't say anything at first

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.600
because I was worried
my boss would silence me.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.550
Because in their club,

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.440
except for Mr. Gong,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.640
no one knows about his second identity.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.680
What about later?

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.070
Later, it was out of
my own selfish motive.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.920
Well,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.110
I just think

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.910
he really enjoys
playing the murder mystery game.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.000
You didn't want anyone to spoil his fun.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.310
That's why you rushed over
to stop Mr. Pei that day, right?

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.240
Xiu.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960
I think

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.420
you've got other feelings

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.720
for Xiao Zhiyu.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.030
Look,

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.000
if you only saw him as your boss,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.070
you'd only care about

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.480
the rent bills

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.550
and the results of the games,
things like that.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.590
But now, you care about his feelings

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.120
and you want him to be happy.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.310
I...

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.660
Also,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.160
I think his feelings for you

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.560
aren't so simple either.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.110
He's living at your place,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.710
supposedly for the project.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.030
But the fact that
he agreed to be your roommate—

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.430
roommates of all things—

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.580
that's a bit hard to make sense of.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.080
A man and a woman living together,
you know?

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:46.200
Xiu.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.880
I think your spring is
just around the corner.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.070
Let's move to another place.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.440
Waiter, check please.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920
I'll pay.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.560
-I know you spoil me the most, Xiu.
-This is the receipt.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.890
It's 380 yuan in total.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.350
We're celebrating our restaurant's
second anniversary lately.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.210
Here's a customized gift for you.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.160
Thank you.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.440
Today, we received

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.640
Lyman's authorization letter
for the design intent.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.350
This project

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.480
is finally secured.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.070
There have been
quite a few issues recently.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.790
This result is thanks to
everyone's hard work.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.320
You'll definitely get
your project bonuses.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.390
Excellent!

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.030
Today,

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.640
Mr. Wu from Huasheng Materials
is also here with us.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640
Thank you, Mr. Wu,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.910
for taking time to attend
our celebration banquet.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:53.940
We also hope

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.640
you'll continue to support us, Mr. Wu.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.350
Don't mention it.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.000
It's our honor

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.660
to collaborate with D Studio.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.480
Come on,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.310
let's all raise a toast to Mr. Wu.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.590
Come on.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.550
Alright, to Mr. Wu!

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.070
Here's to the smooth progress
of our project.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.510
Cheers.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:06.710
Don't drink too much.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.030
Just a little bit.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.530
Don't be like last time.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.370
Cheers. To you, Mr. Wu.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.590
Hu Xiu,

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.700
congratulations on passing probation.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.830
Passing probation?

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.410
Aren't there still 2 months left?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.880
It's been moved up.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.540
Mr. Xiao already informed me.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.160
As expected from someone
I spotted from the beginning.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.720
Dong Qi.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.700
Weren't you looking for the restroom?

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.500
I found it.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.140
Come on, I'll show you the way.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.270
Let's go.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.040
-Mr. Wu.
-Ms. Hu.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.500
No more drinks.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.670
Mr. Xiao said

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.450
you couldn't

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.680
hold your liquor, Ms. Hu.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.540
Better listen to Mr. Xiao, right?

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.480
Ms. Hu.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.070
I heard from your colleagues

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.210
that you used to work
at a real estate company.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.240
Yes.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.270
From real estate

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.510
to architectural design—

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.830
it must've been hard for you, Ms. Hu.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.350
This industry is quite demanding.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.130
If you want to achieve something,

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.660
you have to sacrifice a lot.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.550
Compared to rough guys like us,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.550
it's even harder for you young ladies.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.750
However,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.320
with Mr. Xiao's support,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.440
Ms. Hu,

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.690
you're much luckier than most people.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.160
Especially the fact that Mr. Xiao

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.760
is such a talented young man.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.110
A man with such potential

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.550
is rare to come by.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.170
This mushroom

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.400
tastes a bit strange.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.510
Just like I find

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.570
what you just said quite strange too.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.240
You misunderstood.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.410
I didn't mean anything negative about you.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.440
I just thought

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.030
if there are suitable projects
in the future,

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.560
we could collaborate more.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.630
Mr. Wu,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.650
I'm not the one
who can decide on collaborations.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.980
I understand.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.170
I spoke out of turn.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.680
Mr. Xiao, you've finished your business?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.350
Ms. Hu and I were having a nice chat.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.510
Hu Xiu.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.550
There's a conference call in 5 minutes.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.400
Come with me.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.480
Mr. Xiao.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.940
What conference call?

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.740
What did Mr. Wu say to you just now?

00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.680
Nothing.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.520
Then why are you upset?

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.830
I'm not.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.960
You weren't even there just now.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.560
How could you know I'm upset?

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.290
Actions speak louder than words.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.880
Do you know

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.210
that you've always had a habit?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.400
Whenever you're upset,

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.410
you fidget with your fingers.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.640
I'm okay.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.930
I just tripped accidentally.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.340
Mr. Xiao, you seem to enjoy
observing your subordinates a lot.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.750
Can you tell me now?

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.880
What happened just now?

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.000
He underestimated me.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.160
But it doesn't matter
what he thinks of me.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.830
As long as his
3D spatial construction technology

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.360
can help our studio,
that's all that matters.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:16.320
Stop.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.120
Mr. Xiao,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.690
please stop observing me.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.070
I couldn't care less about you.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.880
Mr. Xiao.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.230
Why didn't you wake me up

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.920
when we arrived?

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.670
I've got nothing urgent to do.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.320
Get off.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.320
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.920
Mr. Xiao.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.960
I couldn't get any strength.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.400
I just

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.270
couldn't open this.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.320
Cut it out.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.920
I've used this trick before.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.510
Get off.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:06.880
I'm okay.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.980
Well then.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.000
Snow?

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.850
It's snowing.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.150
Mr. Xiao,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.630
it's really snowing.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.320
Look.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.880
Hu Xiu,

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.990
are you hallucinating?

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.960
I

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.320
think

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.940
