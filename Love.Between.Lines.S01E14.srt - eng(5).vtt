00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.030
I got drunk and blacked out?

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.310
I ate poisonous mushrooms

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.750
and got mildly poisoned?

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.840
Mr. Xiao,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.470
s-sorry for the trouble last night.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.200
Are the other colleagues okay?

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.150
They're fine.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.670
Well...

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.550
I didn't do anything inappropriate
last night, did I?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.360
In such a hurry
to clear yourself of it, huh?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.420
It's not like that.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.320
I just completely blacked out.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.860
Did I curse at you?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.750
No.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.450
I hit you?

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.960
I'm sorry, Mr. Xiao.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.710
I really can't recall anything.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.190
If you're upset about it,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.850
you can hit me back if you want.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.570
Are you sure?

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:38.870
Dream on.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.190
I'm going out for a while.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.590
Remember to eat it later.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.960
He could at least eat before leaving.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.970
What delicious food did he make?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.990
You're awake?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.710
Go get some more sleep.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.710
It's still early.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.120
No way.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.310
I thought of some desserts last night.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.570
I need to give them a try
at the shop today.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.950
Why am I feeling so drowsy?

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.800
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.130
I'm helping you wake up.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.650
Here it comes.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.159
Boss.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.830
My mom sent you
these eight-treasure pastries.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.230
Did your mom visit your place?

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.630
No, she had them delivered to me
by FlashEx.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.800
I see.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.970
After all, you have someone
living at your place now.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.680
That's just my regular roommate.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.040
I never said otherwise.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.550
I'll text your mom on WeChat.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.190
Mrs. Bai, I received the pastries.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.190
Thank you so much.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.970
I haven't even tried them yet.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.360
Now that the Design Competition is over,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.270
I feel so empty inside.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.310
I can tell.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.070
You're showing up here from time to time.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.390
I can't keep you company tonight.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.870
Wang is clocking out early today.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.600
We're having dinner together.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.130
The two of us haven't
had a proper meal together in ages.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.120
I understand.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.750
First come, first served.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.270
I fully understand.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.950
How about this?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.800
In order to make it up to you,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.750
I'll treat you to a murder mystery game.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.410
No, thanks.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.310
You can go play with Li Yue.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.800
I heard they're
having special events these days.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.720
I'm wondering where they get
all these creative ideas from.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.380
No worries,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.390
I have coupons.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.680
Three.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.270
Two.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.159
One.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.020
He comes to buy coffee
at this time every day now.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.680
Oh, you're here, too!

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.240
The usual?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.510
The usual.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.120
Okay.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.960
Alright.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.040
The promotional leaflets
have all been handed out.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.510
Remember to give me the coupons later.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.190
No problem.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.400
When did you two
form this strategic partnership?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.600
It's nothing like that.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.390
I'm simply

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.390
helping Li Yue meet

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.050
his promotional KPI targets.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.390
Your next round is about to kick off.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.390
You should go now.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.070
See you.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.760
Bye-bye.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.430
Song Lina,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.000
a spy funded by a mysterious person.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.070
Your first mission is

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.920
to stop the new Commander
from entering the city.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.430
Look!

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.560
It's actually Qin Xiaoyi from Group A!

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.260
Group A?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.000
So he ended up here?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.210
It's actually Qin Xiaoyi!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.870
This look is

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.650
quite dope.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.390
Hold on.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.120
I remember I have a mission.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.830
Commander Qin!

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.270
Please wait a moment!

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.720
My dad...

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240
My father was wrongfully imprisoned.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.120
He's suffering greatly from illness now.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.630
Commander, please help me

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.290
deliver this medicine to him.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.240
I

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.070
cannot do you this favor.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.360
What kind of attitude was that?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.840
Is it because of what happened last night?

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.920
What on earth happened last night?

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.830
Miss Song,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.110
I have something for you.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:51.920
Here you are.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.340
How did I not notice before

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.070
that there was sponsorship here?

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.380
Even when drinking water,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.180
you should also stay observant.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.430
Miss Song,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.390
see you at the ballroom at 9 tonight.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.400
Your ex-lover will invite you to dance.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.950
Please help him win the position of mayor.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.380
Ex-lover?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.100
How melodramatic.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.510
Is he

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.580
my ex-lover?

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.070
No way...

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.670
Miss Song,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.320
shall we dance?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.000
You're such a master
of switching moods, Commander.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.550
You were so aloof to me
on the street earlier.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.720
And now you've invited me to dance.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.150
You're way better

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.770
than me at switching moods.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.200
Nonsense.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.790
I'm always steadfast in principles

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.060
and consistent in ideas and actions.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.190
Consistent in ideas and actions?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.350
Does that mean

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.630
you do everything following your heart?

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.080
Yes.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.320
By the way,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.370
give me that medicine bottle.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.670
You just rejected me on the street.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.380
There were too many people watching.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.840
I couldn't tell if they were good or evil.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.350
Give me the medicine bottle.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.610
I will find a way
to send it to your father.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.960
I'm not

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.820
like some irresponsible people.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.000
Qin Xiaoyi.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.130
Oh, no, it's a dead end.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.930
Find that person at all costs!

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.820
Hurry and hide!

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.330
Get in here.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.870
Go check inside!

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.670
Let's go

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.800
check over there.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.270
Is he gone?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.000
Well, then,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.400
can you make some space now?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.910
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.040
I'm not taking advantage of you, okay?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.000
It wouldn't be the first time anyway.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.720
Watch your language. When did I ever...

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.320
Watch out.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.860
Actually, there's something

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.490
I've always wanted to say.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.860
You have

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.470
♪ Close your eyes for me ♪

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.110
a really good-looking face.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.020
Wait.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.730
Don't get me wrong.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.600
That night, I was hallucinating

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.910
due to those mushrooms.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.480
I was

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.080
not sober and made a mistake.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.520
Anyway, don't take anything I did

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.010
seriously.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.760
Of course not.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.370
If I had taken it seriously.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.570
I wouldn't be standing here right now.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.500
So... Let's move on from this.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:02.970
Where

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.210
are you going next?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.810
To find Feng Youjin.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.360
Here's all the intelligence
Feng Youjin needs.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.320
If you want to seek cooperation with him,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.650
it should come in handy.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.400
I'm leaving.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.380
What on earth did I do?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.240
Honey.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.510
My husband is home so early today.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.200
Zhan Jie is taking my shift tonight.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.990
I came home in a hurry to get some rest.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.790
He'll probably stay up all night.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.440
It's going to be exhausting.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.550
Let me order some food for him.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.480
No need. I've ordered some for him.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.550
Tired?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.200
Let me show you
the account I've been working on.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.130
It's gained quite a few followers.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.070
101 followers?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.880
Yep.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.390
So what?

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.790
With 7 more, they could play
the 108 heroes in "Water Margin."

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.750
Fine.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.990
I'll ask some colleagues of mine tomorrow

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.650
to fulfill your heroic dream.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.990
Is this it?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.200
This, too?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.730
Last night, I tried to contact Zhan Jie

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.440
to help me fix a bug,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.320
but I couldn't get through to him.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.660
This wasn't the first time recently.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.600
Aren't you two good friends?

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.450
What's wrong with him?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.080
I really don't know.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.480
But

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.300
if there's any bug you want to fix,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.720
you can ask me to do it as well.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.240
Yes.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.160
You were the first one
who popped into my mind.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.270
However,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.120
someone told me

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.390
that you've been
working extra hours outside a lot lately.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.520
So you might not have time to come over.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.030
Guangming,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.590
you've been working for me,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.300
and I've treated you well, right?

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.790
If you want to venture out on your own,

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.520
that's fine.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.030
We can have a proper farewell party.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.120
But you can't take outside jobs

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.080
while still getting paid by me.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.070
That's simply improper,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.370
right?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.160
You have indeed treated me well.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.150
The business trips were
always assigned to me.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.960
I needed to be gone
for at least 2 months every time.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.350
I assisted with every major project,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.720
but when it came to payment,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.600
suddenly I was counted
as "a friend helping out."

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.560
My phone must be on 24 hours a day,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.470
just waiting for your orders.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.270
Honestly, I really don't

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.620
want to live this kind of life anymore.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.590
What are you doing?

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.990
I'll make sure the handover goes smoothly.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.460
Honey, what brings you here?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.780
These are all your favorites, right?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.270
These shops are quite far from each other.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.720
Didn't you just get off work?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.260
How did you find time
to go to all these places?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.670
I was working outside the office today.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.130
A client came to Shanghai.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.660
I took him around the city.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.710
Don't you want to ask me

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120
about how everything's going

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.480
with our company?

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.930
Didn't you promise
you wouldn't let the project fail?

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.410
I believe you, of course.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.800
I was afraid that asking too much
would add to your stress.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.360
Don't just sit there.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360
Have some food, too.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.220
I'm not hungry.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.390
I need to go back to the office
to meet with Zhan Jie.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.360
You still have something to work on?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.390
It's almost done.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.800
Once we officially sign the contract

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.330
and hand over the project
to that big company,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.180
everything will be wrapped up.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.390
Okay.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.240
Soon.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.550
There you are.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.010
I just wandered around

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.280
and bought you a gift.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.550
I haven't

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.960
bought you anything in the past few years.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.420
I don't wear these things.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.770
Don't waste your money.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.480
It's just a small gift.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.170
Tomorrow morning,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.260
I'll go pick you up.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.099
I've got everything ready
for the grave visit.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.030
You don't need to worry about that.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.670
Is there a problem?

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.000
Zhiyu.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.480
I'm afraid

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.440
I couldn't make it.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.960
You couldn't make it when you were

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.820
abroad before.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.720
But now you're back.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.600
I'm not...

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.550
ready to visit your father's grave yet.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.310
You still resent him?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.400
He left without a word back then

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.910
and left everything to me.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.110
How could I not resent him?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.880
Kanghua?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.920
Almost done.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.360
I'm with Zhiyu right now.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.030
Don't worry about me.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.200
Wait for me tonight.
Let's go back together...

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.880
I have something to handle.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.940
I'll take my leave.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.790
Hu!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.270
You bought so many things.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.530
They're all for my dad.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.030
Madam.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.520
Can you grab those cherries for me?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.400
There you go.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:15.880
Be careful.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.810
It is a bit heavy.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.880
Hu.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.070
Who won today?

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.060
We're drawing even.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.110
Mr. Xiao.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.470
You didn't go to the studio today.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.070
Did you go shopping instead?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.920
I accidentally

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.510
dropped this bag on the ground.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.440
Do you want to check if it's broken?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.070
It's fine.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.030
I don't need it anyway.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.690
If you like it, you can take it.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.240
I can take it?

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.880
What is it...

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.960
I've seen this before.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.400
It's said to support
a painless blood glucose monitor.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.130
The ads are really hyping it up.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.160
Try it out.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.000
Mr. Xiao,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.920
I must be honest with you.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.750
This watch

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.200
offers quite a lot of functions,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.350
but the watchband style is
way too old-fashioned,

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.480
like something my parents would like.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.790
Forget it if you don't like it.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.440
Give it back to me.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.750
I haven't finished testing yet.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.480
Give it back.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.030
I'll return it to you
when I'm done testing.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.720
Give it to me. Come on.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.050
I'll give it back when I'm done testing...

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.440
I think it's malfunctioning.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.170
Take it back.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.480
Dad.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.920
Xiu.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.770
Did you get everything?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.000
Don't worry.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.930
I bought everything you asked for.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.240
Get up early tomorrow.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.350
Don't delay anything.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.480
I won't delay. Just wait for me at home.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.160
Okay.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.160
There's nothing else. I'll hang up.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.520
Mr. Hu, Mrs. Bai.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.880
The car can't drive up here.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.720
Carrying so many things,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.790
you must be exhausted.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.400
Mr. Hu, would you like to take a break?

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.800
It's okay. I'm not tired.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.190
Han Xuan, you're back from school?

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.130
We're on vacation.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.300
I just got here yesterday.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.780
Come on.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.790
New Year's lucky money.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.960
Take it as an early gift from me.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.160
He's grown up now.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.480
There's no need to give him lucky money.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.640
But he's still a kid.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.550
College students need money to spend.
Take it.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.550
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.990
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.790
Let's go then.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.310
Okay.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.290
Xiu, let me carry that for you.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:31.820
Thanks.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.030
How's your new job?

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.270
Not bad.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.240
No matter how busy you are at work,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.750
remember not to miss your meals.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.410
Now you're giving Xiu advice.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.790
You've grown even taller.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.510
Han,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.880
we've come to visit you.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.430
[Here rests Han Chuan]

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.200
Mr. Hu,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.140
please take care of yourself.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.920
Mr. Hu,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.810
please don't mind me saying,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.790
but you should rest that leg more.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.270
Or it'll keep flaring up,

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.200
and your knee won't heal properly.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.240
Compared to Han,

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.560
my leg injury is nothing.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.710
Bro!

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.030
The location of the distribution box

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.400
and the wiring route have been set.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.400
You're so efficient with your work.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.150
Bro.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.600
Those dried fruits
you bought last time were so good.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.450
Where did you get them?

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.250
Tasty, right?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.190
I'll buy some more tomorrow.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.760
My wife, Renzi, is picky about food.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.290
She loved these fruits
when she was pregnant.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.750
Okay. Thanks, bro.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.720
Come on!

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.050
Why are you thanking me?

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.590
I should be the one saying thank you.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.030
Your wife is pregnant now.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.400
Right?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.310
And you still agreed to work with me.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.270
To be honest,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.360
I'd feel uneasy

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.520
if you weren't here.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.970
But who could have imagined

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.080
that the stadium would collapse?

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.540
The chief architect committed suicide

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.990
and left everything behind.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.750
Yet Han

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.490
didn't even get to see his child.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.780
Jerk!

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.620
Suicide was too easy for you!

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.810
Don't think suicide can exempt you
from responsibility!

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.090
My husband is only 40!

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.310
How are we, a widow and an orphan,
supposed to survive?

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.910
You owe me my husband's life!

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.440
[Qin Yuze's memorial service]

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.030
You murderer!

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.000
This isn't over just because he's dead!

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.730
You, the Qin family,
must give us an explanation!

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.780
Don't try to shirk the blame!

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.160
Right!

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.960
His family must atone for our losses!

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.360
Otherwise, who will take responsibility?

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.060
My dad asked me

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.160
to come on behalf of him and Mrs. Xiao

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160
to pay respects.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.130
You are just as stubborn
as when you were a child.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Unfortunately, there's something

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.590
you can't solve
by throwing a temper tantrum.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:36.960
Don't you agree,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.310
Qin Xiaoyi?

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.160
[Qin Yuze]

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.790
So you're Qin Xiaoyi?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.510
Your younger brother has changed his name.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.720
He took my surname.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.250
He's called Xiao Zhiyu.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.200
From now on,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.680
you'll be the one to protect your brother.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.470
Starting today,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.560
do not call him by his old name anymore

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.600
or tell anyone who his father is.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.570
Understand?

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.570
I'll keep that in mind.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.830
After all these years,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.280
you dare not use your real name.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.720
You've changed your name,
but you can't let go of the past.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.440
So you can only use
the name "Qin Xiaoyi" in the game

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.640
to comfort yourself.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.450
How pathetic.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.540
Be more careful in the future.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.280
The Pei family
has kept your secret for years.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.310
If your identity is exposed,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.250
and it gets Zhuling involved,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.170
I won't let you off the hook.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:18.560
By the way...

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.750
If some people find out

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.400
that you changed your name and identity

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.200
to cover up the stains on you,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.440
will they still see you
the way they do now?

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.960
With all that talk about justice,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.490
yet you,
the Peis, are the ones playing dirty.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.620
If there ever comes a day
when Zhuling falls,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.730
it should be the Pei family
bringing it upon themselves.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.130
What are you trying to say?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.350
Dad,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.840
I've sent the flowers

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.880
as you told me to.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.960
Good.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.310
However,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.820
he didn't seem to appreciate it.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.290
As long as the flowers were delivered,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.690
and Wanyue can be at ease,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:18.800
that's enough.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.280
How's your waist?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.030
Feeling better now?

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.830
Much better.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.350
Did you finish those treatments
at the Chinese medicine clinic?

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.310
Not yet.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.960
Renzi, please don't spend extra money
on me anymore.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.840
It's fine.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.530
How was your semester?

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.930
Just so-so, I think.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.640
Xuan,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.960
is something bothering you?

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.310
Xiu, I...

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.050
want to quit school.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.830
Why?

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.350
Look,

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.160
nowadays,

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.070
the job market is so competitive,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.030
and I'm just from a second-tier college.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.510
I don't think I'll have any advantage
after graduation.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.440
I just want to start working
to gain some experience.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:11.690
The point is

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.420
that my mom is getting older,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.350
and I can't bear to let her
continue working as a cleaner

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.680
to pay for my schooling.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.330
Xuan, you've grown up.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.440
Xiu, do you

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.830
support me?

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720
I understand you,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.670
but I don't support this.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.720
I still remember
how determined and exhilarated you were

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.510
when you chose your major.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.240
Yes, but...

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.570
I just think my mom is working too hard.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.960
I feel like she is stuck

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.880
in this kind of life because of me.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.040
So you think if you drop out now,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.160
your mom will be relaxed and free?

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:53.830
Isn't that the case?

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.330
If you really drop out of school,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.260
that's when she'll truly be stuck.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.270
Trust me.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.750
No parent in this world

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.960
would ever want their child
to give up their dreams

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.160
for their sake.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.050
If only...

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.480
If only that accident had never happened.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.200
That's all water under the bridge.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960
We need to move on.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.750
Look,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.790
I also used to regret
not being able to study abroad.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.510
But now,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.100
I'm back doing architectural design again.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.590
Xuan, don't give up so easily, okay?

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.720
If some people find out

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.240
that you changed your name and identity

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.070
to cover up the stains on you,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.270
will they still see you
the way they do now?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:33.530
Can't fall asleep?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.880
I had too much coffee.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.020
What about you?

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.830
I...

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.000
Same here.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.530
I can't fall asleep either.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.820
Check your phone.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.310
It's the song I listen to
when I need help sleeping.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.000
If you have trouble falling asleep,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.260
you could give it a try.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.510
Then why are you still up?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.200
I'm listening to it now.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.390
It just hasn't kicked in yet.

that your factory is doing well lately.

And you're even expanding.

Thanks to our partnership

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.150
with Zhuling in the past couple of years,

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.960
the factory is finally on the right track.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.670
Though our business
has been okay these years,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.630
I still have to go seek orders myself.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.840

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.920
that companies with 3D printing

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.440
and building material technology
in China are

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.370
all Zhuling's business partners.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.190
I'm just riding on your coattails,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.150
barely surviving.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.600
You're being too modest, Mr. Wu.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.550
I heard

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.370
that you're
taking on a big project recently.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.190
Mr. Pei,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.710
I've always valued our cooperation
with Zhuling.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.400
If there's anything you need,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.330
just let me know.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.720
Have some tea.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.600
It's my fault.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.000
I should have urged Lyman

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.100
to push the cooperation process forward
with Mr. Wu.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100
I never expected

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.190
that even after we reached an agreement,

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.650
they would still back out.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.070
They claimed to be unable
to meet the production demands.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:42.950
All excuses.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.070
I've contacted

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.400
all 3D ceramic technology companies

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.590
that I could find.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.230
But they all have deep cooperation

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.590
with one company.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.480
As soon as I mentioned our project,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.840
they all politely declined.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.040
Seems like they were warned in advance.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.750
Zhuling.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.160
I've also asked around.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.670
Years ago, Zhuling started

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.630
laying the groundwork
in the building materials sector,

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.960
which led to its monopoly position today.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.590
But we can't let supply channels

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.590
hold us back.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.320
Let's sort out a Plan B.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.460
For example,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.680
we could change the facade design plan.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.800
There is actually an alternative plan.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.590
-No.
-No way.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.800
The visual highlight of Lyman's projects

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.400
exactly lies
in the facade's layers and textures.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.190
The 3D printed ceramic bricks can balance

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.550
both the vintage vibe
and the modern deconstructivist design.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.550
Once we change the materials,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.280
all our efforts will be wasted.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.380
If we want to keep the design,

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.470
there's another option.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.400
That is to cooperate with Zhuling.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.420
Meeting adjourned.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.630
I'll think it over.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.480
Xiao Zhiyu can't find a supply channel.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.630
And when it comes to design,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.880
he's the kind of person
who never compromises.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.760
At this point,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.230
he must be caught
between a rock and a hard place.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.000
This move of yours

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.130
has really cut Xiao Zhiyu to the quick.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.840
I have no interest
in petty people gloating

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.500
over their success.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.500
This one actually went out of business?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.220
Mr. Xiao!

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:39.030
I-I'm sorry.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.560
I didn't know you were here.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.480
Why are you like a cat,

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.960
walking without making any sound?

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.160
The same goes for you.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.540
You jumped up pretty fast like a rabbit.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.810
Put some ice on it now.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.440
Does it hurt?

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.490
I bumped into you that hard?

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840
What do you think?

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.410
I-I'll do it myself.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.590
Mr. Xiao.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.290
I just

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.070
found a small company

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.920
that should be able to produce

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.050
the 3D printed ceramic bricks we need.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.150
His company

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.080
used to make 3D artistic ceramics.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.570
There's not much information available.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.960
All we know is that the owner
returned from Jingdezhen

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.630
and has just entered

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.840
the building materials field
in the past couple of years.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.990
This company may not be well-known,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.630
but its craftsmanship

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.430
might meet our standards.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.830
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.630
Is it

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.910
not suitable?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.870
Factories with a background in crafts
like this one are

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:30.080
generally small in scale

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.880
and focus on quality over speed.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.410
For projects as big as Lyman's,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.540
they might not be able to keep up
with the supply demands.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.290
Your head hurts from the bump?

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:43.480
I need to cool down.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.440
You're right.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.890
This production capacity issue is

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.440
indeed very important.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.520
It's already 10 PM.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.610
Time to go home.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.400
Let's go home.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.560
Turn off the lights.
