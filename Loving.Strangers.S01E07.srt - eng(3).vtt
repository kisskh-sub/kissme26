00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.580
Why should I?

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.490
He cut me off first!

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.340
So you have to pass him?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.580
Fine, it's no big deal.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.770
Has anyone placed an order?

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.180
There will be a prompt.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.060
No orders yet?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.420
We can't even cover the gas cost.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.700
Well, you're aware of that?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.610
Didn't you listen to the training?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.420
Hurry and find a place to rest.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.180
Where should I go?

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.940
Wherever you need to.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.980
Still no orders?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.490
Just waiting like this?

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.300
Yeah,

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.250
what are we even waiting for?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.890
For a good start!

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.420
Why take off your shoes?

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.980
My feet are sore.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.060
I'm just going to massage them.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.610
Why do it here?

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.770
What?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.180
Should we find a bar instead?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.370
Why wait

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.940
under a tree?

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:05.850
Jialu,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.890
what's wrong with you?

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.730
I just want to know,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.980
why a tree?

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.010
A tree?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.730
Are you crazy?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.130
You want a treat?

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.820
Huh?

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.980
You have a new order.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.420
It's one kilometer away.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.100
Please grab the order soon.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.730
Order successfully grabbed.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.730
Please arrive at the location

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.580
within 10 minutes.

What did I say?

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.010

what are we even waiting for?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.060
Wait a minute!

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:36.890
Let's take a photo

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.850
and send it to Jiaqi.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.300
This is our first deal.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.420
Hurry, we'll run out of time!

Wait, is this the right way?

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.490
The GPS is with you.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.290
Why ask me?

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.980
The GPS app freezes up!

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.700
Hurry,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.700
pull over!

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.700
Am I your uncle?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.620
What's wrong?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.810
When I told you to turn left,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.770
why didn't you turn?

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:39.860

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.180
What's that got to do with the GPS?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.180
It's up to us!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.010
It's up to us?

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.290
Then do something!

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.250
I was busy driving.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.330
You didn't even check the GPS,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.250
just babbling there!

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.860
What's wrong?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.940
I forgot to mention.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.700
You guys can stop by the house at lunch.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.810
I've prepared food for you.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.660
No need.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.380
When we're hungry,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.080
we'll just find a restaurant

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.660
and grab something to eat.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.700
How much did you earn?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.770
You're still eating out?

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.770
I'll pack it for you

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.010
in a thermal food box.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.900
Come pick it up.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.220
Thanks, Mom.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.490
Figured it out?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.490
Look at my judgment.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.090
Sharp, right?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.730
What's it to you?

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.290
It's because of the GPS.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.290
With this efficiency,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.140
we can grab

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.490
two more orders before noon.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.330
It's been smooth.

Didn't you say it's 10 minutes away?

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.380
If you don't show up, I'll cancel it.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.090
Go ahead! Don't talk to me like that!

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.730
We're here, buddy!

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.050
Speak nicely.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.490
We'll lose money if he leaves a bad review.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.770
Sorry, everyone.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.290
Sorry about that.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.420
Step aside.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.770
Move!

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.520
Sorry.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.050
Be careful.

Sorry.

Make way.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.380
Move!

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.570
Move a little to the left!

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.730
What are you doing?

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.140
Move!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.700
Sorry about that.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:39.940
Can you move this?

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.530
The car's coming.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.810
Come on.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.570
Let's go.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.940
Move this side!

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.940

we only earned fifty.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.680
You have a new order.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.310
We still need to eat anyway.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.290
New order.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.570
Why not pick up the lunch first?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.620

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.380
I just heard a huge gossip

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.660
about some colleagues.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.380
What is it?

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.980
But I'm not sure.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.420
Stop teasing,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.220
just tell me.

I've never seen a woman

kiss someone like that.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.660
It really opened my eyes.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.050
She's from our company?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.090
No wonder

What did I say earlier?

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.180
If you can't tell what your job is,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.860
you'll lose sooner or later.

Be careful.

He's already made me look bad.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.250
I don't care if he does it again.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.220
I've never said this before,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.660
but I've always thought

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.730
you're a good leader.

But should I

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.570
really trust you?

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.220

But that night at the bar,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.460
someone messed with it.

The next morning,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.770
I woke up

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.050
I had to suspect you.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.140
Does it even matter if I say it wasn't me?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.860
At least let me hold on to some belief

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.940

One more piece of advice:

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.090
don't trust anyone

in the company.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.420
She probably hasn't been back for days.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.460
Could she have run away?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.380
As long as that old hag

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.290
is still breathing,

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.980
she can't run.
