00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.700
I'll take it.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.890
The moment you hear it's close to home

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.420
with no lifting involved, you're all in.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.420
Didn't you say I'm the elder?

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.060
If I'm the elder,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.420
shouldn't I be setting an example?

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.220
None of this makes any sense.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.770
You're something else, seriously.

What time are you coming to pick up the food?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.010
I've already got everything ready here.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.700
In a bit.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.250
Your good son

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.850
assigned me another job again.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.010
Said it's near our place.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.850
Later, give all the food

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.890
to Jialu.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.370
At my age,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.250
what am I eating for anyway?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.100
I'm not eating.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.100
So many issues.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.770
If you're not eating, then nobody eats.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.490
Honestly...

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.300
Oh, give it a rest.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.820
Aren't I the elder?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.980
This elder will set an example for you.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.610
Right?

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.220
I'll carry it up myself later.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.530
You don't have to lift a finger.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.850
Just stand there and watch.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.610
Get up.

Stop putting on an act here.

How can this be placed here?

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.490

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.580
to invite it from a master.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.580
Can it really stay here?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.100
Move it inside.

This is Lord Guan, right?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.490
You can't say "move."

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.220
You have to say "invite."

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.370
Right.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.370
Isn't that so?

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.940
As the saying goes,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.010
when the God of Wealth enters, you must first honor the gods.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.650
So,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.180
now that Lord Guan has arrived,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.850
there needs to be a small ritual

to invite the God of Wealth inside.

after I split up with Jialu,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.290
I went to a shop

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.660
called Peterfu.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.010
I saw they were short-handed,

so I figured I'd lend a hand.

that Lord Guan was something he'd invited in

He said it was bad luck

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.290
because I, a stinking hauler,

Of all people, I had to run into you.

That was my luck for the whole year.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.860
I went through hell

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.900
to invite it to my doorstep,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.570
and you sent it away in one move.

You did that just to mess with me, didn't you?

No.

I didn't rush.

You are the ones left to pay it back.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.210
Everything that happened today

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.490
was brought on by your son.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.780
What exactly do you want?

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.170
I want you to go and apologize.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:12.530
What?

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.090
Me?

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.050
Apologize?

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:15.420
Are you out of your mind?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.340
Are you going or not?

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.170
I am not going.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.940
Not going, right?

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.490
Fine.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.740
Get out now!

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.650
Telomerase, right?

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.340
Automatically synthesized too?

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.820
If you could really do that,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.130
you would already have a Nobel Prize.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.530
What are you trying to pull here?

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.420
I am running a business.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.210
Fifty-nine percent

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.010
fullerene essence?

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.010
If that were real,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.130
you would have gone bankrupt long ago.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.170
Put that down.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.260
Where is the production license?

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.490
Where is the hygiene permit?

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.010
Product standards and batch numbers.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.260
There is no expiration date either.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.380
None.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.940
No!

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.170
None of it!

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.340
There is nothing at all!

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.490
Stop smashing them!

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.940
Do you want me to keep going?

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:48.980
Or should I call

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.010
the market regulators and the drug authority?

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.690
I will go.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.050
I will go, okay?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.980
Go apologize right now.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.980
Then shut this shop down.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.090
If I see

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.420
you selling these unlicensed products again,

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.740
you are finished.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.050
It is nothing.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.050
It is nothing.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.780
It is nothing.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.570
You went out drinking again, right?

Chu Dan is back.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.820
How was Spain?

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.530
You listened for so long.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.820
Did you find anything?

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.050
Are you going to a part-time job?

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.300
See you tomorrow.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.940
He is a good person.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.900
Maybe I just do not understand him.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.490
There is someone who seems to understand me.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.570
And I understand her too.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.340
She understands me.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.300
That makes me feel really sad.
