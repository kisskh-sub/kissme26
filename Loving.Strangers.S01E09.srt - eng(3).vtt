00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.980
You're holding the company back!

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.450
Don't you even

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.690
realize this?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.530
Let me be clear.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.860
If you end up

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.980
harming the company's interests,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.980
don't blame me for not warning you.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.740
Boss,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.980
should we

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.140
change the plan?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.410
Our dept

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.570
only does technical assessments.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.380
Mr. Gao is something else.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.810
He was just blowing up at Jiang

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.690
in front of so many people.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.900
He didn't give Jiang any face at all.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.450
No matter what,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.380
Jiang has been working here

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.570
for over ten years.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.620
But who's he really working for?

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.530
Just look at his shifts

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.650
these two years,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.450
moving from R&D to PV.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.380
Even though both are director positions,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.690
the difference between them

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.690
is huge.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.740
So,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.860
his personal case

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.290
is worth studying

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.570
and we can learn a lesson from it.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.450
If you don't want to end up like him,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.570
don't repeat

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.930
whatever he's done.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.020
Back in school,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.340
your junior used to suck up to you.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.100
And now he's your boss,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.260
and always trying to trip you up.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.690
Who wouldn't feel terrible?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.530
That's his problem.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.740
The workplace isn't where

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.740
you find your emotional balance.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.930
When his junior

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.500
becomes his superior,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.620
he should just walk away.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.650
He wouldn't have ended up

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.290
in this situation,

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.260
totally pinned down,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.770
and waiting

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:00.740
to be kicked out.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.930
Zhiyuan...

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.810
looks like I'm really getting old.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.380
Unlike you,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.860
always so young.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.140
My body feels like...

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.570
it weighs a thousand pounds.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.770
Get up!

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:02.690
Mom?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.690
Why didn't you knock?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.810
My son...

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.020
why haven't you gotten married yet?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.980
Why did you guys

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.290
end up in one bed?

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.220
I fell down last night,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.810
and I couldn't be bothered to climb back up.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:23.290
Get up.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.530
Get up.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.930
Mom,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.930
you can't do this!

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.620
Mom, you can't.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.340
One's my brother,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.170
and one's my son.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.450
When you both were young,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.570
I changed your diapers!

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.020
Sis...

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.810
What's there to be shy about?

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.650
You know I'm almost fifty.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.930
Can you show some respect

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.450
for a working person like me?

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.260
What kind of working person

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.020
sleeps in late

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.290
at this hour?

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.900
Hurry up and get to work.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.050
Jiaqi does

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.810
both mental and physical work.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.050
Has he ever said he's tired?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.140
Now he's walking to work,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.650
full of energy.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.620
Don't blame me for being biased.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.260
You should learn from him!

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.020
Jiaqi,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.530
your body weighs just 100 pounds.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.980
It's your heart feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.340
A perfect place for relaxation,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.220
a scenic retreat in the suburbs.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.570
Lia Resort,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.860
your natural oxygen bar,

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.450
bringing your heart back to nature.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.140
[Chu Dan: Feeling refreshed now.]

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.930
Even with your own pets,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.140
you wouldn't greet them with your feet, right?

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.580
What job are you taking?

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.820
We're hauling goods.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.930
Why are you ending up with a human model?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.780
A human model?

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.340
What's wrong?

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.620
Are you getting interested

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.490
in a fake person?

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.210
No, I just think she looks familiar.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.170
Enough.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.210
You need to get a girlfriend.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.170
Is it working or not?

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.820
Why is delivering this stuff

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.730
so troublesome?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.580
Such a small job,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.650
can't you do it by yourself?

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.490
Why bring me?

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.490
You're blaming me now?

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.170
Go talk to the security.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.140
Who knew?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.160
He won't let the car in.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.250
Can't I carry it myself?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.930
You always cause trouble.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.170
Hello.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.900
Hi.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.340
We're the delivery team.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.580
Hello?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.170
We're downstairs right now.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.650
Please open the door access.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.820
Open the access!

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.380
Miss.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.100
Open the access!

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.650
This is a KTV, not your house.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:11.580
What's going on?

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.100
Our customer's drunk.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.900
Ask her,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.010
can we just leave it by the door?

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.210
Or we'll leave it

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.010
by the door.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.650
You can grab it later.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.580
Are you her friend?

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.450
Please help her out.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.860
She's too drunk.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.380
No. We're the delivery team.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.140
I'll pay for the delivery fee!

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.100
Two hundred.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.100
Two hundred?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.930
Two hundred.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.860
You'll give two hundred, right?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.820
Fine.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.410
Okay.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.580
Please give me the address.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.730
Okay, got it.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:35.860
What now?

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.540
Just took a job.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.100
She's drunk. We're picking her up.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.780
We'll get two hundred for it.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.380
I'm not going.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.730
We're picking her up for two hundred!

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.140
Isn't that better than hauling goods?

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.210
Are you going or not?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.860
I refuse to go.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.650
Jiang Jialu!

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.820
It won't let us through?

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.250
No worries.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.340
We can go.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:19:59.900
It's okay.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.100
Don't burn yourself.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.650
Hello.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.010
Was this your order?

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.010
You'll pay two hundred?

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.900
We're leaving!

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:36.650
Let's go.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.490
We're leaving now.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.210
Let's go.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.550
Time is running out.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.450
Why are you so late?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.250
We're leaving.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.930
Can you make it?

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.930
Take care.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.860
Move.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.690
Director?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.860
You got the wrong person.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.650
Let's go.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.210
Director...

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.010
Director...

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.780
Do you know her?

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:17.690
Let's go.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.060
Director...

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.620
Move.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.620
Hello, Director!

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.860
Look...

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.410
Director...

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.380
Director...

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.690
You scumbag.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.010
You're going home too?

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:43.450
Oh, carpooling.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.620
That sounds good.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.010
Let's drink more when we get home.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.380
Who is she?

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.800
I don't know her.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.260
Your hand...

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.620
Be gentle.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.690
I'll leave you here, okay?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.010
I'm bringing you over.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.900
