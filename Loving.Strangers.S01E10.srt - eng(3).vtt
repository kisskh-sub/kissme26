[Episode 10]

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.260
Let's talk outside.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.260
Does it make any difference?

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.980
You're already a month and a half late on rent.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.660
I don't think I need to spell it out.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.940
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.500
You should just move out.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.170
You've got some nerve.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.100
You actually leave

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.130
an elderly person

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.260
who can't take care of herself home alone.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.380
to her

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.570
in my place,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.890
how am I supposed to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.940
sell this place later?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.540
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.500
I'm only

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.570
telling the truth.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.660
Besides,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.570
when I rented the place to you,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.850
I made it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.690
very clear.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.500
And you promised

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.690
only you would live here.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.100
That's why I gave you a low rent.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.170
Turns out my kindness

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.820
was misplaced.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.410
My grandma just has trouble getting around.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.060
Nothing will happen to her.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.170
Give me two more days.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.820
I'll settle the rent as soon as possible.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.170
Fine.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.940
I'll give you three days.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.780
If you can't pay by then,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.610
please move out.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.100
If everyone were like you,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.570
how could we landlords survive?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.290
Jeez.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.540
It's okay.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.260
It's settled. Don't worry.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.260
I'm sorry

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.660
to bring this to you.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.940
It's alright.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.340
The landlady is nice.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.100
You can stay here.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.780
No need to worry.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.380

Who's calling you?

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.780
Probably a wrong number.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.850
I'm popping down to grab a coffee.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.250
I'll get you one.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.020
Aren't I the only person

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.220
who calls this number?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.220
Special case.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.810
WA on the rocks.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.050
Good mood?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.700
You're still meeting the woman

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.580
when they're about to catch you by the tail.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.490
I thought you were more capable than this.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.050
I was waiting to see a show.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.340
Didn't pull it off?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.730
Didn't you say

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.810
you'd get some juicy photos

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.700
and get Jiang Jiaqi kicked out?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.170
I have something more direct.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.980
I gave you what I should.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.370
I expect your stuff to match.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.100
Listen to the recording.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.020
I found some leads.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.050
Might be enough

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.730
to flush him out.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.930
Photos of Gu Chen's home.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.340
I pulled some strings

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.050
and got

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.290
the cleaning lady

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.250
to snap a few photos.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.980
I've gone through them dozens of times.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.810
Nothing obvious.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.980
Take another look from your angle.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.410
Maybe

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.930
you'll catch something

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.850
I missed.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.980
Do we really need

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.250
to go this far?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.290
How did you get this?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.850
Anything else?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.140
Isn't this enough?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.220
Send the recording to the Inspection Office.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.370
Secret filming

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.410
the CEO.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.370
Just that alone

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.930
should be enough to get Jiang Jiaqi fired.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.780
This kind of recording won't hold up.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.370
And remember.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.810
Don't get me involved.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.220
You won't know

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.020
where the spotlight will land.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.250
So there's something hidden

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.290
in those photos?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.780
Pang Jian handled this in a pretty disgusting way.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.660
But it's still a dead end.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.100
My house is clean.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.850
Then send the recording to the Inspection Office.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.580
If they dig up

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.410
the photos,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.410
that gives us the evidence.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.140
Send the recording to the Inspection Office mailbox.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.170
Okay.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.020
Even if you don't want to pick a side,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.540
you'll still need to keep yourself safe.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.780
If they're set on

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.170
taking you down,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.290
you'd better have a gun in your hand

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.700
to stay alive.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.730
I have no way back.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.410
I can only go all in.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.220
But you still have a choice.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.490
If you switch over to Gu Chen now,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.410
it's not too late.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.980
I'm just a researcher.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.170
I don't want to climb the ladder.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.810
There's no need to get involved in those.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.290
I really want to ask

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.410
what exactly is going on

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.780
between you and Gu Chen?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.250
There's no beef.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.930
We're just not the same kind of people.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.370
Be honest.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.020
Why do you

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.810
hate him so much?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.020
Last year,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.490
we ran into each other in the elevator.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.410
He suddenly smiled at me.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.700
That's it?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.370
He smiled at you?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.810
Someone who never talks to you

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.660
suddenly

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.580
acts friendly.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.540
Doesn't that feel off?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.020
I knew right then

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.980
he must've done something.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.010
I just hadn't figured it out yet.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.010
Need the bathroom?

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:05.300
The moon looks beautiful tonight.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.980
Still busy?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.130
Did you eat?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.420
Yeah.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.650
I'm heading to the mart.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.130
Want me to pick anything up?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.730
No need.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.130

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.370
taken care of your grandma on your own?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.610
I should go.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.650
Zhou Yu'an.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.250
You're kind.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.060
♪I look at you, like at another me♪

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:38.340
♪My heart is locked up, never free♪

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:47.940
♪Sometimes I go with it, spinning like a top♪

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:58.780
♪No one to tell my secrets to, so I stay silent♪

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:07.740
♪Loud is the echo I buried deep♪

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:17.500
♪How I crave a single reply♪

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.460
♪Lonely souls are sand in the wind♪

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.260
♪With nowhere to settle...♪

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.490
Zhou Yu'an.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.050
You're kind.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.490
Director Jiang,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.420
the company laptops have arrived.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.050
Please sign here

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.980
so I can collect them.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.660
Okay.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.530
Isn't everyone getting one?

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.290
Yeah, everyone gets one.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.770
Include Zhou Yu'an as well.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.010
But she's a contractor.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.860
We've never

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.900
issued laptops to contractors.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.660
She works for Sen'an too.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.180
Her performance reviews

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.380
come through our department, right?

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.420
Exactly.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.900
It's just one more name.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.220
Fine, I'll do it.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.050
Which character is her name?

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.530
Who looks after your grandma

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.620
while you're at work?

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.010
A friend helps out when they can.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.140
Zhou Yu'an.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.660
It's a good name.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.530
My son's name

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.420
also has "An" in it.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.660
Before the child was born,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.770
I had all kinds of expectations.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.530
But the moment he's born,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.810
there's only one wish left.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.050
I hope he lives safely and well
["An" means "safely and well"]

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.420
for his whole life.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.530
He will.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.660
He was born into a good family.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.420
No matter what kind of family it is,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.770
parents

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.620
love their children.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.940
Some parents see their children

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.810
as a burden.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.010
Move a bit to the right.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.250
Can you turn?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.900
Give it a push on your end.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.530
I am.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.180
Can you move it that way?

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.860
Can you turn it?

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.620
Hey. You're on top. Give it a push.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.290
I can't get a grip. It's slipping.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.250
I'm done.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:23.770
Come on.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.010
We're almost at the door.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.220
Hurry up.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.770
Didn't you hear that crack?

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.980
Hang in there.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.090
Why are you taking orders?

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.900
I didn't. I turned it off.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.220
Tips?

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.140
[Tip]
Isn't this your human model?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.660
What's wrong?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.980
You took off too hard.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.290
Don't bring her up again.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.380
You talk like you have a grudge against her.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.330
Is she the one

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.180
who couldn't act?

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.490
Yeah. Her.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.860
Because of her,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.380
I ended up like this.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.900
Didn't you win

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.010
that international award?

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.770
Everyone at your company

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.050
was supporting you.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.180
They were.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.010
I shot my first film

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.380
not long after.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.180
Who knew

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.980
I'd run into

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.530
a female lead who couldn't act at all?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.250
You were the director, weren't you?

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.380
You called the shots.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.700
You could've replaced her

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.420
with someone better.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.700
I wanted to.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.570
The investors wouldn't allow it.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.700
I coached her for days, but nothing worked.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.660
I had no choice but to shoot it.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.220
If she acted badly, that was on her.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.860
But that shouldn't have ruined you

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.620
for years.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.860
I was the director.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.140
The film came out

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.180
and flopped on its first day.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.810
Word got around fast.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.050
No one dared hire me again.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:51.940
And of course,

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.700
no one hired her either.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.660
Quick.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.860
Two catties each.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.490
This and this.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.220
Okay.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.570
Scan here.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.140
Take your stuff.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.380
Why didn't you lend a hand

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.490
when we were carrying the mattress?

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.010
Fine.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.940
Close the door for me.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.180
Director Jiang.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.900
What a coincidence.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.490
What a coincidence.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.490
Yeah.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.660
I was passing by to buy some fruit.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.490
How did you find me?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.220
I didn't. I passed by here.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.860
That act was terrible.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.220
If I had a monitor,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.380
I'd replay it for you.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.980
Was it terrible?

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.940
I...

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.700
Be honest.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.660
Were you following us?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.490
What do you want?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.180
Why would she follow you?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.700
You're Director Jiang's...

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.290
I'm his uncle.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.250
That explains it.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.700
You two

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.860
do look alike.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.860
Do we?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.290
Uncles look like their nephews,

00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.900
right?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.700
How could I take after him?

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.900
My bad.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.140
It's fine.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.580
Director Jiang.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.620
What is it?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.620
Wait a second.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:13.860
Can we take a photo?

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.050
For what?

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:16.860
Head back already.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.100
I'm really busy today.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.180
Maybe next time.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.100
Okay.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.580
Alright. Bye.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.490
Bye, Mr. Jiang.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.940
What do you want to say?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.380
Director Jiang,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.940
are you doing fine?

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.010
What?

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.010
Did you come to see how miserable I am?

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.730
I'm the miserable one.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.980
After that film

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.980
with you,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.530
my company terminated my contract.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.010
I haven't landed a role since.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.490
Good for you. Bye.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.010
Director Jiang.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.140
I bought these for you.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.770
Thank you...

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.490
I don't want it.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.490
Thank you for sending me home that day.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.140
What exactly do you want?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.380
Nothing.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.490
I honestly feel happy

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.220
seeing you again.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.730
Just seeing you makes me happy.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.180
Director Jiang,

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.730
if I want to drink next time,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.220
I'll ask you to join me.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.660
I don't drink.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.460
Take them back.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.980
Director Jiang, please take it.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.810
I'll go now. Bye.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.290
Jialu,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.140
don't you think that was a bit too convenient?

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.490
She just shows up

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.490
out of nowhere.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.660
Do you think it's fate brought you both together,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.570
or is it written in the stars?

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.980
Tough luck instead?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.980
Oh, come on.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.050
It was obviously staged.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.770
Her acting hasn't improved at all.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.140
She can't even

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.900
fake a chance encounter properly.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.010
Really?

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.050
I thought it did look kind of staged.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.490
Why do you think she went there?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.530
To get revenge?

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.290
Revenge?

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.380
How?

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.220
Poison the fruit?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.490
You're that old.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.570
Why are you still greedy for food?

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.180
It's probably not poison.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.250
But I think that girl

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.290
is a little off.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.900
Who buys that many lemons?

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.860
That's too sour.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.220
Oh, lemons.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.700
Why are you so sour?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.290
But you never know.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.220
How can you be sure without tasting?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.860
What if it's sweet?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.220
Right?

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.530
I'm serious, Jialu.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.420
Try one.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.490
See if it's sour or sweet.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.330
Chi, you try too.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.220
Try it.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.050
See if it's sweet or not.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.810
Stuff your face.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.860
These days

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.940
have been tough on everyone.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:49.980
Mr. Gu

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.900
wants to thank you all

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.940
for your hard work.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.010
So we're having a company dinner.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.620
Let's keep striving

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.730
for Sen'an!

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.380
- Great! - Great!

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.220
Everyone must come.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.700
Eating together like this would be awkward.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.620
They might as well give us cash.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.330
We could have our own department dinner.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:07.980
That's better.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.570
They tell us to go, so we just go.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.700
It's free anyway.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.380
We get to drink.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.770
Zhou Yu'an.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.940
You should come too.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.380
Join the dinner.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.530
Boss.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.700
Listen to this.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.860
Photos of Gu Chen's home.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.420
I pulled some strings

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.460
and got

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.660
the cleaning lady...

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.530
Who sent this? Do we know?

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.250
No.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.530
It was an anonymous tip.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.940
Anonymous?

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.380
Should we report it?

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.490
Hold it.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.810
Mr. Gu,

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.050
you see,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.290
Pang Jian is already gone.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.940
As for how I should deal with this,

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.220
I thought I should

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.220
let you know.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.660
During the dinner,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.010
take someone and look into it.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.290
Try to find some proof.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.620
That way, they won't have anything to say.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.220
You're backing me. I know.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:22.330
Yes.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.570
It's almost seven.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.860
Maybe you should ask Mr. Gao

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.730
to start with the cold dishes.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.730
You ask. I don't dare.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.010
I'm starving.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.700
Here you go.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.860
Prawn crackers.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.570
Thank you.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.330
There you go.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.770
Take this to her.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.570
Boss said you can start eating.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.140
- Thanks. - Thanks.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.860
I talked to a friend last night.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.730
My friend said

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.490
I'm too kind.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.860
But life treats me hard.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.330
Go pour some water for everyone.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.700
Pour your own.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.810
Can't you read the room?

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.810
Who else here

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.900
should be doing this but you?

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.940
People like you only stay visible

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.050
by being useful.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.490
If I take this from you,

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.250
what do you have left?

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.900
I'll do it. I'll pour.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.570
Stand up.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.180
Stand up.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.860
Hello, Mr. Gu.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:45.900
Hello, Mr. Gu.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.570
How nice.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.050
Sorry.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.460
I was on a conference call.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.010
So I'm late.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.900
My apologies.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.810
No, not at all.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.770
You're not late.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.810
It's fine.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.530
Sit, everyone.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.530
You don't have to stand.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.860
Over there.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.250
Mr. Gu is here.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.250
Start serving.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.770
- Okay. - Okay.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.770
Look carefully.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.330
Got it.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.860
Wow. Amazing.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.900
Chen, you...

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.290
Oh my.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.700
You can really drink.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.010
Come on, everyone.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.980
Let's raise a glass

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.050
for Mr. Gu.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.700
Yeah.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.290
No need.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.730
Tonight is just for celebrating

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.460
and relaxing.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.290
You don't have to do this.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.810
Mr. Gu, just one around.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.860
- Right. - We all hope Sen'an

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.810
will keep growing

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.700
under your leadership.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.620
Right?

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.210
Yes.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.610
To Mr. Gu.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.290
- To Mr. Gu. - To Mr. Gu.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.490
To everyone. Cheers.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.290
Only the PV

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.290
hasn't come to toast yet.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.010
Director Jiang.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.050
I'll go.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.460
Yeah, right.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.770
But...

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.330
Director Jiang.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.860
Patience.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.290
Come.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.050
Mr. Gu.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.700
Beer isn't right though.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.140
We're all on baijiu, and you...

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.010
Have this.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.330
Mr. Gu, I toast you.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.330
Director Jiang.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.860
Are you keeping a goldfish in there?

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.010
There's a rule at the table.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.660
You owe a penalty shot if you didn't finish your drink.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.810
It's fine.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.810
Director Jiang

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.010
never likes this drinking culture.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.900
He was like this back in school.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.490
It's been years.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.010
You haven't changed.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.860
You've been in the real world this long.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:40.900
You can't still act

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.090
like you're on campus.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.770
I don't care.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.380
I say

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.810
drinking shows character.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.290
If your drinking is bad,

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.860
your character is bad.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.900
That's more like it.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.330
No rush, Director Jiang.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.620
There's a second round.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.810
Come on. Pour him another.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.140
Give me some too.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.530
This shot.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.620
As your direct superior,

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.010
I'll drink with you.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.490
Let's toast

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.490
Mr. Gu together.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.250
Come on.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.140
Let's toast Mr. Gu.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.220
Why is it so hard

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.860
to get you to drink?

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.420
Leaders,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.940
I'll drink

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.330
for my boss.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.290
I'll drink too.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.330
He's your boss?

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.900
But does he look like one?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.570
Such a coward.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.010
Your staff even needs to cover for you.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:53.900
Forget it.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.700
Stop drinking.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.380
Come.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.140
Mr. Gu.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.620
Don't let them ruin your mood.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.660
Let's drink.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.460
Let's drink. Come on.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.460
Fill them all.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.700
- Pour some for me. - Here.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.140
Come on.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.530
Let's toast Mr. Gu.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.610
What are you still doing here?

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.050
Just go.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.570
Let's drink.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.740
Come on.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.530
Take it easy.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.130
Thank you all

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.380
for always looking after me.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.340
Make sure to restore everything.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.460
[Su Gengsheng: We didn't find anything.]

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.900
You guys keep drinking.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.900
I need to head out.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.090
You're leaving?

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.900
I'll walk Mr. Gu out.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.570
Bye, Mr. Gu.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.650
Bye, Mr. Gu.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.900
- Mr. Gu. - Bye.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.820
Mr. Gu.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.940
Hold on.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.380
Our boss toasted you

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.570
with a full pot just now.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.380
I saw

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.650
you only had one glass.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.860
He's your senior.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.050
You should finish this pot.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:28.690
I'll drink with you.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.650
Okay?

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.820
Another time.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.740
We have more chances to drink.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.420
Drink less.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.210
Mr. Gu.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.170
When you were in school,

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.490
did you drink like this

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.650
- with your seniors? - You're drunk.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.460
Let go.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.820
I just want to ask.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.340
Why are you going after

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.130
my boss?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.530
Let go!

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.570
Stop making a scene.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.130
Come on!

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.900
What's wrong?

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.530
I'm just asking Mr. Gu.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.050
- Why is he giving my boss a hard time? - Stop it.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.460
- What's wrong with that? - Who gives you a hard time?

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.010
Seriously?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.050
- Watch your tone. - You're targeting PV

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.610
- and my boss. - No.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.940
- This is your guy, right? - That's enough!

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.540
If you can't handle him, I will.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.010
Move.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.090
- No. - He's drunk.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.650
So what if he's drunk?

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.650
- Stop it. - Even so,

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.090
is that how he talks to his superior?

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.050
- Enough. Stop it. - So rude.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:15.900
I wasn't talking to you.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.300
- Stop it. - I was talking to Mr. Gu.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:17.730
Move.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.830
Move!

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.460
Boss.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.050
I'm fine.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.690
Sorry.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.130
This is on me.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.650
I'll apologize for him.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.380
Enough!

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.570
You only

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.570
made me look worse.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.380
Do you understand?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.490
Boss.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.690
I'm sorry.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.690
Don't overthink it.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.820
Let's just do our jobs

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.260
and keep a clear conscience.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.170
I think

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.340
what he said makes sense.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.170
Your junior

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.010
has gotten ahead of you.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.170
Isn't that because

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.570
he's more capable?

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.380
Why don't you

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.530
swallow your pride?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.210
What's so hard about that?

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.300
In a situation like this,

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.170
is it really your junior who's wrong,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.260
or is it you?

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.010
To say the least,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.820
even if

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.490
you don't think about yourself,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.130
shouldn't you

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.300
think about those who work under you?

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.530
Shouldn't you think about us?

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.490
Didn't we end up like this

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:51.050
because you were too much of a coward?

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.860
Gross.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.820
Can you say something decent for once?

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.130
Did she

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.900
just slap me?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.010
I can't die yet.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.740
It's nothing.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.050
Nothing at all.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.140
[Loving Strangers]

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.340
What's the name of the neighborhood

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.010
Gu Chen lives in?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.530
Did you find something?

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.490
I think it's Yunxi Residence.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.610
I've been there when delivering food.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.900
I'm working late tonight.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.530
I'll be back later.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.260
Why don't you break up with her?

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:27.610
That's none of your business.
