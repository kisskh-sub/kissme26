00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:18.332
Therefore, in order
to heighten society's vigilance

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.543
against the dangers
of narcotics addiction,

00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:23.253
the Prosecution seeks
the sentence of death.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.839
Ten years in these robes…

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:29.426
…and I've learned one thing.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.510
I pledge…

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:31.595
I pledge…

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:34.348
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:36.683
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:39.895
- …to devote…
- …to devote…

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:42.814
…my loyalty to the President…

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:45.525
…my loyalty to the President…

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:50.989
…and the everlasting glory
of our homeland.

00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:53.950
Just because we wear the
same clothes and stand in the same place

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:56.453
doesn't mean we walk the same path.

00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:01.375
MILITARY POLICE

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.011
Some pledge their hearts

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:15.681
to the nation.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.100
Some

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.060
rise in its defense.

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:26.692
And some

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:29.319
betray it to its fall.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.198
Ah, I got it.

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.284
Baek Kitae knew
exactly what kind of path

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:38.161
he was choosing for himself.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:42.541
And what kind of bloodshed
it would demand.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:48.171
There's only one reason
men like him cry patriotism.

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:51.466
To line their own pockets

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.385
with the nation's name.

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:55.762
For me,

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:00.350
patriotism means fighting those bastards
to the bitter end.

00:02:59.576 --> 00:03:01.495
Geonyoung.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.955
Geonyoung!

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:08.502
Geonyoung!

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.215
Geonyoung!

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:17.135
Hyeeun.

00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:21.973
- Hyeeun!
- Geonyoung…

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:23.141
Hyeeun!

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.392
Geonyoung.

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:25.477
Hyeeun!

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.270
What are you doing here?

00:03:27.354 --> 00:03:29.314
Oh… Geonyoung!

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:30.857
So…

00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:34.778
Are you awake now?

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:37.030
Baek Kitae,
you son of a bitch!

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:41.368
Why did you tail
Director Hwang that day?

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:44.746
Did you kill him with Kang Daeil's help?

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.214
Hey!

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.466
What the hell are you up to, you bastard?

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.634
Ms. Jang Hyeeun.

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:00.220
You know Kim Minsu, right?

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:01.304
Your guitar instructor.

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:03.473
Under orders from the North,

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:06.685
he recruited factory girls
and formed an underground organization.

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:10.772
And the operation funds
he got from the North?

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:16.152
You, Ms. Jang Hyeeun,
were the one managing them.

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:19.197
You son of a bitch!
What the hell are you talking about?

00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:23.034
It was just money we pooled
for club activities…

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:31.251
Then,
I'm guessing your brother knew

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:33.837
that you're a commie.

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:37.173
Prosecutor Jang over there

00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.968
leaked internal information
on Kim Minsu's case,

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.929
- and you passed it on to him, right?
- No, that never happened!

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:45.056
No, Geonyoung did nothing wrong!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.141
Does that mean…

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.020
you did do something?

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.856
Hyeeun! Hyeeun, it's okay!

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.025
Hyeeun, it's okay. Stay calm!

00:04:55.108 --> 00:04:56.902
- You are…
- Trust me!

00:04:56.985 --> 00:04:59.613
…deeply involved with Kim Minsu.

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:01.239
Right?

00:05:05.493 --> 00:05:07.913
- Hyeeun!
- The thing is…

00:05:07.996 --> 00:05:09.539
Hyeeun! Don't say anything!

00:05:09.623 --> 00:05:12.751
Hyeeun! No! Don't say anything!

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:16.046
Hyeeun! Don't fall for that!

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.674
Hyeeun, it's okay!

00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:22.636
I, Kim Minsu, received
operation funds from the North

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.721
- …and ran an underground organization…
- No!

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:26.723
-…with Jang Hyeeun.
-Hyeeun, look at me!

00:05:26.806 --> 00:05:28.475
- Look at me! Trust me!
- Through her…

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.936
…older brother, Jang Geonyoung,
she passed me intel…

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.938
Baek Kitae,
you bastard! Come here!

00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:35.065
Come here! Talk to me!

00:05:35.148 --> 00:05:36.358
Talk to me, you bastard!

00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:38.151
You came after me…

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:42.113
without being ready for this?

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.544
This fight won't end
until one of us is dead.

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:01.132
And it sure won't be me.

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:06.304
Mr. Jang.

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:10.433
Can you see clearly now?

00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:19.067
MADE IN KOREA

00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:27.826
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:38.712
- What happened?
- Yesterday, Prosecutor Jang's sister

00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:42.215
was arrested by the KCIA
for violating the Anti-Communist Law.

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:44.968
Looks like they're trying
to drag Jang into it.

00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.847
Those cocky little bastards have
no sense of decency…

00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:51.266
How dare they go after a prosecutor?

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.227
Do they think
the prosecution sits under them?

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.064
This could shake the entire organization,
so we need to respond right away, sir.

00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:02.610
We'll lodge an official protest
and find a way to pull Jang out.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.532
What about that thing
you brought Chief Na last time?

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.451
It seemed like he was pleased with it.

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.703
We're in for an all-out war.

00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:12.787
Brace yourselves.

00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:14.038
Yes, sir.

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:21.296
So, how did your meeting go
with the President?

00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.174
Well,
CEO Kim of Seongwan Constructions

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.092
got his nomination,

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.429
and Taejong Group was given
a little more time.

00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:30.847
Congratulations, Chief.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.433
Chief Cheon won't be too happy
when he hears about this.

00:07:33.516 --> 00:07:34.893
What's he going to do?

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.228
This is what the President wants.
What can we do?

00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:38.772
Chief.

00:07:42.108 --> 00:07:43.151
What's going on?

00:07:44.903 --> 00:07:47.322
We just got an urgent call
from the Prosecutors' Office.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.325
It seems like the KCIA grabbed
one of their prosecutors.

00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:59.501
CHIEF OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
SECURITY SERVICE, CHEON SEOKJUNG

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:06.174
Chief Na, what brings you here?

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:09.469
You tell me.

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:12.889
I didn't want to get involved,

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:15.809
but I just heard something outrageous.

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:20.897
You know the entire Prosecutors' Office is
in an uproar right now, right?

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.275
Not really.

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:28.530
Did something happen?

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:37.330
Look, everyone knows
the KCIA is in your hands,

00:08:37.872 --> 00:08:39.374
but don't make it so obvious.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.169
The President always stresses

00:08:43.253 --> 00:08:46.381
that we should each stay
in our lane and do our jobs.

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:55.515
Meaning there are lines
we shouldn't cross.

00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:03.148
You say that, but you seem to be…

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:08.820
paying a lot more attention
to the prosecution these days.

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:21.249
With the election coming up,
the President has a lot on his mind.

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:28.381
Let's not take things too far

00:09:29.132 --> 00:09:31.926
and just focus on what each of us
is supposed to do.

00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:36.723
That's all I'm saying.

00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:41.728
I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.190
If I'd known about it,
I would've let you know right away.

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:48.902
But Baek went rogue on this,
and I couldn't…

00:09:48.985 --> 00:09:50.111
So you're saying…

00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:54.866
Baek Kitae arrested a prosecutor

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.660
without my permission?

00:09:57.744 --> 00:09:58.786
Yes, sir.

00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:01.372
But things are not looking too bad.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.752
We've got a solid case against the sister,
so even if the prosecution pushes back,

00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:07.962
-it won't be easy to get out of--
-Hey.

00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:09.297
Yes, sir?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.840
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:11.466 --> 00:10:13.176
Have you no control over Baek?

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:17.388
Do you or not?

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.559
I do, sir. I have control over him.

00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:24.270
- Do your job right.
- Yes, sir. I'll do it right.

00:10:24.354 --> 00:10:25.647
Do it right.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.856
Yes, sir. I will…

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.524
I'll do it right.

00:10:34.447 --> 00:10:35.448
WRITTEN STATEMENT

00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:36.658
As you can see,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.869
Kim Minsu sold your sister out
to save his own skin.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.081
If what he wrote there is true,

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.626
your sister could face
the death penalty for espionage.

00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:51.714
Using a public security case…

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:56.261
to screw me over?

00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:59.180
And dragging my sister into it too?

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:01.849
Mr. Baek Kitae.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.436
You think I'll just accept…

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:09.774
-these statements in court?
-Doesn't matter if you accept them or not.

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:13.820
If we push it through,
it'll hold enough weight in court.

00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:15.488
Come on, you know this already.

00:11:21.703 --> 00:11:24.080
If you want to save your sister, sign it.

00:11:24.163 --> 00:11:26.374
When you're given a chance, you take it.

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:28.126
You don't want your only sibling

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:31.004
to end up like your father, do you?

00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:42.515
Come on, outside.

00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:44.684
It's important.

00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:55.528
- Hey.
- What is it?

00:11:57.697 --> 00:12:01.117
I got chewed out
for pulling shit without reporting in.

00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:05.038
Orders are, let Jang go right away…

00:12:05.121 --> 00:12:07.081
…and focus on the Japan deal.

00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:08.833
I'll take care of it.

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.626
Take care of it how exactly?

00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:13.379
You know the election's
right around the corner.

00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:16.758
The amount of funds we secure now
will decide the game.

00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:19.093
That's exactly why I'm doing this.

00:12:20.303 --> 00:12:23.181
I need to deal with Jang for good
to focus on the deal--

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.892
It looks like the prosecutors
got Chief Na on their side.

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:29.228
The higher-ups already agreed
to take Jang out of play,

00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:31.189
so you just stick to business.

00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:34.734
You know that…

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.404
Chief Cheon never repeats himself, right?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.742
I've delivered his message then.

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:50.416
Next time, run it by me first, will you?

00:12:52.877 --> 00:12:54.087
Not cool.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.115
Come on out.

00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:30.206
Hold still. Hey, hang on.

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:32.750
Mr. Jang.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.627
The other day,

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.005
you asked me if I trusted Baek Kitae.

00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:41.425
I thought about it,

00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:45.638
and there's no reason
you and I can't get along.

00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:53.312
You son of a bitch.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:56.065
From now on, let's get along.

00:13:56.941 --> 00:13:58.526
You get what I'm saying?

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:00.903
I'll be in touch.

00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:04.490
Hey!

00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.492
Where's Hyeeun?

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.786
She's fine. Don't worry.

00:14:31.225 --> 00:14:32.226
Mr. Jang!

00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:41.027
Oh! What the heck…

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.196
Everything okay while I was gone?

00:14:44.488 --> 00:14:45.656
Pack your stuff.

00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:47.783
We're clearing out

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.953
and heading back to the office.

00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:52.830
What are you talking about, sir?

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:55.875
No more secret investigations.

00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:57.460
Mr. Jang.

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.046
Did something happen to you?

00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:03.716
We've got plenty of work piled up
at the office.

00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:09.180
From now on, we stick to our duty.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.400
What happened with Prosecutor Jang?

00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:23.569
We don't need to worry about him anymore?

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:26.697
He won't be able
to make a move anytime soon.

00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.242
Hmm… All right.

00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:31.535
Anyway, make sure
you deliver the goods on time.

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:33.788
My father's not as forgiving as I am.

00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:35.081
I keep my promises.

00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:38.334
What about the raw materials?

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:42.171
We can scale up production
as much as we want.

00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:43.923
The problem is securing the source.

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:48.094
Breaking into the Taiwan supply line
isn't easy, either.

00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:52.181
That's actually why I called.

00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:54.267
To hit the volume I set,

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.311
securing a stable supply comes first.

00:15:57.895 --> 00:15:59.730
Can you go overseas with me next week?

00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:03.651
There's someone we need to meet in Saigon.

00:16:08.864 --> 00:16:11.575
SAIGON, VIETNAM

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.412
Why aren't they moving?

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:20.042
Geez, what are they doing?

00:16:24.088 --> 00:16:26.340
The mango juice here is amazing.

00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:27.717
Hold on a second.

00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:33.014
Excuse me.

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:34.598
Two cups of mango juice, please.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:47.028
Oh, here you go.

00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:51.324
Ah…

00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:53.784
Did you hear the news?

00:16:53.868 --> 00:16:55.911
There was a big mess
in Nha Trang a few days ago.

00:16:55.995 --> 00:16:57.455
What happened?

00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.415
Apparently, inspectors came from back home

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:01.250
and turned the whole unit upside down.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:05.963
You know Captain Yoon, the one who got
caught skimming supplies with US soldiers?

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:08.049
He's been ordered back home.

00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.509
How do you even know all this?

00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:13.179
Come on. I've been out here
for over two years.

00:17:13.888 --> 00:17:16.265
I could call the Viet Cong
my brothers at this point.

00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:38.162
Lieutenant!

00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:39.872
Sir.

00:17:40.414 --> 00:17:42.249
The company commander is asking for you.

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.876
Someone's come from Seoul.

00:17:43.959 --> 00:17:45.961
From Seoul? Who?

00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:47.755
PERSONAL RECORD
NAME: BAEK KIHYUN

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:50.925
Korea Military Academy, Class 26.
Top of your class.

00:17:51.467 --> 00:17:53.386
Born in Japan,

00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:55.346
both parents deceased…

00:17:55.429 --> 00:17:57.306
HEAD OF SECURITY COMMAND
MAJOR WON DONGHYEOK

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.558
-Your brother's with the KCIA?
-Yes, sir.

00:18:01.977 --> 00:18:05.022
Man, it's hot, huh?

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:10.736
The temperature's lower than in Seoul,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.114
but it's the damn humidity
that drives you crazy.

00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:15.449
Is it always like this here?

00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:17.493
It's worse now during monsoon season.

00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:21.122
Listen.

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:24.041
Do you know why I came
all the way from Seoul?

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.212
What about why I called you in?

00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:30.172
I'm not sure, sir.

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:33.884
You were questioned
by Nam Sanguk before, right?

00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:37.930
-Did he say anything about me?
-Not that I recall, sir.

00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:41.267
Yeah?
Guess you two aren't that close.

00:18:42.518 --> 00:18:46.981
Well, that prick was always stuck-up,
coming from a fancy family.

00:18:47.064 --> 00:18:48.566
Good thing we shipped him off.

00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:52.236
What, you didn't know?

00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:55.239
That jerk got kicked out
of Security Command.

00:18:57.366 --> 00:18:59.827
Anyway, you look like
you've been through some shit.

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:02.788
Probably got more sense than he does.

00:19:02.872 --> 00:19:06.876
Though we'll have to see
if you measure up to your big brother.

00:19:07.793 --> 00:19:09.712
I'm sorry, but I don't follow.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.766
I'm saying I've got a job for you.

00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:24.769
What? You don't want to get promoted?

00:19:24.852 --> 00:19:26.103
That's not it, sir.

00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:29.190
Everyone who comes out here's
only got promotion on their mind, right?

00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:31.942
Isn't that why you're out here
slaving away?

00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:33.903
You'll start tomorrow.

00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:35.362
I'll clear a desk for you.

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:38.657
Get your bearings for a few days,
then you'll serve under Colonel Chu.

00:19:39.617 --> 00:19:42.828
You know Chu Gwangseop,
commander of the 29th Infantry Regiment?

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.622
Yes, I do, sir.

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:47.583
Go under him
and report every damn thing he does,

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:50.044
without leaving out a single detail.

00:19:51.003 --> 00:19:53.339
Do this right,
and Nam Sanguk's former post…

00:19:55.883 --> 00:19:57.468
will be yours.

00:20:11.273 --> 00:20:14.109
This is Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung,
the one I mentioned before.

00:20:14.735 --> 00:20:16.487
Come on, pour him a drink.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:24.578
I'm Jang Geonyoung.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:28.249
Let me pour you a drink, Chief Na.

00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:52.648
Even after all you've been through,
your spirit hasn't broken.

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:58.070
Mr. Jang, you're a true patriot, huh?
They're hard to come by.

00:20:58.654 --> 00:21:00.823
If you support the prosecution, sir,

00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:02.825
I'll bring clear proof

00:21:02.908 --> 00:21:06.912
that Chief Cheon Seokjung
is backing Baek Kitae.

00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:11.876
Rush in too soon,
and it'll backfire on you like last time.

00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:16.380
There's one thing I learned
during my recent detention at the KCIA.

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:19.466
The evidence to bring down
Chief Cheon will come

00:21:20.342 --> 00:21:21.844
straight from Baek Kitae himself.

00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:23.596
How would you make that happen?

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.764
First, we'll put Baek in custody…

00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:28.517
…and drive a wedge between the two.

00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:33.480
Cheon's the kind of guy who'll cut off
his tail first when things blow up.

00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:36.108
And Baek knows that well.

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:38.152
He'll do whatever he can

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:39.945
to save his own skin.

00:21:41.363 --> 00:21:43.324
Like an internal conflict?

00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:45.367
If you give me a chance…

00:21:47.328 --> 00:21:48.746
I'll get him no matter what.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.873
You may lower your head,

00:21:50.956 --> 00:21:54.168
but you're not the sort
to ever bow to anyone.

00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:56.462
If you're looking
for a blade against Cheon,

00:21:56.545 --> 00:21:58.088
he's not a bad choice, sir.

00:23:03.404 --> 00:23:04.405
Hey, you came.

00:23:10.536 --> 00:23:12.746
What do you want? Why'd you ask to see me?

00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:16.000
I just want to get closer to you.

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:18.043
Thinking of jumping ship?

00:23:22.715 --> 00:23:26.510
Well, I get it. At this rate,
Baek Kitae will push you aside

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:29.054
and take Hwang's place.

00:23:29.805 --> 00:23:30.973
Not you, Mr. Pyo.

00:23:34.018 --> 00:23:35.102
You're right.

00:23:35.686 --> 00:23:37.604
Let's be honest with each other.

00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:44.486
Lately, the President seems
to be pushing Chief Cheon away.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.280
Best to go with the flow, right?

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:51.076
How was your dinner with Chief Na?

00:23:52.536 --> 00:23:55.247
So you're interested in him as well, huh?

00:23:56.498 --> 00:23:57.750
How did you know about that?

00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.085
Work in the KCIA for over a decade,

00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:02.004
and you know everything.

00:24:05.632 --> 00:24:07.301
What can I do for you?

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:15.100
When Baek Kitae handed money
over to Cheon,

00:24:16.477 --> 00:24:18.437
you think that's all he did?

00:24:19.021 --> 00:24:20.022
Or what?

00:24:20.939 --> 00:24:22.316
Baek Kitae has

00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:25.527
a recording of Cheon.

00:24:27.446 --> 00:24:28.739
Bring it to me.

00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:31.742
If you do,

00:24:32.618 --> 00:24:33.744
it'll be you…

00:24:36.246 --> 00:24:38.123
who takes Hwang's seat.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.125
Not Baek Kitae.

00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:43.837
So?

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:45.881
How does that sound?

00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:47.758
Sounds good.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.555
CHEON SEOKJUNG

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.469
Where did you say
you were going? Saigon?

00:25:33.595 --> 00:25:34.596
Yeah.

00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:36.932
For how long?

00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:38.976
Not long.

00:25:39.643 --> 00:25:41.478
Just keep an eye on Jang Geonyoung for me.

00:25:42.187 --> 00:25:44.273
If anything happens, call me right away.

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.357
Got it.

00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:47.985
Hey, can I bum a smoke?

00:25:49.862 --> 00:25:52.906
You want to live till you're old and gray.
Why start again?

00:25:55.284 --> 00:25:56.869
Maybe because life's looking up.

00:25:57.578 --> 00:25:59.121
Got the craving back.

00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:00.664
I knew you wouldn't last forever.

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:04.793
The lighter.

00:26:04.877 --> 00:26:07.421
- You can have the rest of the pack.
- Thanks, man.

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:44.249
Security Command?
So, what's the big deal?

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:45.584
Goddamn bastards.

00:26:46.084 --> 00:26:47.711
I could just…

00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:50.255
Fucking hell.

00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:52.466
Hey, let's go.

00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:00.724
Let's go, kid.

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.560
Hey!

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:05.520
What the hell are you doing?

00:27:09.316 --> 00:27:10.317
Sir.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.069
Look at this clown.

00:27:14.655 --> 00:27:16.990
Major Lee from the Anti-Communist Bureau
recommended you?

00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:19.785
-Yes, sir.
-That's impressive, kid.

00:27:20.869 --> 00:27:23.163
You won over someone as strict as he is.

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:25.666
Not at all, sir.
It's an honor to serve under you.

00:27:29.753 --> 00:27:32.047
Colonel Chu Gwangseop.
Korea Military Academy, Class 11.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.924
Born in Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang-do.

00:27:34.007 --> 00:27:36.259
- Now, get the hell in.
- Yes, sir.

00:27:36.343 --> 00:27:37.844
He earned
the President's trust

00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:39.638
when he was with
the Capital Garrison Command,

00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:42.182
and was the first of his class
to get promoted.

00:27:42.265 --> 00:27:43.850
He never cared for combat,

00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:46.436
and spent his days
entertaining guests and partying.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.981
Sneaking out supplies was
just routine for him.

00:27:49.064 --> 00:27:51.191
The man's got quite the reputation.

00:27:52.901 --> 00:27:55.570
But this time,
it's on a whole different scale.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.367
There are some Vietnamese officers
colluding with local arms traffickers,

00:28:00.867 --> 00:28:04.162
and we have intel that Chu's been
in frequent contact with them lately.

00:28:32.065 --> 00:28:33.316
There he is.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.028
Soon to be our partner
who'll save us, Jason Chang.

00:28:36.111 --> 00:28:38.989
He's Taiwanese-American,
and has a firm grip on the smuggling route

00:28:39.072 --> 00:28:41.074
for raw materials used
to make Taiwanese meth.

00:28:41.158 --> 00:28:44.453
He's been busy pushing heroin here
in Saigon the last few years, though.

00:28:46.872 --> 00:28:49.207
I'm glad you got in touch.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:51.793
I didn't think you'd fly
all the way to Saigon.

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:54.129
As I mentioned on the call,

00:28:54.212 --> 00:28:56.798
I have a partner
I really want to introduce you to.

00:28:58.258 --> 00:29:01.511
Mr. Baek is in need of a large quantity
of raw materials.

00:29:02.137 --> 00:29:04.097
I told him you might be able to help.

00:29:04.848 --> 00:29:08.310
Well, I've never done business
with Koreans before.

00:29:09.478 --> 00:29:12.856
I don't want to waste my time
on a rookie and take a risk.

00:29:12.939 --> 00:29:14.399
It's just as I expected.

00:29:15.108 --> 00:29:16.777
He's worried because you're a rookie.

00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:21.406
Saigon has changed a lot.

00:29:23.617 --> 00:29:25.827
American soldiers are openly doing drugs.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.872
No wonder they lost the war.

00:29:29.372 --> 00:29:30.665
Were you in Vietnam?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.919
I was in the jungle in '65.

00:29:34.002 --> 00:29:37.714
Back then, the Americans had
some sense of justice.

00:29:38.507 --> 00:29:41.885
A lot of us died fighting
the Viet Cong in the jungle.

00:29:42.886 --> 00:29:45.764
We, the Americans, the Viet Cong.

00:29:50.644 --> 00:29:53.480
You must have made a lot of money, huh?

00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:58.151
The war is coming to an end now.

00:29:59.152 --> 00:30:00.946
Aren't you gonna make some money?

00:30:02.656 --> 00:30:03.657
See for yourself.

00:30:04.533 --> 00:30:06.785
You'll think differently when you see it.

00:30:25.804 --> 00:30:26.805
Oh…

00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:30.308
Sir!

00:30:32.144 --> 00:30:33.145
At ease.

00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:36.398
Wait here.

00:30:36.481 --> 00:30:37.482
Yes, sir.

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:45.157
Second floor, last room down the hall.

00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:49.286
Colonel Chu's meeting
a Vietnamese officer there today.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:26.907
Okay. So?

00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:30.035
Can you handle it
smoothly this time again?

00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:34.206
If you're smooth,
I'm smooth too.

00:31:48.261 --> 00:31:51.806
The items I deliver are all top-notch.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.058
You know that, right?

00:31:54.392 --> 00:31:57.687
What the Viet Cong wants
is not Korean weapons.

00:31:58.355 --> 00:32:01.816
They need the M16 or heavy machine guns
the Americans use.

00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:04.444
That's also possible.

00:32:05.195 --> 00:32:09.449
There are a few things we've skimmed
from the American soldiers.

00:32:10.784 --> 00:32:11.910
Good.

00:32:16.665 --> 00:32:17.666
Come in.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.805
Show me what you've got.

00:32:51.992 --> 00:32:54.577
Ever seen a rookie make
something like this?

00:32:55.412 --> 00:32:57.580
A 100% purity.

00:32:58.373 --> 00:32:59.624
What a beauty.

00:33:02.836 --> 00:33:03.837
Deal?

00:33:05.672 --> 00:33:06.756
Deal.

00:33:19.894 --> 00:33:21.813
If I arrest Baek Kitae,

00:33:23.064 --> 00:33:24.816
your sister goes to prison,

00:33:25.317 --> 00:33:26.651
and you, Mr. Baek Kihyun,

00:33:27.485 --> 00:33:29.863
might be forced out of the army too.

00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:33.366
It was really good.

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:13.073
Are you all right?

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.677
What are you doing here?

00:34:38.056 --> 00:34:40.183
- Hey, let's go!
- What happened to your face?

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.861
Hey, Baek! Let's go, kid!

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.822
What the hell are you doing?

00:34:57.325 --> 00:34:58.326
Out of the way!

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:09.671
President Park
is scheduled to hold a campaign rally

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:11.297
in Busan tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

00:35:11.381 --> 00:35:15.468
Large crowds are expected to gather
at the venue from early morning.

00:35:15.552 --> 00:35:18.304
After the rally, President Park will…

00:35:18.388 --> 00:35:20.849
When the President comes
to Busan tomorrow,

00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:23.268
Chief Cheon Seokjung
will accompany him, right?

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.270
I guess so.

00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:28.231
And that's our chance.

00:35:28.898 --> 00:35:31.401
- Hmm…
- While Cheon's out of Seoul,

00:35:32.861 --> 00:35:34.571
that's when we strike.

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:34.464
- Soyeong! Soyeong!
- Oh, Daeil!

00:36:34.547 --> 00:36:36.549
You don't have an umbrella? It's pouring!

00:36:37.133 --> 00:36:38.927
Did you bring what I asked for?

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:40.011
Yeah.

00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:45.391
I was worried Kitae might find out,
so I couldn't sneak out much. Sorry.

00:36:46.184 --> 00:36:49.270
If he finds out the stuff's hitting
Busan streets, he won't sit still.

00:36:49.354 --> 00:36:50.855
You sure about this?

00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:53.775
I'll figure out a way to get the money.
Just wait a little.

00:36:53.858 --> 00:36:56.611
Don't worry about it anymore.
This is all I need.

00:36:56.694 --> 00:36:58.321
How can I not worry?

00:36:58.404 --> 00:37:01.407
Neither you nor Kitae will tell me
what's going on--

00:37:01.491 --> 00:37:02.951
I said, don't worry about it!

00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:05.495
I'll…

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.665
I'll see you later.

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:11.668
Daeil.

00:37:18.925 --> 00:37:20.218
Sunyeong.

00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:28.768
Oh, oh!

00:37:29.644 --> 00:37:31.396
- Daeil!
- Hold still!

00:37:32.647 --> 00:37:33.773
No!

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:37.610
Daeil!

00:37:38.778 --> 00:37:39.779
Don't make this hard!

00:37:42.866 --> 00:37:44.325
Daeil!

00:37:44.409 --> 00:37:46.578
- Baek Soyeong!
- Let go!

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:50.081
No! Stop that!

00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:53.251
Let go of me! Let go!

00:37:57.213 --> 00:37:58.214
Kang Daeil.

00:37:59.632 --> 00:38:01.134
Hey, Kang Daeil!

00:38:02.844 --> 00:38:04.429
Damn it, you idiot!

00:38:04.512 --> 00:38:05.722
Hey, did you just dodge?

00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:07.891
You dodged? Huh?

00:38:09.183 --> 00:38:10.727
Are you just stupid?

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.729
Or you think I'm a goddamn joke?

00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:15.899
You had the fucking nerve to screw me over

00:38:15.982 --> 00:38:17.859
and still show up to see Baek Soyeong?

00:38:24.741 --> 00:38:25.950
Well…

00:38:29.078 --> 00:38:31.915
you can't do anything now anyway, right?

00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:34.959
The Narcotics Unit's been shut down.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.212
It's all over, isn't it?

00:38:38.796 --> 00:38:39.881
You asshole.

00:38:41.257 --> 00:38:43.843
You'll rot in prison, you son of a bitch.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:48.222
I told you there's only one way for you
to get out of this alive, didn't I?

00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:52.143
You don't know what you're talking about.

00:38:52.226 --> 00:38:53.937
If I betray Kitae…

00:38:56.105 --> 00:38:57.941
I'm dead for real.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.402
Yeah, that's why… Baek Kitae, damn it.

00:39:01.486 --> 00:39:04.238
That's why you should put him
behind bars with your own hands!

00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:06.115
Hey! Kang Daeil!

00:39:06.824 --> 00:39:09.786
Listen carefully
if you want your sentence reduced.

00:39:10.536 --> 00:39:13.164
Confess to everything.
Say Baek Kitae made you do it.

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:15.458
Got it? You understand?

00:39:18.544 --> 00:39:20.463
What the hell are you looking at?

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:33.851
This bastard.

00:39:37.647 --> 00:39:38.690
Let me see, damn it.

00:39:42.777 --> 00:39:46.447
You've been toying with meth,
and now you've turned into a damn junkie.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.370
How many times do I have to ask?

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.123
You've been keeping Baek Kitae's ledgers.

00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:56.416
Where are they?

00:39:56.499 --> 00:39:58.793
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:01.129
You know

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:05.133
my brother's a public official.

00:40:05.216 --> 00:40:06.217
Oh, yeah?

00:40:06.718 --> 00:40:08.261
Then what about the meth here?

00:40:08.344 --> 00:40:10.722
Are you saying you got this on your own?

00:40:12.724 --> 00:40:15.977
Are you seriously going to take
all the blame?

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.189
Why would you do that for a guy
who dragged his own sister into his mess

00:40:20.273 --> 00:40:21.858
and turned her into a criminal?

00:40:23.651 --> 00:40:25.486
Can I have a cigarette, please?

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:36.831
Thanks.

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:51.095
Sunyeong… Oh, right.

00:40:53.598 --> 00:40:54.640
Ms. Oh Yejin.

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:58.728
You told me you had older brothers.

00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:00.605
Was that true?

00:41:01.647 --> 00:41:03.149
I only have two younger siblings.

00:41:04.192 --> 00:41:05.359
Well then,

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.403
you should know.

00:41:10.073 --> 00:41:11.074
You see,

00:41:12.742 --> 00:41:14.368
I feel sorry for my big brother.

00:41:16.412 --> 00:41:18.414
Our parents died young,

00:41:19.207 --> 00:41:22.627
and he had to feed us, clothe us,
and put us through school.

00:41:25.338 --> 00:41:27.381
Do you have any idea how hard he worked?

00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:30.635
And now…

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:37.809
…you're telling me to sell him out
just to save myself?

00:41:39.685 --> 00:41:41.312
No, I'd rather die.

00:41:53.157 --> 00:41:54.367
How did it go?

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.244
Baek Soyeong didn't even bat an eye.

00:41:56.327 --> 00:41:59.413
She'd jump straight into hellfire
if he told her to.

00:41:59.497 --> 00:42:01.916
Well, good thing we got
at least one of them to talk.

00:42:02.875 --> 00:42:05.169
- What do you mean?
- Kang Daeil confessed.

00:42:06.295 --> 00:42:07.296
Are you serious?

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.756
Yeah.

00:42:11.008 --> 00:42:13.427
It was all…

00:42:16.305 --> 00:42:18.266
Kitae. He made me do it.

00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:23.104
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

00:42:26.399 --> 00:42:29.569
He said we should really expand
the meth business.

00:42:30.153 --> 00:42:31.696
The Ikeda clan…

00:42:34.699 --> 00:42:36.325
When Manjae was alive…

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.497
Soyeong doesn't know any of this.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.208
I just asked her

00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:48.045
to bring it to me, and she did.

00:42:48.129 --> 00:42:49.547
That's all, I swear.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.756
Mr. Jang.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.009
Soyeong really doesn't know
anything, okay?

00:42:53.092 --> 00:42:55.636
Promise me. She doesn't know anything.

00:42:56.345 --> 00:42:57.847
She has nothing to do with this!

00:42:58.347 --> 00:43:01.142
- Daeil. Daeil, I hear you.
- She doesn't know anything.

00:43:01.976 --> 00:43:03.644
I need you to promise me. Promise me.

00:43:03.728 --> 00:43:04.729
All right.

00:43:05.521 --> 00:43:07.481
I hear you, so calm down.

00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:11.319
You're doing great, okay? Just trust me.

00:43:13.279 --> 00:43:14.488
Okay.

00:43:14.572 --> 00:43:17.116
You're going to say the whole thing again

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.076
from start to finish.

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:21.412
Slowly and clearly.

00:43:22.246 --> 00:43:24.707
Ready, go.

00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:28.044
It was all…

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:34.091
Kitae. He made me do it.

00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:38.888
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

00:43:41.974 --> 00:43:45.144
He said we should really expand
the meth business.

00:43:49.523 --> 00:43:51.943
Who the hell are you? Gangsters?

00:43:52.026 --> 00:43:53.027
Excuse me.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.530
Esteemed KCIA agents,
the Busan District Prosecutors' Office

00:43:56.614 --> 00:43:59.700
requests your cooperation
in carrying out our official duties.

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:03.913
"Search and seizure warrant"?

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.878
Well, screw you.

00:44:10.962 --> 00:44:12.505
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

00:44:12.588 --> 00:44:14.590
Push through!

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:20.888
Go! Go! Go!

00:44:27.645 --> 00:44:29.230
Get in there! Go!

00:44:29.313 --> 00:44:31.357
Don't let them push you back! Go!

00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:33.526
Go!

00:44:39.865 --> 00:44:41.284
Open the door!

00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:54.922
You don't point a gun
at a fellow public servant!

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.555
Goddamn it!

00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:06.851
What the fuck's going on?

00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.227
Fucking hell!

00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:11.439
What a mess!

00:45:31.959 --> 00:45:33.169
Who are you?

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.881
Who are you?

00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:40.051
Mr. Baek Kitae!

00:45:49.727 --> 00:45:50.811
Come with us.

00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:54.023
What do you think you're doing?

00:45:54.106 --> 00:45:55.107
Serving the country.

00:45:56.901 --> 00:45:59.153
I'm serving the country too.

00:46:02.406 --> 00:46:04.867
ARREST WARRANT

00:46:06.452 --> 00:46:07.745
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

00:46:13.918 --> 00:46:14.919
All right, let's go.

00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:17.129
- Make way, please.
- Clear the way.

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:18.214
Come on.

00:46:19.048 --> 00:46:21.133
- Coming through.
- Step aside, please.

00:46:24.011 --> 00:46:26.806
My fellow citizens of Busan.

00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:32.895
Thanks to your support
in the 5th and 6th presidential elections,

00:46:33.979 --> 00:46:36.982
I was elected president twice.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.281
Chief,

00:46:44.782 --> 00:46:47.743
the prosecutors have arrested
Baek from the KCIA.

00:46:48.994 --> 00:46:52.248
I have always been grateful
for that support.

00:46:53.374 --> 00:46:54.834
We just got word.

00:46:54.917 --> 00:46:57.378
They've raided Chief Cheon's office too.

00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:01.382
Tell them to strike hard.
No hesitation, no half measures.

00:47:02.258 --> 00:47:04.051
This is our chance

00:47:05.136 --> 00:47:09.181
to wipe out all those KCIA men
in the Blue House.

00:47:11.434 --> 00:47:12.435
And I…

00:47:27.158 --> 00:47:28.451
Step outside for a minute.

00:47:28.534 --> 00:47:30.369
- Pardon?
- Go have a smoke.

00:47:45.134 --> 00:47:46.594
It was all…

00:47:50.431 --> 00:47:52.516
Kitae. He made me do it.

00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:57.271
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

00:47:59.148 --> 00:48:02.359
He said we should really expand
the meth business.

00:48:02.443 --> 00:48:04.445
There's this yakuza clan

00:48:05.571 --> 00:48:07.239
Manjae tried to deal with

00:48:08.073 --> 00:48:09.783
back when he was alive.

00:48:11.076 --> 00:48:12.328
Baek Kitae…

00:48:16.123 --> 00:48:18.042
and that woman named Ikeda Yuji…

00:48:20.878 --> 00:48:21.921
made a deal…

00:48:26.634 --> 00:48:29.803
Daeil seemed to care a lot
about Baek Soyeong.

00:48:31.096 --> 00:48:32.848
Turns out the bastard's a romantic.

00:48:33.724 --> 00:48:35.684
Thanks to that, everything went smoothly.

00:48:40.856 --> 00:48:42.775
All right, Mr. Kang Daeil.

00:48:44.193 --> 00:48:49.114
Write down everything
you've told us about Baek Kitae so far.

00:48:49.198 --> 00:48:50.824
Don't leave out a single thing.

00:48:59.625 --> 00:49:00.918
This is the meth

00:49:01.794 --> 00:49:03.546
Baek Soyeong was distributing.

00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:05.422
With Kang Daeil.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.675
It's a massive amount,

00:49:08.217 --> 00:49:09.677
and we caught it.

00:49:14.848 --> 00:49:16.892
Baek Soyeong and Kang Daeil

00:49:18.769 --> 00:49:20.145
were skimming off meth

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.815
behind your back.

00:49:25.985 --> 00:49:28.404
You get the picture now?

00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.115
If you lock me up,

00:49:32.866 --> 00:49:35.411
you think you're going
to move up in the world?

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.038
What are you doing this for?

00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:41.083
I want to get rid of people like you

00:49:42.209 --> 00:49:44.003
from this world.

00:49:44.837 --> 00:49:46.505
You want to change the world?

00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:49.341
That kind of thing?

00:49:49.842 --> 00:49:52.595
Even if I'm gone,
the world isn't going to change.

00:49:53.304 --> 00:49:55.055
Hmm…

00:49:58.517 --> 00:50:00.603
When you handed the money to Chief Cheon,

00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:03.522
you got that on tape, didn't you?

00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:11.196
That tape.

00:50:12.031 --> 00:50:13.324
Hand it over to me.

00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:15.909
Otherwise, you're going to prison.

00:50:15.993 --> 00:50:17.620
Both you

00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:19.705
and your sister.

00:50:27.046 --> 00:50:30.049
You think Cheon's
going to protect you? Hmm?

00:50:41.352 --> 00:50:44.521
I'll handle it and ensure it never causes
you any trouble, Mr. President.

00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:06.835
What happened?

00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:10.756
Baek Kitae's being questioned
at the prosecutors' office,

00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:12.716
but things are not looking good, sir.

00:51:15.719 --> 00:51:16.720
What about Pyo?

00:51:17.763 --> 00:51:18.889
I can't reach him.

00:51:22.518 --> 00:51:26.980
To him, you're just a tool
he can toss aside anytime he wants.

00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:32.027
You know that better than anyone.

00:51:38.075 --> 00:51:40.411
Where's the tape you recorded of him?

00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:44.331
If there was such a thing,
you'd already have it.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.000
You guys have already torn through

00:51:48.127 --> 00:51:50.170
my house and my office.

00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:57.720
Mr. Baek.

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:02.266
Do you trust Pyo Haksu?

00:52:11.483 --> 00:52:14.486
DEPARTMENT HEAD, BAEK KITAE

00:52:54.985 --> 00:52:56.904
CHEON SEOKJUNG

00:52:58.697 --> 00:53:00.157
Should be interesting.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.492
I wonder what'll happen

00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:04.828
if Cheon finds out you made

00:53:05.788 --> 00:53:07.289
a recording of him.

00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:12.503
Mr. Baek, you've come this far.

00:53:14.797 --> 00:53:15.964
Let's see it through.

00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:40.864
Have you heard of the Cu Chi tunnels?

00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:45.744
They're underground tunnels the Viet Cong
dug to take cover from US bombing.

00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:51.041
They're barely big enough
for one person to squeeze through.

00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:53.836
It was hard even to breathe in there.

00:53:54.503 --> 00:53:57.047
What are you talking about?

00:53:57.548 --> 00:53:59.925
Just let me finish my story.
It's not that long.

00:54:00.968 --> 00:54:02.886
I've never told this to anyone before.

00:54:04.221 --> 00:54:07.933
I'm sharing it only with you, Mr. Jang.

00:54:13.605 --> 00:54:17.484
My company was sent in with orders
to root out the Viet Cong hideouts.

00:54:19.152 --> 00:54:21.280
Those tunnels were like a maze.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.783
Hard to see ahead,

00:54:25.325 --> 00:54:27.452
never knowing where a bullet
might come from.

00:54:29.621 --> 00:54:34.501
Fear closes in, and the only thing
you can rely on is your comrades.

00:54:35.377 --> 00:54:38.589
All you can do is follow them forward.

00:54:56.231 --> 00:54:58.650
Commander,
we've got a radio message.

00:55:01.236 --> 00:55:02.321
What's the situation?

00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:04.281
It is a Viet Cong hideout, sir.

00:55:04.781 --> 00:55:06.825
Continue the search
and report back as you go.

00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:08.744
Colonel.

00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:10.037
Colonel!

00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:14.082
Sir, we've confirmed
it's a Viet Cong hideout.

00:55:14.166 --> 00:55:15.626
We should pull out.

00:55:18.545 --> 00:55:20.422
The guys wanted to pull out,

00:55:21.715 --> 00:55:23.508
but I couldn't do that.

00:55:24.343 --> 00:55:25.344
Why?

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.472
Because I was a soldier,

00:55:28.555 --> 00:55:29.848
and soldiers follow orders.

00:55:31.141 --> 00:55:34.645
I led my guys deeper

00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:37.689
into hell.

00:55:55.123 --> 00:55:56.249
Boom.

00:55:59.753 --> 00:56:00.796
Boom.

00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:04.925
Boom.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.721
Boom.

00:56:17.813 --> 00:56:19.356
It was US bombing.

00:56:20.482 --> 00:56:22.859
The moment they confirmed
it was a Viet Cong hideout,

00:56:22.943 --> 00:56:24.194
they started the bombing.

00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:28.990
Whether we lived or died
didn't matter to them.

00:56:31.493 --> 00:56:32.911
After all,

00:56:34.413 --> 00:56:37.332
I was just cannon fodder
for someone else's rise.

00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:40.961
By sheer luck,

00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:45.382
I barely made it out
of those tunnels alive.

00:56:47.259 --> 00:56:50.387
I went straight to the battalion commander
to punch him in the face.

00:56:52.264 --> 00:56:54.224
I really wanted to kill that bastard.

00:56:56.143 --> 00:56:57.352
But guess what?

00:56:57.436 --> 00:57:00.981
I took responsibility
for my men's deaths and stepped down,

00:57:02.649 --> 00:57:04.860
while that bastard jumped two ranks

00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:06.194
and pinned on a star.

00:57:08.864 --> 00:57:11.533
Whether you buy it or take it at gunpoint,

00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:14.327
I believe

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.581
it's those with power
who change the world in the end.

00:57:18.707 --> 00:57:21.001
You can keep shouting about justice.

00:57:21.752 --> 00:57:23.044
But without power,

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.423
you're just treated like cattle.

00:57:32.387 --> 00:57:35.766
WRITTEN STATEMENT

00:57:48.278 --> 00:57:49.362
So what?

00:57:49.905 --> 00:57:52.282
The world's gone mad…

00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:56.745
so you're just going to sell meth
and make money?

00:58:02.626 --> 00:58:04.169
Don't be ridiculous, asshole.

00:58:04.669 --> 00:58:06.671
Your pathetic excuse disgusts me.

00:58:08.965 --> 00:58:13.762
Everyone makes their own choices in life.

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:17.224
And you chose

00:58:18.266 --> 00:58:19.559
to be a drug dealer

00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:21.937
and a killer.

00:58:26.274 --> 00:58:28.777
You know the biggest difference
between you and me?

00:58:30.862 --> 00:58:34.616
I have the power
to take responsibility for my choices.

00:59:04.062 --> 00:59:06.106
Also, I think you're mistaken.

00:59:07.649 --> 00:59:11.528
Chief Cheon won't really care
whether that tape exists or not.

00:59:12.237 --> 00:59:15.073
All that matters to him is
whether something benefits him or not.

00:59:16.491 --> 00:59:18.034
Because he has power.

00:59:20.996 --> 00:59:22.789
Drag it out all you want,

00:59:24.416 --> 00:59:25.542
but that tape

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:28.628
will end up in my hands.

00:59:28.712 --> 00:59:31.006
I guess you still have faith in people.

00:59:34.342 --> 00:59:35.343
Pyo Haksu.

00:59:37.137 --> 00:59:38.138
Do you trust him?

00:59:47.147 --> 00:59:48.565
Let's drink, shall we?

00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:51.067
Wow, congratulations.

00:59:58.783 --> 00:59:59.784
Chief.

01:00:01.536 --> 01:00:03.288
This election is an important one.

01:00:28.271 --> 01:00:30.315
You should
listen to it yourself, sir.

01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.324
CHEON SEOKJUNG

01:00:56.424 --> 01:00:58.510
Look, I'm genuinely curious.

01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:01.972
Why do you work so hard?

01:01:03.431 --> 01:01:06.142
Is it because of your father?

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.645
I heard he was a junkie.

01:01:08.728 --> 01:01:10.313
He even killed your mom.

01:01:21.616 --> 01:01:23.451
You'll never win against me.

01:01:23.535 --> 01:01:24.577
Why, you ask?

01:01:24.661 --> 01:01:28.748
Because you're one of those foolish cattle
who think they can change the world!

01:02:04.492 --> 01:02:06.995
I've received your gesture of goodwill.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:08.496
Quite a sum, I must say.

01:02:09.414 --> 01:02:13.126
No one appreciates my efforts
like you do, Chairman Park.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.172
And please tell
Chairman Kim of Taejong Group

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.632
that he has nothing to worry about.

01:02:21.593 --> 01:02:24.637
How dare you bug me?

01:02:25.388 --> 01:02:27.182
What the hell are you trying to pull?

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:29.267
Chairman Park of Seongwan Constructions,

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.560
Chairman Kim of Taejong Group.

01:02:31.853 --> 01:02:35.940
The President was paying extra attention
to them ahead of the election, no?

01:02:36.024 --> 01:02:38.068
You've got guts, I'll give you that.

01:02:38.151 --> 01:02:40.653
You think
he'll believe anything you say?

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:43.490
You're already finished.

01:02:47.118 --> 01:02:48.703
The raid today

01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.291
was all signed off
by the President himself, too.

01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:05.011
Chief Na, you still don't know
the man, do you?

01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:11.142
The President doesn't have much affection
for his dogs like you or me.

01:03:12.477 --> 01:03:14.813
As long as you don't touch his food,

01:03:15.438 --> 01:03:17.941
it doesn't matter
if you're a shepherd or a mutt.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:22.278
Just wag your tail and you're fine.

01:03:23.655 --> 01:03:24.656
But…

01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:31.121
You, Chief Na?

01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:36.960
You went and laid your hands
right on his food.

01:03:40.046 --> 01:03:42.841
I wonder how many more tapes like that
are sitting in the KCIA.

01:03:42.924 --> 01:03:44.342
You son of a bitch!

01:03:49.264 --> 01:03:50.265
Hey, man.

01:03:50.849 --> 01:03:52.267
You're fucked.

01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:06.364
Damn it.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.742
You bastard!

01:04:33.141 --> 01:04:34.809
Did you think I wouldn't know

01:04:35.935 --> 01:04:37.353
what you'd try to pull

01:04:38.855 --> 01:04:40.356
while I was gone?

01:04:42.859 --> 01:04:46.070
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung met
with Chief of Staff Na Yongcheol.

01:04:46.905 --> 01:04:48.781
He also met with Pyo Haksu.

01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:53.620
Looks like Pyo has switched over to Jang.

01:04:53.703 --> 01:04:54.704
And now,

01:04:55.496 --> 01:04:57.373
Jang's looking for Kang Daeil.

01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:02.795
That little shit.

01:05:04.088 --> 01:05:05.924
You get the picture now?

01:05:08.885 --> 01:05:09.886
What the…

01:05:10.678 --> 01:05:11.846
Hey, call an ambulance!

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.015
Hey, come on! Call an ambulance!

01:05:14.098 --> 01:05:16.726
- Somebody, call an ambulance! Now!
- Ambulance!

01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:22.148
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:36.120
Damn it!

01:05:59.769 --> 01:06:01.896
I'm going to survive on my own,

01:06:02.939 --> 01:06:05.358
not get used and tossed out like you.

01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:21.082
Baek Kitae.

01:06:21.582 --> 01:06:22.917
Baek Kitae, come here.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:25.753
Come here, you bastard.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.632
Who the hell are you? Huh?

01:06:35.013 --> 01:06:36.014
Baek Kitae!

01:06:37.724 --> 01:06:39.058
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung.

01:06:40.018 --> 01:06:41.519
You're under arrest

01:06:42.562 --> 01:06:43.896
for bribery.

01:06:44.814 --> 01:06:45.898
What?

01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:47.066
Goodness…

01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:54.490
Hey!

01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:22.226
When did you find out

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:24.395
I'd switched over to Jang Geonyoung?

01:07:26.064 --> 01:07:28.274
If Cheon Seokjung finds out

01:07:28.358 --> 01:07:30.777
you switched over to him,
what do you think he'll say?

01:07:31.861 --> 01:07:33.196
Is that a threat or what?

01:07:37.909 --> 01:07:39.285
You sly bastard.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.539
You used me as bait
to bring Jang Geonyoung down?

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:48.586
Hey, Pyo.

01:07:50.088 --> 01:07:51.422
Get your act together now.

01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:55.259
Stop going back and forth between sides.

01:07:57.136 --> 01:07:59.722
You're confusing people. All right?

01:08:06.562 --> 01:08:11.442
PROSECUTION SERVICE

01:08:12.652 --> 01:08:13.653
That's right.

01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:17.281
In the end, this is what Baek Kitae chose.

01:08:21.244 --> 01:08:23.204
But those who pull the trigger

01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:26.833
are never willing to bear
the weight of that one shot.

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:30.586
After arresting a large-scale
methamphetamine manufacturing ring

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:32.380
and investigating their connections,

01:08:32.463 --> 01:08:35.466
prosecutors in Busan found evidence
suggesting the group had been

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.302
under the protection
of a prosecutor in the Narcotics Unit.

01:08:38.386 --> 01:08:41.431
Authorities launched a full investigation
into those implicated.

01:08:41.514 --> 01:08:43.558
The ringleader, identified as Kang,

01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:46.477
who had been producing meth illegally
and trafficking it to Japan,

01:08:46.561 --> 01:08:50.022
reportedly took his own life
during a lapse in monitoring,

01:08:50.106 --> 01:08:52.608
amidst his questioning last night.

01:08:52.692 --> 01:08:55.319
In a note left behind,

01:08:55.403 --> 01:08:58.406
Kang alleged that
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung…

01:08:58.489 --> 01:09:00.199
The dead stay silent,

01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:03.536
and what follows falls to the living.

01:09:16.507 --> 01:09:17.675
Hello, Chief Na.

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:21.179
Get rid of Jang.

01:09:21.262 --> 01:09:23.055
If the blade's broken, you throw it out.

01:09:23.723 --> 01:09:25.016
Yes, sir. Understood.

01:09:46.871 --> 01:09:48.539
PROSECUTOR JANG GEONYOUNG

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:58.466
Where's Jang Hyeeun?

01:10:12.188 --> 01:10:13.356
Where's Jang Hyeeun?

01:10:13.439 --> 01:10:15.149
Shut up and put your head on the ground!

01:10:16.442 --> 01:10:18.444
JANG MYEONGHO

01:10:35.837 --> 01:10:37.839
INTERROGATION ROOM 1

01:10:59.402 --> 01:11:01.404
Here he comes!

01:11:02.071 --> 01:11:04.365
Mr. Jang,
are you being taken into custody?

01:11:04.448 --> 01:11:06.784
Since when have you
been colluding with the drug ring?

01:11:08.244 --> 01:11:09.912
To those in power,

01:11:10.454 --> 01:11:12.456
the people are still nothing but cattle,

01:11:13.583 --> 01:11:16.294
and I, who lived differently
from them, am gone.

01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:21.048
I wonder.

01:11:22.675 --> 01:11:24.385
What was my patriotism truly for?

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.408
We closed Director Hwang's murder case

01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:49.952
with Kang Daeil
as the sole culprit as well.

01:11:53.247 --> 01:11:54.916
You're a lucky man, Baek.

01:11:56.292 --> 01:12:00.546
The guy who worked for you
took all the blame with him to the grave.

01:12:04.091 --> 01:12:07.011
Sniffing out money isn't your only skill.
You can use your head too.

01:12:08.179 --> 01:12:10.932
It was all thanks to your help, sir.

01:12:16.062 --> 01:12:17.480
You got one on me too?

01:12:20.983 --> 01:12:22.068
The tape.

01:12:23.527 --> 01:12:25.071
No, of course not.

01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:28.074
How could you even say that?

01:12:35.206 --> 01:12:36.290
Baek.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:41.712
We're really in the same boat now.

01:12:44.924 --> 01:12:46.092
Let's do this right.

01:13:21.127 --> 01:13:22.253
We're all set.

01:13:27.049 --> 01:13:28.134
All right, go ahead!

01:13:37.184 --> 01:13:38.269
Good work, guys.

01:14:06.672 --> 01:14:07.840
Cheers.

01:14:09.008 --> 01:14:11.052
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

01:15:18.828 --> 01:15:21.038
DIRECTOR GENERAL BAEK KITAE

01:15:43.561 --> 01:15:44.937
I pledge…

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.272
I pledge…

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:49.275
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

01:15:49.358 --> 01:15:51.610
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.321
…to devote…

01:15:54.405 --> 01:15:56.157
…to devote…

01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.618
…my loyalty to the President…

01:15:59.702 --> 01:16:02.371
…my loyalty to the President…

01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:08.836
…and the everlasting glory…

01:16:09.795 --> 01:16:11.839
…and the everlasting glory…

01:16:12.756 --> 01:16:14.508
…of our homeland.

01:16:14.592 --> 01:16:16.635
…of our homeland!

01:21:11.847 --> 01:21:13.849
