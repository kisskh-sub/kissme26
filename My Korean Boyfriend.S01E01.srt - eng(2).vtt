00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.513
Good evening, Seoul!

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.683
The temperature is
17 degrees with clear skies.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.934
Enjoy the day.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.983
- Oh, how pretty!
- That one!

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:27.986
Wow!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.363
Are you ready to make your wishes?

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.032
- I am!
- I'm so ready!

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.621
{\an8}I want a second date
as special as the first one.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.460
{\an8}His mother needs to know
I have a daughter.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.796
{\an8}Should I really have returned to Korea?

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.092
{\an8}I really wanna leave here married.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.220
{\an8}Does that guy even exist?

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.390
{\an8}I don't want to go through
the same thing again.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.563
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.154
{\an8}THE DAY BEFORE

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.089
So, babe? Did you talk to him?

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:30.381
It's ringing.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.927
- Do you think he'll come?
- I don't know.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.930
- Come with us by train then.
- Yeah.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.309
Let's go back inside.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.688
This is Mari.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.400
This is after talking to this guy
on the internet for a year,

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.445
30 hours of flight and
a lot of expectations.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.613
He didn't show up.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.995
Well, let's be honest,
this happens even in the best K-dramas.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.290
But the difference is that
this is real life, you know?

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.301
Oh, we're here!

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.304
- It's our time, let's celebrate now
- Girls, look at the tower!

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.597
There!

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.058
Let's celebrate now

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:27.730
I want to live here!

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.317
{\an8}All night, all night
With my best friends, party, fiesta

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.571
It's our time
Let's celebrate now

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.576
We are five Brazilian women
with five love stories in Korea.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.329
We have a month in Seoul
to solve our issues of the heart.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:47.333
And also have fun, right?
'Cause you can't live on drama alone.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:48.793
Ahh!

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.545
Girl, hold on, hold on! Your shoes.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:51.588
Take off your shoes.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.464
- Let's take them off.
- That's wild.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:54.465
We have to.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.800
- It's the culture.
- Yeah.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.179
We're going to stay in this
perfect place for a month.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:01.097
I could definitely live here.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.307
Would you guys?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.225
- Sit here.
- That's the million-dollar question.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.686
- We have to gossip.
- Will we experience a K-drama?

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.731
Girl, I'm already living a K-drama, okay?

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.028
My name is Katy, and I swear on my cats
that I'm living a real K-drama.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:21.201
I… The-the-the last time I came here,
I went to Busan, right?

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:24.370
On the way back,
on the train, I went to the bathroom.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.039
When I came out of the bathroom,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:30.627
there was this guy there all dressed
in army green in a military uniform.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.420
Huge, like this.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:33.671
- Waiting for me.
- No way!

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.090
- That only happens in K-dramas.
- Yup.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.508
Waiting for me outside.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:41.012
And then he started talking to me,
we exchanged numbers.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:44.224
- And we're still talking to this day.
- So it's already real life.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.559
- And when was that?
- Since 2023.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.520
- Aren't you going to meet?
- We are, obviously.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.314
- Anytime now.
- Yeah!

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.527
I'm gonna go live in the train, you guys.
I'll stay on 24 hours a day,

00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.281
sitting, waiting all week for someone
to bring me a bouquet of flowers.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.616
Can I say what I'm iffy about?

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.034
Of course.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:07.247
I'm afraid that I'm either going
to love him even more than I do now,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.624
or I'm going to fall out of love.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.251
With your current boyfriend?

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.169
- Why?
- I don't know.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.420
I'm scared.

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.509
And this is Luanny.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:23.304
She fell in love with
the most complicated guy in Korea.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.515
They met through an app.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.517
Well, I think
she should tell this story herself.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.102
Where did you meet him?

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.478
- On an app.
- There?

00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:31.771
- Yup.
- So you…

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.066
As soon as we started talking,
he said I was the ideal girl for him,

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.193
because our personalities were the same.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.445
But I made it very clear
that I have a daughter.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.656
So if you're not okay with that,
go on with your life.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.157
I'll go on with mine, and that's it.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.993
When he asked to call me to see her,

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.578
he said he felt
as if she were his daughter.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.789
- Those things got to me.
- Think he's being honest?

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.166
- I think that's a lie. No?
- No, I don't think so.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.963
Those things moved me.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.172
And then,

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:01.801
like, he started saying,
"I'll send you the money I make,

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.594
and you'll manage it."

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.014
And then I waited
for him to come to Brazil.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.390
December comes, and he's like,

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.810
"I'm not going to be able to come.
I don't have the money."

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.981
"Borrow money from your friends
and pay for the ticket here,

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.859
and I'll pay you back on December 25th."

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.861
So I borrowed money from my friends

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.238
- so I could travel. I swear.
- You're kidding me!

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.115
- Girl, that's crazy!
- It was totally crazy.

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:26.993
And how long had you guys been… talking?

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.455
Umm… I think a…
a month and a half, two months.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.332
That was our biggest source of stress.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.917
He would tell me one thing,
and when the day came,

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.920
he would change everything.
He would change the entire plan I made.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.215
- But how many times has he done that?
- Oh, many times.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.969
The thing is, I love him.
I love him so much.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.513
But I'm afraid he'll mess me up…

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.723
- Yeah.
- He already has.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.559
You're already in debt
because of this relationship.

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:54.395
It's up to you, girl,
but let me give you some honest advice.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.563
Yes, please tell her.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.065
I would get out.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.706
Look what happened to Luanny.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.667
Danny might be one of those.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:20.630
I don't wanna look like a fool, but damn,
I came from the other side of the planet,

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.423
and then he disappeared.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.604
I'm not available at the moment.

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:39.482
Please leave a message with your name
and number, and I'll call you back.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:46.781
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:48.241
I wonder where we're going today.

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:53.287
I think, like, when we… Because we left
the airport and came straight home,

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.748
I think that, you know,

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.167
at night, if we decide to do something…

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.252
…we…

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.673
We'll get to know the city better.
We'll see, like…

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.883
Yeah, then we can see
if we'll want to go out.

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:09.846
The boy is texting me.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.681
- Your man? No way!
- Yeah. My guy.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.765
- I swear!
- What'd he say?

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.058
Um, he said,

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.936
''Hello, Katy, this is Jack,
how are you doing?" Uh…

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.189
"Let's meet today. I'll pick you up,
if you're fine with that."

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.400
I'm shook!

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:23.401
Like a date?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.695
{\an8}Mm-hmm. Probably.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.988
{\an8}Hey!

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:30.783
Say hi, "Hi! How are you? I miss you!"

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:31.868
{\an8}I'm already here!

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:40.376
Jack is on his way to pick me up,
but what did you want to talk about?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.128
That stuff, you know…

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.006
That makes me a little upset.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.883
- Oh, let's talk about it. Yeah.
- I'm not comf…

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.343
And also see
what the future holds for us, right?

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:52.680
Because we made so many plans,
but never made any of them happen.

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.849
So you guys really have to talk

00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:57.310
and see if that's what
you guys really want.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.769
And what about yours?

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:00.897
He's so nice, girl. He's a sweetheart.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.399
I don't understand
how you haven't kissed him yet.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.319
This is not Brazil, is it?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.864
Are you going to, if you have the chance?

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:13.618
No, I'm gonna wait to do that.
You have to get to know the person.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:16.329
I'm not like that,
I don't kiss the night away.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:17.663
Will the chemistry be there?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.873
I hope so.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.625
Will it? Will it?

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.335
- You'll tell me everything?
- Everything.

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:24.128
- And you will too, okay?
- I will.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.756
- I hope we don't go back on bad terms.
- What's going on?

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:30.009
- Look at her!
- Wow! Gorgeous!

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.385
Well, thank you very much!

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.888
Oh, my God!

00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.264
Whoa!

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.558
No way! No way!

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.477
It's Jack. Jack is here.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.521
Help!

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.524
Come!

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.108
Let's gossip.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.944
Run, girl!

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:50.488
You can't see anything,
not even at the door.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:53.824
- You can't see anything.
- Where is she?

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.288
Girls, she's on her way.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.960
Oh, I'm so nervous.
I'm so nervous for her.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.175
Wow, I'd have run away already.

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:20.768
- I'm shocked!
- Wow, what a hottie!

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.689
Look how tall he is!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.274
Damn, he's hot.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.071
How are you?

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.990
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.158
- How are you? Yeah.
- Give me a hug.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.578
Damn, you guys,
is he wearing a suit? Is he?

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:40.496
I want to see her face.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.873
She has good taste in men, huh?

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:45.501
White shirt, he's fancy, huh?
He's dressed up.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.919
He's wearing a suit.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:48.045
No way!

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.547
- No way!
- He's fancy.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.299
- A suit?
- Yeah, he's at the door.

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.891
I'm shook, I can't believe it.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.935
- He's hot. Oh my God!
- Will they leave holding hands?

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:05.187
- Wow.
- Let's watch them leave.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.274
- No, I think it's too soon.
- No.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:09.817
So what if it's too soon?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.943
To hold hands?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.654
- They'll hold hands on the first date.
- What do you mean?

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:14.655
Holding hands?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.615
- Yeah.
- You can't.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:16.866
- Why not?
- No, not yet.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.410
- It's too soon.
- I do. I get excited right away.

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.180
This is so beautiful.

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:40.890
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.476
- I'm glad to be here, actually.
- Yeah?

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.811
Yeah, to, like, get to know you better.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.938
- Mm-hmm.
- Spend some time together.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:48.856
Yeah, me too.

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:51.525
- Yeah, see the cherry blossoms.
- Right.

00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:55.780
Cherry blossom is basically,
um, for only one week.

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.074
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, basically, in Korea.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:02.244
- So I'm, like, the luckiest person ever?
- Yeah, you're kind of lucky.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.329
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:06.290
Is there cherry blossom even in Brazil?
No.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.833
- No? Really?
- No, not really.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:08.918
- No.
- Oh.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.629
And this is, like,
one of my favorite flowers ever.

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:12.630
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.757
So is that your first time, or…

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.300
It's my first time seeing it.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.469
- Really?
- Yes, yeah. So I'm really excited.

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:20.971
- Like, very emotional about it, you know.
- Really?

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:24.767
- It's actually, um…
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.895
…been quite a long time
not to see each other, right?

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:30.731
- Yeah, I think more than a year.
- Also not to talk to each other.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.566
- Maybe, yeah. Probably.
- Yeah.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.735
And then I've been super busy…

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.612
- Mm-hmm.
- …you've been in the military.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.030
- That's right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:40.866
This looks so beautiful.

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:42.493
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:44.870
Like a painting and everything,
all the colors.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.080
Mm-hmm.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.920
- Okay. So…
- Yeah.

00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.047
What do you want to talk about?

00:11:55.631 --> 00:12:01.721
So, uh, like, you know, uh, we, like,
never seen each other for a year, right?

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:03.931
- Yeah. We haven't seen each other…
- Yeah.

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:05.725
…for a year since we met on the train.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.352
- So how was your first impression of me?
- Mm…

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.020
You're really nice.

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.316
Yeah, and at the time,
you were really, um, attractive.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.609
Mm-hmm.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.115
Is there any, like, change for you?

00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:22.533
Well, I got promoted.

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:23.993
- Oh really? Congratulations.
- Yes.

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.286
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:26.412
To me, also, like,

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.290
um, I just discharged
from military service, right?

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.041
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, so, um,

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.128
sometimes, you know,
the person who just discharged

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.922
is like, you know,
"I don't know where I have to go."

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.549
- Oh yeah.
- Like that. Yeah, but, um…

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:41.761
This is also really good timing
to get to know each other.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:44.805
Yeah, exactly. And, like, it's beautiful.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.641
- Right, yeah.
- I feel like it's the perfect timing.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.770
I really, basically,
like nature things, so…

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:51.854
Yeah.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:54.648
What about Korean food? Did you have one?

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.859
Yeah, I had… The other day, I had it.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.861
- Like, spicy one, or…
- Yeah.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.613
- Of course. I love spicy food.
- You like it?

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:01.864
I do love it, yes.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.532
We have to eat something spicy.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.284
- Absolutely, yeah. Absolutely.
- Yes.

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.037
- I'm not actually--
- I'm here to do stuff with you.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.163
- Come on.
- Right, yeah.

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:11.499
Actually, I'm not really good
at spicy things.

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:12.958
- No?
- Yeah.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.877
- But, um…
- You're a fake Korean.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.088
- But, um, yeah. I will… I will try.
- Yes.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.966
Do you have any, like, allergy, or stuff?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.636
- No. Not at all. Yeah.
- Not at all? Okay.

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.179
So it's good. I can eat everything.

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:26.680
Yeah, good. Yeah.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.557
I don't have allergy too.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.434
No, okay, so that's a good thing.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.560
Except cat.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.772
- What?
- Cat, cat. I have cat allergy.

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:36.524
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.359
- Shut up, get out of here.
- Why?

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:41.070
- You're a cat person?
- Yes, I have cats.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.446
- You have cats?
- I have four cats.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.364
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:44.532
Oh.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:51.038
I… I'm kind of like dog person,
more than cat. Yeah.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:52.164
- Yeah.
- So…

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:57.044
How could he not like cats?
So cute and so mistaken.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.755
But let's keep going,
we'll find something in common.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.008
- So, yeah… What else?
- Yeah, we talked a lot though.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.011
We do. I… You keep telling,
"You talk a lot."

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:08.013
But this time, I'm letting you talk more.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:08.931
- Really?
- Yes.

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:11.100
Speaking of, you know, health, you know,

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.186
I'm really, you know,
recently care about health more.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.563
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.899
- You know, like, our age, right?
- You eat well, yeah, you…

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.609
You exercise a lot.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.945
You also care about that? Health?

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.697
- Well, that depends.
- It depends?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.408
Yeah. Like, I'm a party girl.

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:28.826
- Yeah, yeah.
- So I like going out

00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.202
- and drinking.
- Yeah.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:36.000
You know, I'm not, uh, the person who
really, like, into hang out, basically.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:37.001
Mm-hmm.

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:41.130
- You know, I'm quite a boring guy.
- Ah.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:46.051
We will find something in common.
I'm sure we'll find something.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.263
Do we have anything in common?

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.854
There are K-dramas that are
marked by misunderstandings,

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:59.398
which are meant to test
whether opposites really do attract.

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:04.486
And there are stories
that are all about the plot twist.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:13.787
In Korea, you don't marry
a woman who already has a child.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.498
So we need to talk about that.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:20.586
But how? My English isn't great,
and his is worse than mine.

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:21.879
What do I do?

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:32.765
Luanny!

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.309
Luanny!

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.818
Wait, why are you crying?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.113
Mm…

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.037
Hey, anyway…

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:58.499
I will give you something for you.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.712
Are you ready for it?

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.672
There!

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.549
For you!

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.302
Are you happy?

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:14.765
Happy, happy, happy!

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.368
Are you cold?

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:41.917
- My jacket.
- Thank you!

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.844
I'm really happy.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.804
Because I see you again.

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.246
- You comfortable?
- Mm.

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.251
Beautiful.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.343
Mm-hmm…

00:17:35.637 --> 00:17:38.140
I have something for you.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.740
What is this?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.244
What is it?

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:08.670
What is it?

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:11.673
You can try it.

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:16.178
We can speak…

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.181
language…

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.143
- Each other, understand it.
- Are you stupid?

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:31.860
From now on, we will be able
to talk to one another.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:33.987
I did this for you.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.907
Are you crazy?

00:18:39.993 --> 00:18:43.163
Now we can talk to each other.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:46.625
There is something else,
another surprise for you.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:50.879
Do you want to know what it is, Luanny?

00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.549
You have another surprise?

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:55.634
What is it?

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.972
Can you grab that paper
that's in my pocket?

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:01.974
In that pocket.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.729
Before you came to Korea,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.401
I tried practicing a bit,
but Portuguese is very hard.

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:16.488
But that wasn't going to stop me
from singing to you.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:23.120
One, two, three, four!

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:30.919
This ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum inside me

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.672
It goes ba-dum, ba-dum, when--

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.592
I don't… I don't remember the melody.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:38.886
Can you help me out?

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:44.266
- This ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum
- Inside me

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:49.188
That goes ba-dum, ba-dum
When you walk by me

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:54.151
My eyes memorize every move

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:58.697
Even your smile makes me shy

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.991
If I could hold you tight

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:03.577
Dominate your feelings

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.874
Control your steps
Read your agenda and thoughts

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:13.670
But my fragile heart beats faster

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:18.759
And goes ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.929
That was so good!

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:25.224
I actually practiced for three days.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.727
Three days? That was really good.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.728
I promise to…

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.525
keep practicing until I can sing it right.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:38.445
Where's the ring?

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:50.290
I look forward to the day when

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:52.834
I'll put a ring around your finger.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.380
Know that it might be soon, right?

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:00.133
Let's plan our future together.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.219
Let's move forward.

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.889
Always together.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.102
I love you, Luanny.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:12.521
I love you too. Very much.

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:15.065
Very much.

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:19.945
Are you scared of something?

00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.840
- So…
- Yeah.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:41.717
Do you work out though?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.094
Yes, but I'm not really
working out right now.

00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:47.973
But as soon as I go back to Brazil,
I'm gonna start Pilates.

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:50.267
Maybe start doing Muay Thai again.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.102
- Oh really? Oh, right.
- Yeah.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.229
I like it. I like fighting.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.440
- You know, when I was younger, um…
- Mm.

00:21:56.523 --> 00:22:00.027
I was really into, like,
um, mixed martial arts, right?

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.487
- You know, in Brazil--
- Jiu-jitsu?

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.906
- Like, Jiu-jitsu or, like, you know…
- Mm-hmm.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.491
Uh… Like…

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.535
- Even MMA, you know?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:12.205
- And UFC is really big in Brazil, right?
- Yeah. It's huge.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:13.123
Even now.

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:14.875
- Even now. Yeah.
- So, uh…

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.377
Do you know Anderson Silva?

00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:19.629
- Yes. He's really famous.
- Really? You know him?

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.132
- Everybody knows Anderson Silva.
- Really? Yeah.

00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:24.343
I respect him, I think he's a king,

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:27.179
but that can't be the only thing
that connects us, right?

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:30.432
Okay, so you came here
all the way from Ulsan?

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.726
- Right.
- And are you… going…

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:33.935
I should go back soon.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.896
- Okay, so maybe we should go, right?
- All right.

00:22:35.979 --> 00:22:37.147
- Yeah.
- It's getting colder.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.608
Yes, it's getting way too cold in here!

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:44.571
Well, now I'm already here.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:48.241
I crossed the world
to see where this story goes.

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:51.328
If it's going to go anywhere at all.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.248
Will we go out again after this?

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:07.594
Well, your family doesn't know

00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:09.513
that I have a daughter.

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:15.018
And I think we've reached the point
where we have to talk about it.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.815
We can't hide it anymore, right?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.151
Yes, of course. I know.

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.445
The first step is…

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:31.701
First we need
to meet my parents, you know.

00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:33.954
And once that happens,

00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:37.666
we won't need to hide Ayla from them.

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.668
Not anymore.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.215
It won't be long

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:50.220
until the day… we can be together.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.140
Nothing will stop me.

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:59.604
I think we made plans… in our minds, but

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:04.151
we didn't…
do anything to make them happen.

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:08.280
We just made promises and promises.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.700
But nothing changed.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:17.289
And sometimes I just feel like
we're just moving backwards,

00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:21.001
because we just promise
and don't do anything.

00:24:21.084 --> 00:24:24.463
And I don't want to spend so much
time living away from each other,

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.673
because it's hard for me too.

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:37.058
I will try harder to…

00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:41.771
To make our dreams come true.

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.316
Don't worry.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.194
But I'm scared.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.739
Scared of what?

00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:53.700
The fact…

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:57.913
that you spend money.

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.331
That's what I'm scared of.

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.000
That it hasn't stopped.

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:03.543
Oh, okay.

00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:06.296
I'm well aware.

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:08.632
Mm…

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:11.510
- But I swear--
- Do you swear to God you stopped?

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:13.470
Mm…

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:17.849
Swear.

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:20.810
Huh.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.438
I see. So, I quit, okay?

00:25:24.147 --> 00:25:25.774
- Starting now.
- Now?

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:27.359
I mean it.

00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:28.610
Just now?

00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:31.530
From now on.

00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:33.949
No.

00:25:34.574 --> 00:25:35.450
What?

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:39.579
You told me you were going to stop before,
and you're still doing it?

00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:44.709
Why are you shaking?

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.921
I'll be honest, I won't lie.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:51.299
I kept doing it, yeah.

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.009
But I was…

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.972
trying to keep it under control.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:58.557
And…

00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:04.020
If I really care about our future,
I should call it quits.

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:06.356
So…

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:11.528
From now on, I promise I will always
follow your advice. I mean that.

00:26:12.195 --> 00:26:14.364
Do you trust me?

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:16.116
No.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.996
What can I do to make you trust me?

00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:25.625
I'll go talk to your mom.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.673
My mother? You'll talk to her?

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:37.596
Because if I don't talk to your family,
you'll never change.

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:38.680
Never.

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:40.849
And I don't wanna drown.

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.644
How many times will you say
you'll change and then don't?

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:47.689
You're 35 years old.

00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:55.697
Sorry.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:01.244
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.582
Continuing where we left off,

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:09.461
I've told you this many times. Hm?

00:27:09.544 --> 00:27:10.545
Mm.

00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:14.090
That if we stay together,

00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:17.385
I am not going to…

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.054
- Hm?
- Mm.

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.722
…hide anything from you.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:24.434
Not my monthly salary,

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:28.021
uh, not my cell phone.

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:33.109
I won't hide anything.
There won't be any secrets.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.904
You'll have access to everything.

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:40.116
You'll be the one
in charge of our finances.

00:27:42.452 --> 00:27:44.454
Last time, you said the same thing.

00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:48.458
But we're not married yet.

00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:51.336
Is that necessary?

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.131
Aren't you thinking about the future?

00:27:56.007 --> 00:28:00.553
So you really need to get married and
join the church to start living your life?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.598
Those are just empty words.

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.602
Wait, you don't want to marry me?

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:12.565
You think I don't want to?

00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:15.735
That's not it.

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:20.156
You think I just came
all the way from Brazil,

00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.451
and I don't want to marry you?

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:36.297
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:39.759
He says he wants to marry me,
and I want to marry him,

00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:42.679
but everything he says
is the opposite of what he does.

00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:45.640
How am I going to build a life
with someone I don't trust?

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.965
You wear it better than I do, babe!

00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:21.217
The necklace looks great on her!

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:22.427
I want every detail.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.304
- What's up, girlfriend?
- Don't keep secrets.

00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:26.222
I came here to tie up some loose ends,

00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:30.769
and so I could say everything
that's been on my mind for a long time.

00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:35.982
And I brought something up that
he's sensitive about, which is money.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.987
He makes a lot of bad investments,
and that makes things very hard on us.

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:45.992
Because he's a person with
an extremely good heart.

00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:48.953
He has so many more positive things
to him than negative ones,

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.914
but he's starting to lose himself.

00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.458
Girl, speaking for myself,

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:56.294
I know your story, I know you've
been through a lot of hardships,

00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:59.130
your life hasn't been easy,
no one's life here is easy,

00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:02.592
everyone has problems. That whole
fairy tale fantasy doesn't exist.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:07.347
But given everything you've been through,
I don't want you to…

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.015
- Get hurt, you know?
- …get hurt.

00:30:09.098 --> 00:30:12.811
Yeah, but I hurt
just by seeing him in this situation.

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:16.189
Because I don't want him to, like,
hit rock bottom, you know?

00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:19.609
There's a saying that
I think suits you guys, it says,

00:30:19.692 --> 00:30:24.280
"I'm not perfect, but flowers may grow
even between the cracks and the stones."

00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:28.576
- So, don't be sad. There's hope, okay?
- There's hope. Yeah.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.245
And we can see that you're trying.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.162
- You know?
- Yeah.

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:35.542
You talk about him so kindly,
you want to help him.

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:39.254
But, like, there are things
that sometimes are harmful to us.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:43.341
When we try hard to hold onto something,
sometimes we don't need to hold on.

00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:46.427
- We have to release. You have to let go.
- Yeah.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.348
Girl, you're young,
you're beautiful, you're a fighter.

00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:53.518
You have a huge future ahead of you.

00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:57.105
There are things we can avoid, you know?

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:59.399
You don't have to go through this.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.030
Sometimes the writer of our lives
goes heavy on the drama.

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:11.244
Let's wake up, princess!

00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:12.745
Good morning, girls!

00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:16.082
- Time to wake up, princess!
- Aren't you going to wake up?

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:18.668
- Hello?
- Good morning.

00:31:18.751 --> 00:31:19.669
Hello?

00:31:19.752 --> 00:31:21.921
- I feel so lazy.
- She's in a bad mood, huh?

00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:22.922
Oh my God.

00:31:23.798 --> 00:31:26.759
Let's wake up 'cause
I'm in a good mood today!

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.554
Oh my! Did you all sleep well?

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.559
And then there are days
when the writer of our life wakes up

00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:36.728
ready to talk about love.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:39.981
- Is someone at the door?
- Let's go see.

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.316
- Wait.
- Who could it be?

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:45.236
Hey, are you girls waiting for someone?

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.237
- No.
- No, not me…

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:54.287
- Balloons? Who has balloons?
- I think it's over there, look.

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.373
No, no, stop, girl, I don't know!

00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:59.042
- I think it's…
- You think it's…

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:00.919
- What if it's not--
- Oh, my God!

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:05.590
Who is it?

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.052
You guys! Hi, babe!

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.807
Cry some more, girl, cry!

00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:17.101
Oh, wow, how beautiful!

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:22.357
- Girls, I got flowers!
- Are you happy, my friend?

00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:26.444
That is Su-woong,
Morena's Korean boyfriend.

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:30.031
They met a year ago here in Seoul
and have been together ever since.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.368
The guy is even moving to Brazil.

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.787
It's the perfect love story.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.789
There's just one tiny problem.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:39.165
His mother doesn't want him to.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:46.214
Oh, so romantic!

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.215
Oh my God!

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.217
- I'm so happy!
- It's all so pretty!

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.551
I'm gonna freshen up.

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.136
Bye-bye.

00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:56.265
So, Morena is a very sweet girl.

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:57.266
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.060
Morena is yeppeo.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:00.144
Very, very.

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:01.688
Very, very!

00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:03.314
Repeat after me. Very…

00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.066
- Very…
- Pretty.

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:06.275
Pretty. She's beautiful.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.360
You have to tell her when…

00:33:07.443 --> 00:33:10.279
When she comes down the stairs,
you can say,

00:33:10.363 --> 00:33:11.990
"Morena, very pretty."

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.243
Thank you, thank you for teaching.

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:16.452
Teaching you, yeah.

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:29.590
That was quick.
I've never gotten ready so fast.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.385
- Yes!
- Very pretty.

00:33:32.468 --> 00:33:33.469
Oh, thank you!

00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:37.473
This is perfect!

00:33:38.307 --> 00:33:39.934
- Bye, girlfriend!
- Goodbye!

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.853
- Enjoy it!
- Have fun, girl!

00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:44.480
- Put my flowers in water, please. Okay?
- We will!

00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:46.858
- I'll take it to our room.
- Put them in water.

00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.152
Bye-bye, see you!

00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:50.778
Nice to meet you!

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.321
Bye-bye, have fun.

00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:58.286
Girls, that was crazy!

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:01.205
- Girls, I thought he was the best.
- He's a sweetheart, such a sweetheart.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:02.915
- A total cutie.
- So sweet.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.500
- Very polite.
- Very polite.

00:34:04.584 --> 00:34:08.212
And, you see that he really likes her,
you can tell by the way he looks at her.

00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:11.215
- And they have similar personalities.
- Yeah, girls, their height!

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:12.175
- Yeah.
- He's tall.

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:13.676
- He is tall. Yeah.
- So is she.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.137
Oh, it's just beautiful, right?

00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:22.894
How have you been?

00:34:22.977 --> 00:34:27.732
Even if I am knowing very much about you?

00:34:27.815 --> 00:34:30.109
- Yeah. Oh, coffee!
- Yeah.

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:32.278
Yeah, let's drink something.

00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:35.114
- And talk a little bit. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:37.492
- Yeah, long time no see.
- Yeah.

00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:39.911
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:42.246
- Let's see the menu.
- Yeah.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.041
- May I help you?
- Just a second.

00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:46.459
One Vienna Matcha.

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:48.044
One Vienna Matcha, all right.

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:50.046
Iced strawberry?

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:52.757
Yeah, I want iced tea, strawberry.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.343
One strawberry ice tea,
and one cheesecake.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:01.390
- Morena?
- Yeah?

00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:02.850
How was your flight?

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.769
Yeah, very good.

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:06.479
- Good?
- Very good, yeah.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:08.689
I slept enough.

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.734
- But now I'm very happy because I'm here.
- Me too.

00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:14.862
Very long time, not see you. Hm.

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:17.949
Oh, so nice place!

00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:20.284
- Wow!
- Yeah, that's why we came here.

00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:21.911
You can sit here?

00:35:21.994 --> 00:35:24.330
- Here? Okay, I'll try.
- Yeah, come here.

00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:25.456
Yeah, this is better.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.625
Yeah?

00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:29.544
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.811
- What about your boy?
- Danny?

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:48.980
You two have been talking for how long?

00:35:49.063 --> 00:35:52.942
Girl, for almost… almost a year.

00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.735
- Yeah.
- I would be super anxious.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.154
Yup, just about.

00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.780
- That's a long time, huh?
- Yeah.

00:35:57.864 --> 00:36:02.910
And… it's, uh… you know, we have
very similar things in common, you know?

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.787
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:07.331
I don't want to tell her,

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.960
but the truth is I'm scared to death
that he won't show up.

00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:14.213
Or even worse,
that he doesn't exist. Can you imagine?

00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:19.177
Girl, if… if you don't mind,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.180
I was wondering
what happened to your parents.

00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:24.515
I can tell you about it later.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.147
Some stories are so powerful
that they seem like fiction.

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:36.485
Like Camila's. She left Korea when she was
three years old and never went back.

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:38.529
She has her reasons for that.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.949
All I know is that
it's a story full of holes

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.119
and she's here to try
to piece that puzzle together.

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:48.748
And who knows, maybe find a guy.
The girl deserves it!

00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:57.882
It's very hot.

00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:03.971
So, I was very depressed and sad.

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:07.266
And I need to… Needed to…

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.186
maybe not express my bad feeling to my…

00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:14.941
We think about other people,
especially family, a lot.

00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:16.275
- Mm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:18.194
That's why I…

00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:21.364
I noticed you,

00:37:21.447 --> 00:37:25.910
that you had to wear properly…

00:37:25.993 --> 00:37:27.495
…to meet my mom.

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:30.081
Yeah, I know.

00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:34.835
So my mom also said
that you looked a little strange

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:37.797
when she met you the first time.

00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:41.842
You were wearing some jeans, destroyed.

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.302
- Yeah.
- Torn, so…

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.596
Destroyed jeans not good?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.268
- Hard to imagine for Korean people.
- This is fashion.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.812
- Destroyed jeans.
- So I said to my mom,

00:37:52.895 --> 00:37:56.774
"Mom, that's Morena's best choice,
and she also thought about it a lot."

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:57.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:02.029
Oh, Koreans are so different from us.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.448
Please grant me patience.

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:06.450
Ugly to them is beautiful to me, you know?

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:09.537
What should I wear next time?
Now I'm really nervous, because…

00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:14.166
Because even the first day,
she don't like my clothes.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.044
And second day, what she said?

00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:19.672
- About flower jacket?
- Nothing.

00:38:19.755 --> 00:38:21.549
- You hated my flower jacket.
- Nothing, nothing.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.217
She said nothing.

00:38:24.176 --> 00:38:26.304
But now I don't know what to wear.

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:29.807
Let's go to the, yeah, store together.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.892
- No, I have clothes.
- And then try Korean ones.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.645
No, Korean clothes, it's too small for me.

00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:40.443
Yeah. I also didn't expect my mom would,

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:44.488
yeah, kind of permit to go to Brazil

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:46.240
this fastly.

00:38:46.782 --> 00:38:48.159
Mm-hmm, after meeting you.

00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.211
- Kiss?
- Kiss.

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:06.969
Here has really nice view on the top.

00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.054
- Mm.
- Yeah.

00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.348
- Let's go. yeah. Okay.
- Let's go. Okay.

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:16.270
I thought Su-woong would
bring me piece of mind, but no.

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:17.772
And now there's this.

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:20.399
What do I wear to meet my mother-in-law?

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:49.512
What did you think of Su-woong?

00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:52.390
- Are you thinking about marrying him?
- Of course, God willing!

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:56.477
- I'd marry him tomorrow if I could.
- Oh, get over here!

00:39:58.145 --> 00:39:59.730
That is the dream!

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:03.859
But I'm, like, so grateful to be here and
to be living this moment with all of you.

00:40:03.943 --> 00:40:05.569
- Me too.
- Me too.

00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:07.321
Everything's just perfect.

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.407
Shall we make things even more perfect?

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.242
- Let's!
- Let's make our wish.

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:14.286
- I think we…
- And end the night with soju?

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.206
- And we end the night with soju?
- Soju!

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:18.541
- Let's go?
- Let's go!

00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:23.045
- I think we're here.
- Let's go over here.

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:29.260
So, are you all ready to make your wishes?

00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:31.303
What if things were as beautiful as this?

00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:33.097
Gorgeous, huh?

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.014
I love it.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:38.102
Now I want you all to think of something
very positive, something really nice,

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:41.856
so we can start our trip,
like, on the right foot, okay?

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:42.773
Are we ready?

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.317
From now on,
it's gonna be like anything can happen.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.832
Our fate is sealed.

00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:03.961
Now whether fate will be generous or not,
is a whole other story.

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:21.687
Tall, he has to be tall.
Older than me, and…

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.314
with straight teeth, for God's sake.

00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:24.356
- That's it.
- With what?

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.941
Straight teeth.

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:29.153
- Straight teeth.
- No one wants that, right? No.

00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:31.489
Why don't we go clubbing tonight?

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:34.575
- So I can enjoy myself while I still can?
- While you still can, right?

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.535
While you still don't have
a ring on your finger.

00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:38.829
You can still go out
when you're married, right?

00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.873
Yeah, but… You know.
Then it gets complicated.

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:42.333
He's far away, honey, let's go out.

00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:44.543
- For as long as this lasts.
- Let it all go. Yeah. Let's go.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.722
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:41:57.723 --> 00:42:00.434
Finally he picked up.

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.854
Everyone had met with their guy.
I wasn't about to be left out.

00:42:14.823 --> 00:42:19.286
Tell me, have I lost control?

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.831
Too high, can't come down

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:27.586
Going round and round

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.090
Am I out of my head?

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.468
Don't care what they said

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.222
Every story has a beginning.

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:41.433
But nothing guarantees a happy ending.

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:19.471
Traveling across the world
to meet some guy from Instagram?

00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:22.308
That's crazy,
the internet is no-man's land.

00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:24.643
Who can say that the guy
I've been talking to all this time

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:26.437
is the same that's coming to meet me?

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.443
Mari!
