00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.177
{\an8}Anxiety often accompanies the unknown.

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:15.015
{\an8}I have no idea who said that,
all I know is I agree.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.267
The best feeling is
when anxiety leaves your chest

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.769
and becomes butterflies in your stomach.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.856
That's your body getting ready
to face something for the first time.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.988
How do I know
if the guy I've been talking to

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.240
is the same guy that's coming to meet me?

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.707
Mari!

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.596
How are you?

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.765
I thought I wasn't going to see you.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:58.349
Why not?

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.351
I came here to surprise… Oh!

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.646
You did not pick me up at the airport. No!

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.774
That's how you…

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:10.487
He left me waiting at the airport
and thinks a flower will fix it?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.613
It's from my heart.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:13.406
That's why. Here.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.326
What's worse is… it actually does!

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620
He's perfect, I can't stop smiling.

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:25.752
I was waiting here by myself and
I really thought that no one was coming.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.462
No, of course I'm gonna come.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.214
'Cause you came to Korea to see…

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.758
me? I hope, right?

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.720
Okay, okay.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:36.721
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.515
I really… Yeah, nice to meet you.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.102
Hello, Danny, I'm Mari.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.937
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.482
I'm happy to see you.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.359
I'm happy to see you too. Jinjja.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.610
Jinjja?

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.487
- "Jinjja" means "really". Yeah.
- Jinjja!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.655
Wow, you're tall!

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.697
I'm tall.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.783
- Maybe you're in heels, that's why.
- Yeah. I'm not.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.451
- You're not?
- I'm tall, yeah.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.121
How do you say "pretty" in Portuguese?

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.789
Bonita.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:03.832
Ah, bonita.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.375
Yes. Bonita.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.501
- Bonita?
- Bonita.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.503
You're the pretty one.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.715
So, what should we do now?

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.217
I want to show you around this area,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.844
- 'cause it's really pretty.
- Okay.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.595
Yeah, let's go. I will follow you.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.555
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.098
Are you ready?

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.599
- I'm so ready!
- Okay.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:31.442
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.789
Sometimes,
you simply leave things up to fate. Like…

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.251
…going to a Korean night club.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:56.301
- Hey, sexy ladies!
- Sexy ladies!

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.020
What happens in Seoul stays in Seoul?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.148
Wow, they're so hot. Oh yeah!

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.863
Cheers to our trip!

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.539
You should go check out the boys.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.791
I'm trying to avoid eye contact.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:36.883
Where are you from?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.009
Oh, Brazil.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:39.969
- Brazil?
- Yeah.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.513
Hello!

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.932
- Hello!
- Hi! Yes! Hi!

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.516
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.476
Hi!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.728
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you!

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:50.855
My name is Jiuan.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.107
- Jiuan.
- Welcome to Korea.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.609
Thank you!

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.527
Welcome to Korea.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.612
Welcome to Korea.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:58.655
Thank you.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.244
Are you Korean?

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.662
Yeah, I'm Korean.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.748
I was born here, but I live in Brazil.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.168
So, when did you go to Brazil?

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.754
When I was three years old.

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:15.797
Three years old?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.714
Yeah.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.634
I thought it had been longer.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:20.802
Huh?

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.428
It's not as long ago as I thought.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.888
What? Three years?

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.349
- I was three years old.
- Huh?

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.850
- That I was three.
- You were three?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:28.810
Yeah.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.312
He's nice to look at,
but this conversation is rough.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:34.482
I guess annoying guys at clubs
are a universal thing.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.735
Well, at least the girls are having fun.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.821
- You speak Korean?
- I speak Korean.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.283
Just job or travel?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.451
- I'm travel.
- No, no, no!

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.453
- Okay!
- No, no, no!

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.289
I'm… Uh…

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.290
Never!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.874
- Vacation.
- Vacation?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:52.959
Yeah.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.128
Hey, this one is cute, babe.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.756
I don't want anything.
He's so freakin' annoying.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.926
Wow, Camila's really picky, isn't she?

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.398
You brought me to this place
for a specific reason?

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.566
You like this place?

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.650
Yeah, I mean, like…

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.820
This is one of the landmarks of Seoul.

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:23.323
I thought it would be
a good place to start, you know?

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:27.368
We've been talking for, like,
almost half a year now, right?

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.245
In the airport… Uh…

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.163
Oh, right. Yeah.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.831
In the airport, it was a little bit, like…

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:33.166
Hmm, that's not…

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.251
I wish he was here.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.713
What really happened that day?
You told me it was a family problem.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:40.340
Yeah, I mean, like…

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.924
So, I had to…

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.177
Basically I just had to help my dad, like,

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:46.971
with something with his company.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.348
Yeah.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.849
I'm sorry. So sorry.

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.184
How can I reply to that?

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.685
- Like… No problem.
- No problem.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.270
- It's all good…
- Yeah, all good.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.522
- Really, no problem.
- Okay.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.316
Well, anyways…

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.860
Oh, you've been going to the gym, right?

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.570
- Especially this morning.
- Oh my God.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.073
You went to the gym this morning?

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:07.700
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:08.618
Show me.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.370
- Oh my God!
- No, I'm just kidding.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.877
Do you think that I look similar
from the photos and videos?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.381
Actually, yeah. Like,
when you turned around, I was like…

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.091
Mm.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:25.009
It was overwhelming, I mean…

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.429
- Handsome?
- Pretty.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.931
- Pretty.
- That's right.

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:30.890
Okay, got it.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.975
Do you have anything you wanna do?

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.520
Anything you need?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.854
Just tell me.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.815
Just you in my life, Danny.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.942
Just kidding.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.154
Did you cut your hair?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.489
Yes.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.366
Can I touch your hair?
I'm already touching it.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.283
No!

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.701
Yeah, you can touch my hair.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:53.746
Yeah, you cut it a little bit, right?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.832
I mean, it was very messy. So…

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:56.833
I gotta…

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:57.792
I like your hair.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.085
- I gotta look clean.
- Yay.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:05.174
The way he looks at me,
damn, I just can't.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.301
Do I feel like kissing him?

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.679
Yeah.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:16.936
But let's take it slow, because
things are different here in Korea.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.148
Right now, I think I have to go.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.067
Because I'm a little bit tired
and, actually, I'm freezing cold.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.360
- Okay, yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.362
Let me say goodbye to you.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.197
Yeah. I mean…

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.740
Okay.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.536
Mm. Thank you for coming.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.663
- Thank you.
- All right, see you soon.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:37.123
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.666
- Okay.
- Okay, bye-bye.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.166
Does she have a boyfriend?

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.585
- Yeah, she has a boyfriend. Yeah.
- Oh.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.045
What did he say?

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.880
If you have a boyfriend.

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:28.716
Girl, he's cute!
I don't get why you don't like him.

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:31.135
- Oh yeah, but…
- Come on, just kiss him.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.095
No way! I'm not gonna kiss him.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.807
I tried, I swear.
But it's not gonna happen, not now.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.726
I've been all over the place
since I got here.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.061
We have to go.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.606
I'm really confused. I don't think
it's the right time to get to know anyone.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.194
Bye-bye.

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:49.862
Bye.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.876
You've been always on my mind

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.379
- It's hard to get out of bed today.
- Good morning.

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:08.839
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, girls.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.425
- What's up?
- Morning, my loves.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:12.760
Sit here, Morena.

00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:15.304
I need my girls'
undivided attention, please.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.390
'Cause I need to tell you
what happened yesterday.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:19.725
- Oh yeah?
- Tell us, tell us, we wanna know.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.937
I mean, I swear, it was like a scene

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.732
directly out of a K-drama. I was waiting
for him, like, "Oh God, where is he?"

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:30.194
And suddenly,
I hear my name coming from behind me.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.654
I almost choked.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.322
He was holding a flower in his hand.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.158
He was hiding it
and then he gave it to me.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.829
Then he apologized
for not picking me up at the airport.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:42.957
I mean, the chemistry is undeniable.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.294
You can feel there's
something there, you know?

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.213
Like a… a desire to be together.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.631
I mean, damn, girlfriend.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.633
I can't wait to see him again. For real.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.512
Did you set a date? Did you talk about it?
Do you know when you'll see him again?

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.555
Oh yeah, for sure.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.307
- Anything you want to do?
- And his height?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.850
- Is he tall?
- He's my height.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.144
- That's good!
- Yeah, like…

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.646
Oh, well, that's good.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.442
Even better than experiencing
something for the first time…

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:12.945
is talking about it.
It's reliving the best parts.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.906
But then, once it's out there,
you start overthinking,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.034
and you're back to square one.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.119
I like guys who make me suffer.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:21.829
We can see that.

00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:25.082
No, babe, love is stable, it's calm.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.083
Is it?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.501
Yeah. Of course it is.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.087
It's not fighting and
craziness all the time.

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.173
No, no, we don't fight all the time.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:33.424
No?

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:36.302
I like excitement in a relationship.
Am I supposed to have a boring one?

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.429
My first relationship was chaos.

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:40.431
You don't think this one is also chaotic?

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.433
The first one was much worse.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:45.019
Like, to the point where he wanted
to rip my clothes with a knife.

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:53.819
The people you've been in relationships
with all have similar characteristics.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.822
Their actions repeat a pattern.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:11:00.451
And that's something
you don't even notice,

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.995
but it's always happening.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.456
- He treats me like a princess…
- Lots to unpack.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:09.126
…he doesn't curse at me,
he doesn't humiliate me, you know?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.587
- He doesn't do those things.
- Who?

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.673
- Si-won doesn't do those things.
- That's good, right?

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.270
Sometimes I think, "My Lord,
I came to Korea of all places

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.357
and then met a guy
who was a perfect match for me."

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.776
At times I had my doubts,
like, does he like me,

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:37.530
or am I totally making it up it because
I'm crazy and excited, you know?

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:40.574
I don't know if you notice
the way he looks at you.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.744
You look at each other,
like, the same way. With a lot of love.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.329
I thought, "that's real love."

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.956
Where's the ring?
Where's my friend's ring?

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.708
That's so sweet!

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:52.294
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't wait!

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.505
- Absolutely!
- Yeah, I can't wait to go to your wedding.

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:55.673
- I'm all like…
- Me too!

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.133
Ah! Hold up.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.468
- They express themselves…
- A message.

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:01.429
Wait.

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.639
Is everything okay?

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.853
Can you help me translate this?

00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:09.979
"Luanny,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.650
the day we meet again,
I want to confess something

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.026
you didn't know."

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:21.240
"Maybe you'll be shocked
if you hear my story,

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:25.035
but now I want to be as honest
as possible with you."

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:31.500
"It's already in the past and
I don't want to hurt your heart."

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.294
"The day we meet again,

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.172
I'll tell you everything."

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.173
"See you soon."

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.800
What's he gotta tell her?

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:48.267
It must be serious
if he thinks it'll shock her.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.019
I'm having an anxiety attack.

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.397
What is it now?

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:54.565
Does he have another family?

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:56.776
Was he arrested? Fuck!

00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:59.195
Not a single moment of peace
with this guy.

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.032
I wouldn't be able to take
the suspense. I'd call him now.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.867
I would have called him already.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.494
I… I should wait.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.079
And let him say it to my face.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:19.924
Girl, I hope it's something positive
that will help your relationship.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:21.717
Because if it's just another issue…

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.220
- Yeah, no more problems.
- More dilemmas?

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:27.556
Well, yeah, it's a problem.
There's no way it's not a problem.

00:13:28.432 --> 00:13:32.144
You should prepare yourself for the worst,
and then when you get there,

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.312
it might not be that bad.

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:35.189
- That's the worst part.
- But that's shitty,

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:37.733
- 'cause you'll just be wondering.
- He knows I have anxiety.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.987
I didn't sleep last night
and I won't again tonight.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.073
Look.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.951
It's out of your control, you know.

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:49.495
So you should just wait, stay calm.

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.541
Just ask him when would be
the best time for you two to talk.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.924
{\an8}Now I'm shaking.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.094
{\an8}He keeps typing and deleting.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:08.180
{\an8}Yeah, let's wait.

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:11.475
- He said we should meet tonight.
- Tonight?

00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:13.894
Have some water.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:14.979
I need it.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.365
Tonight is full of possibilities.

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.826
On one hand, there's tension and doubt.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:32.454
On the other,
an unexpected invitation to dinner.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.374
As the minutes drag on,
the only thing I'm sure of

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:38.711
is that this night
will change our lives forever.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.213
Yeah, honey!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.007
You slayed babe, slayed.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.466
- Preach.
- Girl, I love it.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.176
- Perfect, stunning.
- Honey, that's it.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.303
- You'll be matching.
- Yeah.

00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:17.249
He sent a car.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:21.545
Flowers.

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.256
Su-woong has never done this.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.134
I don't think today is just a dinner.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.855
Okay, let's go.

00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:56.455
He wrote, "We're going to meet where

00:15:56.538 --> 00:16:01.251
the horizon kisses the sky,
and tonight will be unforgettable."

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:06.840
Where is this place,
and why is it unforgettable? Oh my God!

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:40.749
Oh my goodness!

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.461
Oh, my God!

00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.089
- Hi, Su-woong.
- Hello.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.632
Oh, my God!

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.176
How are you? What you mean?

00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:56.140
- Nice flowers?
- Yeah, thank you very much!

00:16:56.223 --> 00:16:57.516
How handsome!

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.561
- So beautiful, pretty today.
- Oh my God! My heart! Thank you.

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:07.568
Look at this restaurant! And this view!

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:10.195
He's going to propose to me.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.952
And I always thought you are not romantic,
but you are romance.

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.080
- You're red here. Can I clean?
- Red?

00:17:20.164 --> 00:17:21.040
Yeah, sure.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:22.249
Lipstick.

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:28.088
I love your lip color today.

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:29.590
You like red, I know.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:32.718
- Cheers. To us.
- Cheers.

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:34.261
- To us.
- Thank you very much.

00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:35.721
- This is so nice.
- You're welcome.

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:38.640
Romantic boy, I very love.

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.482
Oh, thank you.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.111
Actually, I was thinking
I need to wear a dress,

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:53.697
but I didn't bring a dress for this.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.115
Yeah, yeah. And cold.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:59.787
And when I saw this picture I said,
"Oh my God, I don't have clothes to wear."

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.456
Ooh, you look really good.

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.875
- And I like blue. Blue.
- Blue?

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.002
- Yeah, I like color.
- Mm.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.129
- Mm…
- You don't use so much color,

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:10.714
but I like color.

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:16.553
Eat very carefully,
maybe the ring is in there.

00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:18.889
So, I prepared…

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.600
Oh no.

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:23.143
Morena, don't cry.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.729
Don't cry, it'll ruin your makeup.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.106
- Hm?
- Show me.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.191
- Hm?
- Show me, please.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.984
Show you or should I read?

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.903
Oh, I don't know. You choose.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:38.575
No, it's not just dinner.
Oh my God, now what?

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:41.662
A letter?

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.135
Oh God, what does he have to say?

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.680
Will I know when to call it quits
in this relationship?

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:19.241
Luanny!

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:24.163
You're not wrapped up well,
so I brought you this.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.707
You remember this coat, right?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.459
I figured you wouldn't have
enough warm clothes.

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:30.961
So I got it for you.

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:36.925
Can I take it back to Brazil?

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:41.430
Of course you can,
but isn't it always hot there?

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:46.059
This place is beautiful, don't you think?

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:48.353
Look at those lights.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.855
Over there, see?

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:52.065
Aren't they beautiful?

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:00.324
Luanny…

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:05.954
There's something I need to confess.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.295
You didn't cheat, right?

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:15.881
You asked me…

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.801
about my financial… situation.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.720
And now I want to tell you the truth.

00:20:21.803 --> 00:20:22.971
The reason why I had

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:24.514
such a…

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:26.642
complicated life…

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:29.895
is because my family…

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:35.567
went through some hard times.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.112
When I was a student,

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:42.491
my parents were in serious debt.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:48.288
We'd have loan sharks
come to our house all the time.

00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:51.625
And so I…

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:55.879
grew up…

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.468
I grew up exposed…

00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:04.221
to that kind of stuff.

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:08.850
Wait. Ah…

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.440
I'm not good at dealing
with this kind of stuff.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.901
I get really anxious
and my heart starts racing.

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.787
I want to read for you.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.625
"Hi, Morena."

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.462
"You used to live
on the other side of the world."

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.590
"So, how did we meet?"

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:46.221
"The way we made it through this distance

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:51.393
must have been
more than just a simple attraction."

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:54.021
"There must have been
something special beyond that."

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:03.530
"Sometimes I feel like time flew by
like lightning since I met you."

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:09.870
"During that time, I was very happy,

00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:12.205
and I believe you were happy too."

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.547
"Of course we faced some challenges
and misunderstandings,

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.632
especially when we were apart."

00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:27.429
"But even with that,
I can feel something clear."

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.723
"You always gave me your true heart."

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:35.103
"I may not remember
all of your words and wishes,

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.522
but I know what you want the most."

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.196
"I want to make those hopes come true."

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:46.448
"Because…

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.575
I want that too."

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:51.244
Me too.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.872
"Let's stop being apart."

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.250
"And on the same side,

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:01.004
and build our family together."

00:23:01.088 --> 00:23:02.589
Mm-hmm.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:04.841
So…

00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:17.813
So…

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:19.981
Will you marry me?

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:27.197
- Answer. Answer me.
- I want, yes.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:30.659
Thank you. I love you.

00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:40.669
Oh, my God!

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.546
Thank you.

00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:46.049
- Su-woong!
- Thank you so much.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:47.217
I love you.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.468
I love you.

00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.310
This is a dream.

00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:00.147
My Korean boyfriend
became my Korean fiancé.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.608
Our "happily ever after"
is just beginning.

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:07.154
I just hope his mother feels the same.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.699
How do you know my size?

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:25.505
In our house…

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.760
Mm, don't cry.

00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:32.971
It's okay, baby.

00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:36.183
We could barely make ends meet.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:40.854
When I went…

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:45.775
to college to study and I…

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.237
made new friends, they wanted

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.240
to go out to eat one day…

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:54.701
and I…

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:01.124
Don't cry, baby.

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.918
Back then, I didn't…

00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:09.466
have a penny to my name.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.261
So I made up an excuse.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:14.679
]Luanny] Sorry.

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:20.227
I said I was still… full from breakfast.

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:22.812
I lied to them.

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.318
I can't tell you

00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:33.573
how much I cried in the bathroom that day.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:42.499
I didn't understand
why my childhood had been so hard.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.835
And why I had to be poor.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.339
And why I couldn't have

00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.675
a regular cellphone.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.553
Like everyone else had.

00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:56.930
When I was a student,

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:01.935
I'd envy my friends
because of their phones.

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:03.853
So,

00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:09.150
ever since I was young, I wanted to make

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:11.778
quick and easy money.

00:26:12.862 --> 00:26:14.489
But I'd lose everything…

00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:16.408
investing.

00:26:17.117 --> 00:26:18.034
Then at one point,

00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:21.788
I just started losing more and more.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.456
And now,

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:25.917
I'm paying off…

00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:29.296
all my debt.

00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:33.258
And to be honest,
when you first came to Korea…

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.724
I felt so guilty, because you came

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.184
from another country.

00:26:45.895 --> 00:26:46.813
And…

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:51.818
- I couldn't afford to offer you much.
- Don't cry, baby.

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.697
I really couldn't afford it.

00:26:56.531 --> 00:26:57.574
I felt so…

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:09.336
I'm going to try really hard.

00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:11.713
Because I'm seriously considering

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:14.090
a future

00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:15.300
with you.

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.347
And I'll do it for Ayla as well.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.099
From now on,

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:27.354
it'll be you, Ayla, and me.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:30.440
We'll have a stable, peaceful life.

00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.319
We'll build our future together.

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:37.447
I'm sorry.

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:40.158
You know why…

00:27:41.534 --> 00:27:43.286
I'm a little harsh sometimes?

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.122
Because…

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:49.167
it hurts me to see you work so hard.

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:53.630
Every day, you call me and say, "Oh,
my back hurts, I'm working all the time,

00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:56.007
and in the end, I have nothing."

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:58.134
Do you think that makes me happy?

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:00.970
How are we going to build a life?

00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:03.807
That's why I'm hard on you.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:05.975
You think I wanna see you like this?

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.062
Big baby.

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.360
I already have a daughter.
I can't take care of a grown man too.

00:28:17.153 --> 00:28:19.072
It makes me sad to hear those things.

00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:21.574
But if we're together,
we have to join forces.

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:24.536
Can I tell you something?

00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:29.541
Hey, hang on.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.335
There's something I need to tell you.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.714
When you first got here, I was…

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:39.300
I had absolutely no money
when you first came.

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:41.302
I was totally broke.

00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:43.722
I was so, so broke.

00:28:44.764 --> 00:28:46.683
But my family thinks I paid for your trip!

00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:49.602
But I actually paid for it.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:52.981
I know.

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:55.734
Then I'm going to tell your family
I paid for it.

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.527
Forgive me.

00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.447
I don't forgive you.

00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:03.408
It's all good.

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:05.744
We can get through this.

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:07.996
Okay?

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.916
Now, if you screw up again,
I'll hit you over the head.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.501
Clear?

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.086
All right.

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:18.256
I promise I'll do exactly

00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:21.301
what you tell me.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:24.429
I'll straighten out from now on.

00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:48.995
He opened up about really personal things.

00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:54.584
His parents divorced
when he was really young.

00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:57.295
They divorced because
his father was in a lot of debt.

00:29:57.378 --> 00:29:59.547
Loan sharks would come
to his house and break things.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.510
That kind of traumatized him.

00:30:04.093 --> 00:30:07.263
And that became a cycle.
He would always think about that.

00:30:07.347 --> 00:30:10.141
He wondered why life
had to be so hard for him.

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.852
Why did everyone have
the things he couldn't have?

00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:16.815
Why did his family have
to be so messed up?

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.150
But I didn't know how to help him,

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:23.571
because I could tell it was
very hard for him to talk about that.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:25.240
It was hard for him to open up.

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.283
I don't know how to handle
these situations.

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:31.496
I don't wanna be anyone's shrink.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.040
Because I have my own issues.

00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:37.168
And I also want someone
to help me through them.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:38.378
Yeah, girl. For sure.

00:30:38.878 --> 00:30:41.840
So it's hard to deal with
my personal problems…

00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:44.217
- No, it's…
- …and other people's problems.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.301
Yeah, look…

00:30:46.052 --> 00:30:47.387
His issues…

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.889
Hearing all this now,

00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:53.685
I understand what's going on
in his head a little better.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:59.732
But that doesn't cancel out your issues,
your story and your life. Right?

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:01.651
Because everyone has issues, babe.

00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:03.611
Isn't his family wealthy?

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.697
- Nowadays they are.
- Not back then?

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.156
Not back then.

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.285
Why doesn't he ask
his family for money then?

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:11.619
He's 35 years old.

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.371
He can't keep asking them for money.

00:31:13.454 --> 00:31:15.081
Then why does he ask you?

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.959
I don't know.
I think he feels less humiliated

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.169
asking a woman for help
than asking his family.

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:24.841
You're working hard every day to make
ends meet, to take care of your daughter,

00:31:24.924 --> 00:31:26.509
your mom, have your things.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.596
Then here comes pretty boy
asking you for money,

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.556
even though his family is wealthy?

00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:32.473
What?

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:34.392
For God's sake!

00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:37.353
They don't get that
Si-won also has great qualities.

00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:41.858
But I also understand that the few flaws
that he has can ruin our future.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:48.698
{\an8}We feel like there's a huge weight
on your shoulders, you know?

00:31:49.198 --> 00:31:51.492
{\an8}And I don't want you
to have to carry that weight.

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:54.787
So, I want you to really think about
what you want for your future.

00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:56.748
Sometimes,
even if you want to be with him,

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.458
it may not be the right path for you.

00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:00.585
Because it will just hurt you.

00:32:02.462 --> 00:32:05.423
It's really good to hear
what each of you have to say.

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.343
Because you guys see the big picture.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.803
I'm inside the relationship,
so we get a little…

00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.305
- Blinded, right?
- Yeah.

00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:17.143
So, hearing your opinions,
it makes me even more confused, you know?

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.146
'Cause a lot of these things
seemed normal to me.

00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:24.025
I love him, so I would just deal with it.
I saw it as part of the relationship.

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:28.488
When I see you guys talking about
what relationships should be like,

00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.199
that certain things are not normal,

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:36.079
then I start thinking, "What am I
getting myself into? What am I doing?"

00:32:36.162 --> 00:32:38.039
"How is this going to affect my future?"

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:39.540
So now I have doubts.

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:42.835
I'm not saying I'm going to be like,
"It's over, fuck off."

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:46.214
I'm just saying
it's really making me think twice.

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.548
It really is.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.597
When doubt takes over,
the only thing left to do is

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:55.723
go back to what's certain.

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.142
And in Seoul, that means skin care.

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:01.104
Because comfort also comes in little jars.

00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:09.696
Girls, this is
the perfect neighborhood to shop. Right?

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:11.114
Girl, there's so much stuff.

00:33:11.197 --> 00:33:13.116
- I can't wait!
- Where should we get our skin care?

00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:14.659
- Oh no, we need it.
- Makeup.

00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.494
- We need the makeup…
- I'm gonna need your help.

00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:17.954
I don't know anything about this.

00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:20.164
I really need to take care of my skin,

00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:23.209
because I have some big
news to tell you all.

00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:24.752
- What's that?
- I have to look gorgeous.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.129
So let's buy a lot of skin care,

00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:27.714
because I'm getting married.

00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:31.134
Let's see!

00:33:33.428 --> 00:33:34.345
Girl.

00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:37.306
- Let's go get you a Chanel dress!
- Let's go!

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.267
Let's trade this ring for skin care!

00:33:39.892 --> 00:33:42.603
- Congratulations, honey!
- Thank you!

00:33:43.187 --> 00:33:44.897
- You must have cried so much!
- Oh my God.

00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:46.691
Come here, group hug!

00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:51.404
- We have a bride-to-be in the group!
- Finally, girl!

00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:52.864
You're gonna get run over!

00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:54.824
We have a lot of things to buy then.

00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:57.076
First, our skin has to look gorgeous.
'Cause the wedding…

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.162
- Yes, girl, for the wedding.
- It's this year.

00:33:59.245 --> 00:34:00.371
I'm getting married this year.

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.922
- Don't you wanna go in?
- Let's go.

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:15.053
Ugh, I can't even fit
everything I want in my luggage.

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:17.722
This is the only thing better than Danny.

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:20.725
Amazing!

00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:23.311
- I want an eyeliner.
- Guys, I want that thing

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.521
that makes your lips red, you know?

00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:26.606
- The one like…
- Lip tint?

00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:28.149
- Lip balm.
- It's right here.

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:29.233
- Yes!
- There's a lip tint.

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:31.152
- I saw these…
- More expensive, you know.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:34.155
Guys, I'm loving this girls' moment.

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:37.575
And we have a bride-to-be in the group.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:38.743
Did you cry?

00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:40.536
Oh my Lord! I died!

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.539
- I can't even. I didn't cry, I died.
- No way!

00:34:43.623 --> 00:34:46.042
- Ladies!
- It's all good.

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:47.085
Sorry, babe.

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:48.920
Guys…

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:52.632
I'm so happy with my ring. Oh God!

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:01.099
We're home!

00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:03.267
- Guys, I'm so tired.
- Damn!

00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.019
- It was so nice.
- I'm legit exhausted.

00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.438
So much fun.
There's all sorts of things over there.

00:35:07.522 --> 00:35:09.524
Girls, I went all out with my shopping.

00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:13.486
This feels so good!

00:35:13.986 --> 00:35:16.697
We could have
a little celebration tonight.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.158
You know, have a party here at home.

00:35:19.242 --> 00:35:20.451
- I'd love a party.
- Right?

00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:21.577
I'm in.

00:35:21.661 --> 00:35:24.413
- Let's call all the boys?
- I'm going to see my fiancé!

00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:27.208
- Wear something white!
- Party!

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.106
Hello!

00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:51.816
- Hi!
- Oh my God. Wait!

00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:54.861
How are you guys?

00:35:54.944 --> 00:35:56.112
Hello, Mari!

00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:57.655
Hello, Danny!

00:35:57.738 --> 00:35:59.240
Nice to see you again.

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.534
Oh, nice to see you too.

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:03.077
- Hello, guys.
- Hi.

00:36:03.786 --> 00:36:05.538
How are you? I'm Mariana.

00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:07.582
{\an8}- I'm Iurii.
- Oh, that's nice.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:09.959
{\an8}- Welcome to the crib!
- Wow!

00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:16.591
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. I'm so ready. Can I look?

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.676
- No, you cannot look now.
- I can't look yet?

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:20.720
- Okay, when can I look?
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:36:20.803 --> 00:36:21.679
When can I look?

00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:23.014
Now, now you can look.

00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:25.391
Whoa!

00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:27.894
Now you can look.

00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:30.229
- Wow. Whoa, whoa, look at that.
- Yeah!

00:36:30.313 --> 00:36:32.648
This is the… All this is the view.

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:34.317
You guys live here?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.610
Yeah, we do.

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:36.777
Can we join you guys?

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.905
- Yeah, you guys just move here.
- Yes, of course.

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:41.199
Cheers!

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:42.950
Cheers!

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.202
Drink mine, drink mine.

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:49.707
Jack!

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.209
Jack is here!

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.127
Good drinks, good company.

00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:57.673
Let's see if Jack loosens up a little
bit more, here in my natural habitat.

00:36:57.757 --> 00:37:00.676
- Jack is here! Hello, Jack!
- Hello!

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.345
- Hello.
- Hi, Jack.

00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:05.139
Hello! How are you?

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.682
Katy is screwed.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.311
- Hello.
- Jack has arrived.

00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:12.563
Nice to meet you.

00:37:12.647 --> 00:37:15.274
Let's hear, like, who is Jack.

00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:17.235
Introduce yourself.

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:22.240
Wow, what a great start.
He went and sat way the hell over there.

00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:23.241
Perfect.

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:25.201
No, nothing.

00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:26.994
Do you?

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:30.706
Oh yeah, you've been here for ten years.
So you speak three languages, right?

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:31.916
Yeah, three languages.

00:37:32.833 --> 00:37:35.169
Yeah, I speak three… I speak two.

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:39.131
I understand a lot of Spanish,
because I used to have it at school.

00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:41.801
It was like English and Spanish.

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.178
And…

00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:48.808
And Mandarin now. One day I'll be fluent.

00:37:49.558 --> 00:37:52.311
It's gonna be good. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:55.147
I'll ask you to teach me. "How are you?"

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.440
- How are you?
- Hi, everyone.

00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:57.984
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, everyone. I'm Katy.

00:37:58.067 --> 00:37:59.819
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.788
In Portuguese, "baitola."
Yeah, and "bicha."

00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:12.748
Bicha.

00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:13.958
- Bicha?
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:19.088
Five minutes talking to Danny's friend

00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:22.591
is already feeling better than
a whole afternoon with Jack.

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:23.843
Is it a sign?

00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:35.146
No, just sometimes.

00:38:35.229 --> 00:38:37.815
Oh my God! Oh my God!

00:38:37.898 --> 00:38:40.026
- Oh my God!
- Hello!

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.738
Hey, hey, hey! Too much!

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.364
Too much! Stop! Stop!

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:47.241
Oh, kill me now!

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:48.242
Hello.

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:52.204
- I'm gonna go jump off a bridge, hold up.
- Damn, girl, please stop.

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.502
Here comes the fiancé!

00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:01.422
Oh, praise the Lord!

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.049
How handsome!

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:09.805
- Cheers to the bride and groom!
- Cheers to the bride and groom!

00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:15.853
I think their ring taste is really bad.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:18.522
So, Danny is Camila's couple.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.068
Never!

00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:24.195
Honestly, I'm very nervous.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:25.571
Why?

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:26.655
You with me?

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.240
I don't know.

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:31.535
Because… I think…

00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:32.912
It's such a big couch.

00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:35.164
They are Brazilian girls.

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:41.379
They have a very strange… strange…

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.005
Strange?

00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:43.923
…personality.

00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:45.883
Me too?

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:47.218
That's why you and me fight?

00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:49.470
The thing about Camila… Let me explain.

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.471
Strong. Strong.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.389
They are…

00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.100
This is Brazilian type of personality.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.185
We are stranger,

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:58.938
and crazy, and noisy…

00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:02.817
- This is Brazil.
- Mm.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.446
If you don't like it,
just take your stuff and go.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.532
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:15.079
What do you think about
our future together?

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:16.872
I don't know.

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:17.790
You don't know?

00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:20.876
Now, I don't know.

00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.754
Now? Now you don't know?

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:27.049
Because I just say to you

00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:31.595
Brazilian girls have a personality,
a strong personality.

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:32.513
Yeah.

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.390
- A strong personality.
- But every time you just say,

00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:36.058
"Brazilian, blah, blah, blah, blah."

00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:37.560
What do you want?

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:44.400
I just wanted him to meet my friends

00:40:44.483 --> 00:40:46.986
and for them to realize what I see in him.

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:50.573
But he just got here
and we're already arguing.

00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:53.242
We can barely understand each other.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:56.871
But, come on, I'm not gonna use
the translator at a party.

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.207
I don't like this guy.

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.167
Who?

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.544
- Luanny's boyfriend.
- Why?

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.423
I really want to know more about him,

00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:10.509
and I want to hear from him.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.887
But he's not…

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.804
What?

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.557
He doesn't make good to her?

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.809
Really? He's not good to her?

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:19.727
Yeah.

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:22.563
He's not someone that…

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.025
You guys talked about this?

00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:27.776
Yeah. Um…

00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:32.156
There's a few things
that he's been doing about, um…

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.534
Wrong things he's been doing.

00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:37.828
And she's still there.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.997
She's still there for him.

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:43.209
And she's been suffering a lot.

00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:44.460
Yeah.

00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:49.048
- Wanna switch seats?
- You can say. Tell me.

00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:50.508
I can speak Korean.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.968
- Well.
- Really?

00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:54.428
- You speak well.
- Very well.

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:57.765
I was just telling Luanny
that you girls seem to be

00:41:58.265 --> 00:41:59.683
just a little bit…

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.228
You're just…

00:42:03.103 --> 00:42:06.690
kind of straightforward
and you've got strong personalities.

00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:10.569
- That's what I was saying.
- Is that how… we seem to you?

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:11.487
Yeah.

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.239
Strong personalities?

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.866
What is that…

00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:17.576
supposed to mean?

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:23.916
- I don't know what the problem is…
- Who's got strong personalities? We do?

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:25.876
- All of us?
- Yes.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.045
- The girls.
- Just the girls?

00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:30.798
When you explain that in Korean…

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.093
I can understand.

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:35.928
But in English…

00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.266
- Mm, right.
- It's different, you know? Is…

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.392
Mm.

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.730
Why do you look upset?

00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:48.983
It's just…

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.360
I don't like the way she talked to me.

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.320
It made me upset.

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.780
Why is that?

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:56.407
Wait.

00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:58.534
It's because she…

00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:00.744
When I said that,

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.371
I didn't mean--

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:05.291
- It's hard for you two to communicate.
- Yeah.

00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:08.127
I know we have a communication problem.

00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:09.753
We do.

00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:10.879
Low… Down…

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.298
Okay, okay.

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:15.509
I know we have a communication issue.

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:19.888
I don't know why she's saying she's having
second thoughts about our relationship.

00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:22.391
Why? Because that's how she's feeling.

00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:25.352
She can't do that?
She can't tell you that?

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.771
That topic is over.

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:32.651
What a joke.

00:43:35.362 --> 00:43:36.447
What happened?

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.865
Nothing. What a fucking asshole.

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:40.326
He can go fuck himself.
So fucking annoying.

00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:42.286
He was upset for no reason.

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.751
Camila, are you okay?

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:50.878
Girl, that guy is so annoying.

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:55.215
All he says is "Brazilian women
have a strong personality."

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.925
Shit, if you don't want a Brazilian…

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:57.885
No!

00:43:57.968 --> 00:44:00.638
That's what I'm saying,
you can't communicate.

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:03.015
He meant that in a good way, you know?

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:07.645
But he's so fucking annoying. So annoying.

00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:11.023
Don't let her touch his hair.
She likes touching hairs.

00:44:11.106 --> 00:44:12.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:13.859
Are you okay?

00:44:16.862 --> 00:44:18.113
You okay? Really?

00:44:18.947 --> 00:44:20.115
No?

00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:21.075
Why?

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:24.161
Don't cry now. Girl, now's not the time.

00:44:24.244 --> 00:44:25.663
Let's go downstairs.

00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:28.749
Let's go downstairs, come.

00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:30.584
Downstairs, come on.

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:33.379
What do we do when
who we thought was our person

00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:35.422
turns into a complete stranger?

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:43.263
The butterflies in your stomach go
up to your chest and become anxiety.

00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:45.683
Is this how it's all going to end?
