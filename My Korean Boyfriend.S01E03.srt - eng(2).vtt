WEBVTT

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.975
What a joke.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.852
Um…

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.729
What an asshole.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.495
I think I just came to Korea
to end my relationship.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.789
Girl, it's like I told you.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.624
Certain things happen

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.587
to really open your eyes.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.968
Let's go downstairs.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.845
Come on, Luanny.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:57.682
Leave it there.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.239
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:29.714
One of the hardest things in life
is stepping out of your comfort zone.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.135
In order to leave somewhere,

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.305
we have to believe
that's not the place we're meant to be.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.226
It's like understanding
the right measure of a hug.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.312
How comforting,
or how suffocating it can be.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.233
There are so many places here
I wanna visit.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.068
You have to help me.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.237
I was born here,
but I don't know it at all.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.864
How old were you when you moved to Brazil?

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.907
I was three years old.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.036
- And you never came back, right?
- No, I came back 28 years later.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.456
Did you go to Brazil with
your mom and your dad, or what?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.544
I left with my dad
and my aunts and uncles.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.712
And my grandma and my sister.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.506
And your mother?

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.049
I don't know my mother.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:19.389
I've been trying
to live in the present, you know?

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.057
What happened is in the past.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.559
I wanna create new stories.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.646
Until recently, I had
an emotional block about coming here.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:27.981
I had opportunities,

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.900
but I never wanted to come
because of my history.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.904
And now I have the opportunity
to be here with you guys.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.739
Especially because it's super cool.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.326
I think I'll make good memories
before I go back to Brazil.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.787
Maybe I'll want to come back again,
you know?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.455
To know the country better.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.541
See where my mother came from.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.460
- Are they from Seoul or somewhere else?
- They're from Seoul.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:50.503
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.591
What do you think is good to do here?

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.134
Something cool for us to…

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.887
I really wanted to wear
a hanbok with you guys.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.389
There's the Hanok Village, you know?

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.224
Su-woong never did it with me.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.852
I really wanna see him wearing a hanbok.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:10.940
Last time I booked a photoshoot,
and he didn't even show up.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.151
Oh, we can do it with you, Morena.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:14.611
- I did it last time I came.
- Please.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.695
Please.

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:18.615
I'll call Su-woong
and throw it in his face

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.326
that I'm going to wear a hanbok
with someone else.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.995
I'll be like, "See?
You didn't want to do it with me."

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.747
Doesn't he want to go with us?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.873
- No?
- I don't think so.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.420
Hello?

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:35.215
Good morning! This is Morena.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.299
How are you?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.551
Yeah, I'm fine, and you?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.553
Yeah, I'm fine too.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.181
- I'm very happy.
- Just wondering where we're going.

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:47.769
You know, today I will go…
I will go to Hanok Village,

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.896
And we gonna wear hanbok.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.481
And you never wear with me.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.442
So, I'm very happy I will go with girls.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.527
Ah…

00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.907
Trying hanbok is very embarrassing.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.661
Especially in front of so many people.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:09.749
If you love your girlfriend,
you can wear this one time.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.379
Other girls will come?

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.257
Yeah, we go together now.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.510
Going with girls sounds better

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.306
than go and wear hanbok, for me.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.641
- Okay.
- No?

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:28.268
Okay. Yeah.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:30.353
Bye-bye.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.604
Bye-bye. Tchau.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:32.522
Okay.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.573
Nothing like discomfort
to make us start moving.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:46.411
Girl, I woke up a little earlier today.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.746
Then I came downstairs.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.166
I sat here in the living room
thinking about yesterday.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:54.294
I had a lot of fun.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.088
I felt really comfortable.

00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:01.342
But at a certain point I realized
I wasn't paying attention to Jack.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.721
And I think he got a little upset.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.308
I mean, he came here to see me.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.561
I ended up
getting distracted by other things

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.355
and paying attention to other people.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.777
It's okay, but…

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.822
you could've been more honest.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:23.740
Yeah.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.368
Not just with him, but with yourself too,
you know? At that moment.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:31.414
You don't have to pay attention to him
just because he came here.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.332
Uh…

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:36.336
There's no right or wrong
in situations like that, but…

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.838
Just think a little like,

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:41.466
"Oh, would I like it
if someone did that to me?"

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.509
"If I were in his shoes,
would I feel comfortable?"

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.719
Right… Yeah.

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:47.764
And just continue your journey, you know?

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.975
But what do I want with Jack?

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:53.936
I think I know where this is going.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.440
I just need one more date to be sure.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.670
- Guys, I think it's over there.
- Where is it?

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.256
- Let's cross the street, it's right there.
- Is that the place?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.841
- Yeah.
- Oh, how pretty!

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.385
Come on.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.095
Oh my God. I'm so anxious.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.396
What a pretty place.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.772
Look at this storefront.

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:39.148
Oh, I love it.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.526
- Oh, it's so pretty here!
- Oh, my future kids!

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:42.777
Morena's got baby fever.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.071
- Girl, this one is your size.
- It is.

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:46.322
Mine and Luanny's.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:47.949
Hello!

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.880
So much fun!

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.137
Wow, we look so cute, seriously.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.847
- Stop!
- Look at this!

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.515
Come on!

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.809
- What if I trip?
- I'm coming out.

00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.727
I only want to walk around like this now.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.354
The Korean girl walking down the stairs.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.690
The little Korean girl. Come, Korean girl.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.066
Come.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:27.029
- Oh, I feel so cute!
- I feel so girly right now.

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:34.287
Hey, ladies,
let's not forget that people live here.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.830
- You can't be too loud.
- You're right.

00:07:35.913 --> 00:07:36.914
We have to speak softer.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.167
- It's true.
- We can't talk too much in this section.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.210
- For the whole street?
- The whole neighborhood.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.588
Did I want Su-woong to be here?

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.591
Yeah. But I'm loving doing this with them.

00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:48.885
And I think it's been
really good for Camila.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.515
Babe, how do you feel being back in Korea?

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.225
You came when you were three?

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.936
- I don't remember anything.
- You left when you were three, right?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.480
- I was three when I left.
- Right.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.317
Everything is very new and surreal to me.
I feel like a foreigner.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.403
- A foreigner?
- But I also feel at home.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.615
It's sort of a crazy mix of feelings.

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:13.242
I've always had
a mental block about coming here.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:19.540
Because… my mom abandoned me
when I was really young.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:23.294
And I didn't want to have
any memories of her.

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.795
I don't even have pictures.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.881
I-I don't know what her face looks like.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:29.300
I try to think it wasn't her fault.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.845
I think there's a lot behind it, you know?

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.806
But we can talk about this later.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.683
Okay. We have time.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:45.149
- Don't you cry!
- Oh my God!

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.569
It's fucking hard
to leave your comfort zone at first.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.030
It's uncomfortable, it hurts.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.573
But that's what happens with change.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:56.202
It starts with you
and it affects everyone around you.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:10.967
Oh my God!

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.051
I'm speechless!

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:19.976
Oh, you look so handsome! Wow!

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.107
Jeez! Nice hair!

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.443
Such a nice hair?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.195
Nice surprise!

00:09:32.613 --> 00:09:35.575
- Oh wow! You look so handsome! My God!
- Yeah?

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.952
- Queen Morena?
- Yeah.

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.746
- Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!
- She's so happy!

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.290
Kiss her! Kiss her!

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:44.625
- Kiss her! Kiss her!
- A peck! A little peck!

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.670
Beautiful!

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.381
Su-woong, you look really good with this.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.301
Why-why you never want to wear this?

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:56.887
Look at this handsome king. Oh my God!

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:01.767
Why don't we let them have
their moment alone and enjoy?

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:02.685
I think so.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:05.104
- Morena really wanted this.
- They deserve it.

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.314
So, girl.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:08.024
Enjoy it, okay?

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.109
Bye-bye!

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.405
- I'm very happy you came. Really.
- Mm?

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.201
So good with these clothes.
You should wear this more times.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.912
- Really.
- Queen? Yeah? Queen Morena?

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.372
Yeah. Queen Morena.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.084
No, but really.
So nice. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.170
- You're welcome.
- I'm very happy now.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.559
- It's such a really nice place.
- Very nice.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:47.063
I'm not sure about
walking with a hanbok, but…

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:50.232
No, with hanbok perfect!

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.902
To-to feel this atmosphere more.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:53.861
Yeah, sure.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.990
It takes courage to face new things.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.035
There's a first time
even for a Korean to wear a hanbok.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:10.044
And the unexpected can happen even when
something may seem completely predictable.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.251
- Hey, Katy.
- Hello!

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:51.168
How are you?

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.296
- How are you today? Good, yeah. Awesome.
- You look good. Pretty good.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.257
- What are you doing now?
- Um…

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.175
I was jump… jump-roping.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.927
- Warming up? Okay.
- Yeah, warming up, yeah.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.512
- Awesome.
- Do you want to do that?

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:04.014
Yes, for sure.
For sure. Wait, let me just…

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.224
take this off.

00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:06.142
Yeah.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.394
- And then we can start it.
- Oh, nice.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:11.188
This is his chance to loosen up,

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.649
because it's the only thing
we have in common.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.025
Make it count, Jack.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.236
And please don't let me down.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:21.490
- This one is yours?
- Boxing? Yes, red is mine.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.783
I'm gonna help you out.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.243
Perfect.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.455
Is it boxing today?

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.540
- It's boxing, right. Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.043
- Like this?
- It's not bad. Yeah, it's not bad.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.378
"It's not bad."

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.671
It's not bad.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.715
But your speed is
quite-quite good, actually.

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:39.133
Okay, good.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.094
Yeah, nice. Nice!

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:43.846
Nice.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.682
What about a body shot? Like that. Hm!

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.852
Not like that. Like… Hm!

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.480
Like this?
Because in Muay Thai we do like… Tch!

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.106
And, uh, you have to…

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.566
Here.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:57.067
You slip the punch.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.694
- You slip the punch.
- Ah.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.404
And then, um… Like…

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.031
- Boom.
- Boom.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.366
Okay. Like, you slip the punch and--

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.119
Ah, okay. Ah, okay. So you have to…

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.705
- Right, right, right.
- Now I got it. Okay.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.999
If I… If I hit like-like that… slip.

00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:13.000
And then I… Pssh.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.085
- Right, right. Exactly.
- Okay, now I got it.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:16.796
Whoa!

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.465
- Just…
- Okay, okay, yeah.

00:13:21.842 --> 00:13:22.676
Whoa!

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.513
I-I should not spar with you, actually.

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.975
Maybe not. I'll be- I'll beat your ass up.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.936
All right, yeah. Yeah, maybe.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.527
I know, I know.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:41.529
Do you want some water?

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.532
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Here you go.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.533
Thank you.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.081
I'm a little rusty.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.207
It's been a while…

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.000
- Right, I know.
- …since I last did that.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:55.918
I know.

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:57.461
But it was good.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.382
Yeah, you're a really-really good boxer,
actually.

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:03.509
- I know. I'm the best.
- Way better than me.

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.011
You can knock me out, actually.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.805
- I can what?
- You can knock me out.

00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:08.973
Oh, okay. Yes.

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:11.267
- You can knock me out.
- And then you faint.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.977
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:18.399
You're like morning person
more than… more than night?

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:21.986
No, I'm a night person.
I like going out at night, drinking.

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:27.700
Like… seriously? I've had
small talk more interesting than this.

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:31.078
That's why me and the girls,
we were a good match.

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:31.996
Good together, right?

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.083
Yes, because we kind of have,
like, the same energy.

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:39.211
We like having fun, we like talking,

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.672
everybody's passionate about

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.382
- what they're doing right now.
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:47.595
And everybody's, like,
crazy in that house. So, it's even better.

00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:48.762
Yeah.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:53.517
This type chit-chat
makes me very uncomfortable.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.436
It's like this isn't clicking.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.313
You're going to cook for us, right?

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.231
I don't know how to cook.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.150
- Really? You don't cook?
- Mm-mm.

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.818
- No, of course not. No.
- Really?

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:05.404
- Really? Oh.
- Yeah.

00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:06.947
"Cook for us"?

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.492
Don't hold your breath, darling,
'cause that's not gonna happen.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.202
What a huge mistake!

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.204
So, you were telling me
that you wanted to spar,

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.165
so maybe we can do it over here.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.000
- Okay. Yeah.
- Right?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.002
- Get the gloves. Get the gloves.
- You wanna bet?

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.838
- No, of course not. No.
- If you, um…

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.757
- If you hit me even once…
- Mm.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.508
Like, um…

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.468
I don't like betting.

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:29.428
- You're not betting? Really.
- No, no.

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.348
I always… I'm always betting.

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:40.022
Like, yeah. You can… You can hit me
wherever you want, actually.

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.149
Oh! Like that. Oh!

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.153
Y-you-you be careful, because I'm-I'm…

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:47.655
- skinny.
- I'm not gonna hit you.

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.406
- I'm not gonna hit you, okay?
- Okay.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.116
But I can… I can still fake.

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.536
Like-like-like that, okay?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.704
Don't do it.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.500
- Oh!
- Yay! I did it!

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.001
It's really good. It's really good.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.589
Yeah. Today's winner is Katy!

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:10.427
- Yay! Katy! Katy! Katy! Katy!
- Do you feel good?

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.848
See? I won.

00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:19.603
We have nothing in common.

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:23.065
I want a light and fun relationship.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:25.442
This is all so boring and bland.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.403
Is it time to say goodbye?

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:32.741
I had a lot of fun today. It was great,
because it's something that you like,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.160
- and also something that I like.
- Yeah.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:38.038
And we could find something
that we have in common.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.415
- Mm-hmm.
- Um…

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.168
But I feel like
we are good friends, right?

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.878
- Yeah, and…
- Yeah.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:48.465
…we are more like friends
than something more?

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.551
Oh, is that a question?

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.886
No, it's an affirmation.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.054
- An affirmation?
- Yeah.

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:58.308
- So I feel like we are better as friends…
- Mm-hmm.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.853
…than, uh, something more.

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:02.896
- Like, I really like you…
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.276
…but, um, I feel like
we don't have that chemistry,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.986
- like, for romance.
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.446
- Oh, okay.
- And stuff like that.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.697
Like, we are good friends.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.283
Like, we were already friends before…

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.910
- Mm-hmm.
- …like, when we were talking.

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.246
And, um…

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.792
I was here to see if it was
gonna develop into something else…

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.002
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- …or not.

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:28.255
And I really had an amazing time with you.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:29.298
Mm-hmm.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:33.010
And I want to be your friend.

00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:34.762
- Like, keep as friends. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.930
- Yeah, me too. Yeah.
- Yes? Awesome!

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:38.849
Give me a hug.

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:39.767
All right.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:41.643
- Yeah.
- Good!

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.146
- I appreciate that. Really. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:48.317
- Good to have a chance to talk about it.
- Like, you know… um… Yeah.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.110
- Thank you for everything.
- Yes.

00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.426
I'm sad for you.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.846
You know, you come to Korea, and then…

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.308
he just decides to leave
in front of everybody.

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:23.477
He kept arguing.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.355
Wow, that's just… There's no future there.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.190
It's fine, babe, it's the only way…

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.944
Before that happened,
like, I didn't have the strength…

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.947
to put an end to it.

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.282
I think I…

00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:40.369
How can I say this?

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.580
I put myself in unnecessary situations.

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:45.958
But is he nice to you?

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:49.086
He is nice, but he's weird. I don't know.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.879
He says I'm the weird one.

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:52.840
But it's a good thing.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.384
It was good.
Maybe if I'd stayed in Brazil,

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.971
if I hadn't come with you,
I wouldn't have realized this.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.933
So much was happening in front of me,
but I couldn't see clearly.

00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:04.685
Si-won is very immature.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.981
I'm afraid next time we talk
will be an endless relationship drama.

00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:13.110
I wonder what it's like
to be one of those normal couples.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:17.573
What's your plan for today?

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.158
- My plan?
- Yeah.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:20.701
We're going to do some shopping.

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.744
- Okay.
- And you know, like, in Korea…

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.788
Oh, that's the surprise?

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:25.789
We're going shopping?

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.792
Yeah, I mean,
Korea's full of shopping places, so…

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.710
Okay.

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:33.005
Like, in Korea,
people like to dress up, I guess…

00:19:33.088 --> 00:19:35.215
- Yeah?
- …a little similar.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:36.258
- And…
- Oh!

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:39.136
We're matching clothes,
buying matching clothes today?

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.013
- Really?
- Well, if you want to.

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:42.598
- But if you don't…
- I want to.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.601
Of course I want to buy matching clothes!

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.061
In Korea, that means like
a step towards going steady.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.354
Or am I delusional?

00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:01.533
- Here we are.
- It's here?

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:02.826
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Okay.

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:10.584
Simple stuff.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:12.169
- Simple stuff? Okay.
- Yeah.

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.296
- So, a black one.
- Let's do simple.

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:17.674
Let's see.
And what about your pants? Let's try…

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.593
Let's just try this.

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:20.886
So, like this.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.056
- Let's try it now.
- Yeah, let's try it.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:25.557
- Let's just try it.
- Okay, here.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.309
I'm going to take this too.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.644
Okay. let's go.

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:34.274
- This is the fitting room.
- This-This is the fitting room?

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.568
- Okay.
- Let's go in.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:37.694
Okay.

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:43.200
No!

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.212
What do we do when
what should be our comfort zone

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.506
is such an unknown place?

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.303
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.684
To Yangcheon, sir, please.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.561
Thank you.

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:21.863
It's very scary
going to find out what this place is.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:26.702
This fear has always been with me,
the fear of knowing where I came from,

00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:29.079
seeing the neighborhood where I was born.

00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:30.956
It's far away, isn't it?

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:33.250
- I thought it'd be closer to our house.
- Me too.

00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:38.880
My hands are sweating.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:39.798
No joke.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.258
Feel.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.096
I don't… My hands don't usually sweat.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.315
- Are we here?
- Yeah. Shall we?

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:57.357
Thank you.

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.868
- Is it here?
- I think so, babe.

00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.038
Wow, it's so different from where we were.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.254
Wow, it's so different. No joke.

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:28.638
What would my life
had been like if I had stayed here?

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:33.518
I would definitely be a different person.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.522
- I think it's that one over there.
- Know the number?

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:40.650
That's it.
That's the hospital where I was born.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.779
I used to feel so angry.

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.405
My father wasn't a good person.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.700
And I'll never really know
why my mom ran away.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:52.454
But what matters is that
I'm here today, in one piece.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:55.749
Do you think… Like, do you blame her?

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:57.542
For that?

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:58.752
No.

00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:03.757
I don't… I don't know exactly
how old she was when she had me.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:07.803
But I know she was in her thirties,
as old as I am today.

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:09.971
I mean…

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.308
she had a life before she had me.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:15.102
What if it happens?

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:19.564
I don't know, what if
she's looking for you and you meet again?

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:23.777
Would you be open to that or
would you rather go your separate ways?

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.987
I'd rather not.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:29.908
I'm 31. I've lived like this
for 31 years, I don't…

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.328
I don't think it would
change anything now.

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:35.330
Maybe if I were younger.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:40.669
It's fine,
my sister came here once looking for her.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:41.753
She didn't find her?

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:45.215
Mm, well, it seems like she didn't.

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:47.968
There was a moment when I was curious.

00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:51.972
But think about it, I don't… I don't even
know what her face looks like.

00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:52.931
How would I…

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:55.058
- You don't have any pictures or anything?
- No.

00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:59.020
Your family never showed you anything?

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:02.232
We used to have pictures,
but my stepmother tore them up.

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:16.288
All things considered, I think I grew up
a pretty normal person, didn't I?

00:24:17.873 --> 00:24:19.082
Don't you think?

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.334
I do. Actually,
I think you're really strong.

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:22.919
Yeah, babe.

00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:26.631
I know it's hard to say this,
but the person who…

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.385
left you behind is really stupid.

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.637
Because you're an amazing woman.

00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:34.097
You have a beautiful heart.

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:36.975
I think I'm happy in my little world.

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:42.397
Um… Where I live,
the things I've achieved…

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.610
I have a very strong group of friends.

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.404
I can't really complain, you know?

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.658
Like, not everyone knows.

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:59.956
I don't like to talk about these things,
because I don't like to show weakness.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.501
And to me, this is showing weakness.

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:06.505
I've always been very independent. I…

00:25:10.342 --> 00:25:12.719
But I don't think this is weakness.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:18.141
I think you're just letting out something
that you've kept inside for a long time.

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:20.936
And it's hard for you to talk about this.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:25.232
Babe, I think you're among the ones
who understand me the best, you know?

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:28.527
'Cause you're a mom,
I think you understand all this.

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.820
I've always tried to…

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:33.698
ignore my past.

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:36.034
But I think I did a good thing by…

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:38.912
putting an end to this.

00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:41.998
Maybe if you hadn't done this
and you'd gone back to Brazil,

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.458
you would have regretted it.

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.044
Now that I think about it, yeah.

00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:47.629
A lot.

00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:50.507
Are you more relieved?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.508
I am.

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:55.303
Thank you for coming with me.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.555
Anytime.

00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:57.847
My Barbie, thank you.

00:25:57.931 --> 00:25:58.848
Let's go.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:12.862
So do you feel more Korean or Brazilian?

00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:18.660
Girl, right now I feel more Brazilian. I…

00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:21.037
consider myself Brazilian.

00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:23.456
Especially after seeing the culture here.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.333
I've always wondered,

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.335
because I'd never been here.

00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:31.590
Now being here,
I've realized I am Brazilian

00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.133
through and through.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:37.012
Everything happens at the right time.

00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:42.392
Now I can leave my past behind
and finally move on.

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:05.290
- It looks really good on you.
- This is the best night ever

00:27:05.373 --> 00:27:06.541
since I arrived here.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:09.669
Like, the weather is so perfect today.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:12.088
That's it? That's why you like today?

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:14.591
No!

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:16.092
Because I'm with you too.

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:18.011
By the way, thank you for the clothes.

00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:20.555
But now we're at Jongno,

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.974
one of the famous places to…

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.852
- Oh!
- …actually drink.

00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:27.354
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:29.522
So, do you know a good place nearby?

00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:31.524
Uh, actually, yeah, just follow me.

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:32.984
Okay, I'll follow you.

00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:40.325
So, the place that
I told you about is here.

00:27:40.408 --> 00:27:42.619
- Okay.
- Let's go there.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:50.877
- Welcome to…
- It's so nice!

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.795
…his bar.

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.338
Ooh!

00:27:53.421 --> 00:27:56.216
Now I have a K-drama to call my own.

00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:58.259
Crash Landing on Love: Brazil.

00:28:03.973 --> 00:28:05.642
I love this place.

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.018
- You do?
- It's so nice here, yeah.

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:08.520
Cozy, yeah.

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:09.688
Yeah, it's especially cozy.

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:11.272
Yeah. It was so noisy.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:14.192
Like, everyone talking to each other.
So many people.

00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.528
- I couldn't concentrate.
- Yeah, I couldn't too.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.197
- But, I mean, it was still fun.
- Yeah.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.115
Please.

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:21.616
- No.
- Let me order.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.954
A Cosmopolitan and a gin and tonic,
please.

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:28.039
- A Cosmopolitan and a gin and tonic.
- Yes.

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:30.083
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:34.879
You remembered that
my favorite drink is Cosmopolitan.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:36.172
Yeah.

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.674
Oh, Danny.

00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:45.390
Aw, he remembered
what my favorite drink is!

00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:48.059
Seriously, how can he be so cute?

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.478
How do you say?

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.396
Sa…

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:52.856
- Saúde.
- Saúde.

00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:54.065
{\an8}Saúde.

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:55.775
Don't we have to look
at each other's eyes?

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:57.152
- Yeah. We do.
- Right. Okay.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:58.820
- Saúde.
- Saúde.

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.200
Today is our…

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:10.331
I mean, today is actually our first time
spending, like, the whole day…

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:11.875
- Yeah.
- …together.

00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:15.628
We actually didn't had
so many quality time together,

00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:17.505
ever since I arrived here.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.299
- Yeah.
- So being able to talk to you,

00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:22.177
and spend time with you,
and look at you, it's…

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.553
It's better.

00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:26.556
I… Yeah, because,
like, when we were talking online,

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:28.975
when we were texting each other?

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:32.312
Like, I couldn't even imagine how is…

00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:36.065
how it all was going to be like in person.

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:40.111
I don't really talk with strangers,
I would say.

00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:41.946
I'm serious.

00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:47.744
So, like, when you first popped up

00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:49.287
because you liked my post,

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:55.502
and then I went through your profile,
I was like, "Oh, who is this?"

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:56.586
"Who's this girl?"

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:58.463
Mm.

00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:00.048
And, I mean…

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.593
Fir… If you hadn't, I think…

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:08.181
sent me the voice message,
I don't think this…

00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:10.642
None of this would have happened,
to be honest.

00:30:10.725 --> 00:30:14.938
I haven't really…
talked deeply with someone…

00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:16.940
Western?

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:20.109
Yeah, a Western person.
Like, someone from the West, I guess.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.072
But yeah, actually, yeah,
you're the first person to, like,

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.325
actually talk this long and, like,

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.118
this deep.

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:32.789
So, you make me feel
very comfortable around you.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.877
Are you comfortable now?

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.420
Yes, I'm comfortable now.

00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:42.298
Is it allowed to hold…

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:45.635
- hands, or no?
- Yeah, it's allowed to hold hands.

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:46.803
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:30:47.887 --> 00:30:48.888
Okay.

00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:57.856
Like, yeah, I haven't been
on a date like this for so long.

00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:00.108
- To be honest. Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:02.235
- Yeah. Jinjja.
- Me either.

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:05.488
- Stop lying! Jinjja?
- I'm not lying.

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:09.284
I know that feeling and I…

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:13.872
I get very nervous about it,
because I also…

00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:16.165
uh,

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:20.879
haven't been in a moment
like this for a long time.

00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:35.351
Muito…

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.606
{\an8}- Muito… What was it?
- Mm?

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:41.232
I forgot.

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:43.318
- What do you mean?
- "So pretty."

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.111
- Pretty?
- Yes.

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:46.487
Bonita.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:47.822
Bonita.

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:48.990
Bonita.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.200
I thought I'd never feel like this again.

00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:54.662
I don't want to get too attached,
but it's hard.

00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:57.290
Does he feel the same way?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.377
I don't know about like the…

00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.880
So, in Korea, we say, "skinship."

00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:05.131
- Like…
- What is that?

00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:10.011
Like, uh… Like, you know,
like, hugging or holding hands. Like that.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.640
- Oh.
- Like, touch, stuff like that.

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.934
Oh, Brazil people are very touchy.

00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:17.727
Would you hold your hands
with a male friend?

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:18.770
A male friend, no.

00:32:18.853 --> 00:32:22.148
But, uh… we will hug each other
and we gonna like…

00:32:22.231 --> 00:32:23.608
- Mwah.
- Oh my--

00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:24.692
Kiss the cheek.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:26.569
Yeah, normally.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:28.655
Okay, so--

00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:30.949
Are you nervous because
I kissed your cheek? No--

00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:33.201
- No, I'm not nervous.
- Did I do something wrong?

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:35.411
No, no, no, no. Okay.

00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.580
No, it's because in Brazil, the…

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.290
Turn your… Turn your chair to me.

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:40.208
Okay.

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:45.672
Like, in Brazil, when you meet a person,
you're going to be like… Mwah.

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:48.091
- Sometimes… …two kisses.
- Oh my God.

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.592
- On the cheek.
- Really?

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:52.136
Really. And then you're going to hug.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.597
And you're not going to be like, Ooh."

00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.392
You're going to be like,
"Hi, how are you?"

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.102
We are very touchy…

00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.603
- Oh.
- …in Brazil.

00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:02.188
- For me…
- In Korea, we'd never do that.

00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.523
Yeah.

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:05.775
I mean, you just ppoppo me! Like--

00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:08.861
- Ah, ppoppo? What means ppoppo?
- Ppoppo means, like, kissing.

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:09.779
Kissing?

00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:11.864
- I "ppoppoed" you?
- Yeah.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.743
- Okay…
- Let me ppoppo you again.

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.869
- What?
- Come here.

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.287
- Ah!
- Mwah!

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:20.123
Yeah, that's normal in Brazil.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.416
Let's do it again, I guess.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.126
You liked it!

00:33:23.209 --> 00:33:25.044
Okay.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.963
Okay… Ah, okay, maybe I'm drunk.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.677
If he got that embarrassed
by a kiss on the cheek,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.221
how is he going to react
to a big kiss on the lips?

00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:38.725
I'm ready,
but I know it's different for Koreans.

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.269
And that's fine, I like how it's going.

00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:50.194
Is there something specific that you wanna
do with me the next time we go out?

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:52.613
Let's keep it a secret.

00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.783
Full of surprises is better, no?

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.868
Yeah.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:11.507
When I walked into the mall,

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:15.511
he said he was taking me there because
he wanted to buy us matching outfits.

00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.722
- You know? Like…
- That's so cute!

00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:20.433
I know a lot of people
think that's cheesy.

00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:22.560
- No, it's beautiful.
- But can I be honest?

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.604
That's never happened to me before.

00:34:24.687 --> 00:34:26.856
In Korea, that's a couples' thing.

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:29.150
- It's beautiful.
- People who are serious do that.

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.069
But we haven't talked about that at all.

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:33.738
Girl, I want to know how you're doing.

00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:35.239
What happened with Jack?

00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:36.324
Yeah, tell us.

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.700
Dr. Jack.

00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:40.036
I was talking to Camila,

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:42.955
and I realized that maybe that's

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.708
not what… We might not…

00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:50.129
be ready to have a real relationship

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.299
as… a couple.

00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:56.135
Like it or not,
we come from two very different cultures.

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:58.304
That's not the way I want to be treated.

00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:00.348
And it makes you think,

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.934
"I may be stopping him
from meeting the woman of his life

00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:04.519
and building his family."

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.938
So I was like, "Man, we have to be…"

00:35:10.149 --> 00:35:11.567
"Just friends."

00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.402
Don't cry. These things happen.

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:16.197
- They can happen.
- Girl, it's natural, like…

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.156
Yeah.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.284
- There's a lot of people in the world.
- How about we raise this energy,

00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:24.372
take advantage of the fact
that you look super hot, and go out?

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:25.414
Let's go out, girl.

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:28.626
Let's go so you'll stop crying.

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:29.627
Let's do it.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.420
Don't cry, your makeup looks so beautiful.

00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:33.131
- Yeah.
- Good point.

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:35.133
What do you want to do, girl?
It's your choice.

00:35:35.216 --> 00:35:37.468
- I want a little karaoke today?
- Yeah, let's do it!

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.554
- Let's go to karaoke.
- Let's sing our hearts out.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:41.514
- We'll have fun.
- Let's go, because singing

00:35:41.597 --> 00:35:43.850
- makes you feel better, right?
- Exactly.

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:46.519
- Shall we? Let's go.
- -Let's go.

00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:48.187
Seriously, I really wanna go.

00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:49.522
- We're going.
- For real.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.078
Girl!

00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:07.498
- Oh, what?
- Get ready, 'cause we're going to karaoke.

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.792
- Are you guys going now?
- Yeah. Shall we?

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.794
- I don't wanna go.
- Why?

00:36:11.878 --> 00:36:13.880
Because Si-won is coming here to talk.

00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:17.508
What does he have to talk to you about
after the scene he caused?

00:36:19.343 --> 00:36:20.344
Come on.

00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:22.096
What are you writing there?

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.057
The things I've been through with him.

00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:27.226
I've been writing for two days now.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.811
- Two days?
- Mm-hmm.

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:31.814
Oh, so that's what you were writing
last night when you were so quiet,

00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:33.774
and I was thinking, "What is she writing?"

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.735
What time is he coming? Soon?

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.070
Around 9:30.

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:41.407
You should come with us to have some fun.

00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:43.451
I'm not in the mood, girl.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.286
I'll go with you next time.

00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:47.747
I don't know, my head is just…

00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:51.792
It's spinning,
and I don't know what to do. I don't know.

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:56.047
Oh God. It's hard, you know?
Because we've been together for a while…

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.549
- You like him, that's the worst part.
- I do like him.

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:02.470
You come to Korea to fix things
with him and you didn't fix anything.

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:03.846
Wow. Nothing.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.558
And from what I've seen, he's always
criticizing Brazilian women, right?

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:08.976
Their temper and all that,

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.020
but he never says anything
about Korean men.

00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:13.814
- He says that… He says I…
- They're perfect.

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.650
…take things to extremes, you know?

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:18.819
But it's not like that,
'cause he has said things that hurt me.

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.697
Put things on the list,

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:25.868
think about whether
it's worth it or not, really.

00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:28.788
Stop wasting your time.
Really make a decision, you know?

00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:32.166
None of your dates end well,
it's always tense.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:37.004
The one thing that makes me doubt is
that we've had so many good moments.

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.840
He's romantic.

00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:44.595
- He's kind.
- He has such a cute smile, doesn't he?

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:48.266
Yeah, it was. Seriously, his smile is
what made me fall in love with him.

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:49.725
Such a hard situation.

00:37:50.643 --> 00:37:53.062
That's it, girl, we're going out now.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.316
Think about your life,
and I wish you good luck.

00:37:57.858 --> 00:38:00.569
I really hope you can figure things out.

00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:03.364
Enjoy your evening and the party.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.136
Let's go.

00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:26.220
Yeah!

00:38:40.192 --> 00:38:41.402
I'm confused.

00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:44.739
I don't know whether to listen
to my mind or my heart.

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.949
I don't know what makes sense anymore.

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:16.145
You can sit here.

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:24.070
I think it's more better for talk.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:33.454
Are you okay?

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:37.958
No.

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.006
I'm not okay. Let's get to the point.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.592
I need to say something to you.

00:39:46.675 --> 00:39:48.094
But before I do,

00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:50.513
I'd like to know…

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:54.433
what…

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.436
you have to say to me.

00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.107
I want to know how you feel about this.

00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:09.698
I feel like we're wasting a lot of time.

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:13.994
We make a lot of promises
and we don't keep any of them.

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:18.207
I feel like you're not
being serious about me.

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.711
I feel like you run away
when I wanna talk,

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:24.505
you run away from…

00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:27.842
the problems we need to figure out.

00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:30.302
I see…

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.806
a lot of childish behavior.

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:36.142
And…

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:38.644
I need a man who's mature.

00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:43.816
One who really shows that
he wants me around.

00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:48.404
Look, first of all…

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:53.868
I sort of understand what you're saying.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.619
But I've gotta be…

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:00.583
very honest with you.

00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:07.423
From…

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:10.509
the moment we first met…

00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:15.681
you started talking about
aspects of my private life.

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.268
When you said all those things,

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.313
do you have any idea
how that made me feel?

00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:25.232
No.

00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:28.527
I felt embarrassed,
I got really mad at you.

00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:33.991
And, to be honest,
I'm still pretty upset about that.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.287
Ever since you got to Korea…

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:44.710
I've been trying to make you feel good.

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.881
But you stress me out every day.

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:53.511
How come you're upset?

00:41:54.553 --> 00:41:57.389
I'm the one who should be upset.

00:41:58.557 --> 00:41:59.517
I stressed you out?

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.811
You cheated on me, you know that?

00:42:02.895 --> 00:42:05.022
Remember? Remember your friend?

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.441
The Turkish girl? Remember?
