WEBVTT

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.342
Passengers of flight
three-three-two-one to Seoul--

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.093
Wow…

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:12.345
- The camera is catching my butt, for sure.
- Please find your seats, and fasten

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.848
- your seatbelts, and enjoy the ride.
- Oh, those are comfy, right?

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.766
- Hey, time for My Korean Boyfriend!
- Oh, no way, wow!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.809
All good?

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.185
Hey, how are you?

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.562
Oh, no shoes inside a Korean house.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.605
- Please…
- But the difference is that

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.399
there's no fiction here, okay?

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.692
You said it, girl!

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.112
- Stop being crazy.
- I would be her friend.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.613
Oh, beautiful!

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.452
- Oh, wow! Don't do that!
- You felt the Korean flavor.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.161
Oh, slay!

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:37.787
I can't believe it.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:38.621
- Okay.
- That was beautiful!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.748
Do you like K-dramas?

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.709
I think they're dope,
I love the Korean universe in general.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.836
- I'm already in love.
- By the way, I want to ask you, have

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.755
you ever gone too far to chase a man?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.258
- Who hasn't, right?
- Who hasn't, honey? I'd go to Mars.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.470
{\an8}- If I fall in love--
- Exactly. But if I'm not in love, I won't

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.514
{\an8}even travel to the nearest neighborhood to
see them.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.475
Yeah. But if he's
good, you can keep going--

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.268
{\an8}- He has to be good.
- Then we go to Mars honey, we go far away.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.103
{\an8}Like those girls, who
ended up all the way in Korea.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.438
{\an8}I'm shook!

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.982
The thing is, I always root for couples.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.527
{\an8}- I'm super excited. You are?
- Me too.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.781
{\an8}- I am, ready to talk a lot.
- Would I make a good Korean boyfriend?

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.909
- Yeah? Oh. Have you ever dated a Korean?
- I think so. Yeah.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.368
No, have you? Have you?

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:18.828
A Korean woman.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.496
No.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:20.955
- Never?
- Never.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.626
It must be an experience,
right? We'll see soon enough.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:25.418
Yeah.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.421
- Let's do this!
- I'm ready.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:29.422
- Seoul?
- It's far.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.299
My skin-care routine is all Korean.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:32.717
So is mine.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.639
Boarding has now begun for the
My Korean Boyfriend experiment.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:41.559
Oh, slay! Wow, will she let us
experiment with her boyfriend?

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.561
It's starting, Nicole!

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.730
- No, that girl--
- Bring us two!

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.609
- Yeah…
- These are the girls, aren't they?

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.945
Oh, poor girl.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.072
Whoa…

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.366
That's the kind of thing you should tell.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.408
It takes courage.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.163
Yeah. I don't even have the guts to leave
my neighborhood to go on a date.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.125
- Oh, they were already together.
- Check out the looks, they're so pretty.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.417
Oh, I wish I were them in Korea.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.462
{\an8}If their wish comes true,
I'm going to go over there.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.296
{\an8}Me too.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.091
{\an8}He didn't pick up. Been there, done that.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.217
Oh my God…

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:15.885
I'm already nervous.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.928
- Wanna stop?
- Check out the look.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:17.846
Oops.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.349
Each situation is worse than the next,
they're all awful.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:25.186
All K-dramas start like this, okay? They
all start badly, then-- This wall, okay?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.062
- Yeah.
- They start well,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.730
then get worse, then get better?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.274
Yeah.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:32.694
Imagine crossing the world,
then calling and not being answered.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:33.736
I don't want to look like a fool but,
damn.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.990
I came from the other side of he
planet and then he dissapeared.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.200
She doesn't know if he's real.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.829
I think my biggest fear would be the
person not being real. Like, being

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:44.038
- catfished.
- Dear Lord--

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:44.914
He ghosted her.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:45.832
He hasn't answered her.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.834
I already don't like Mari's man.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:51.921
Man, they talked for a month and a half,
then the guy messaged her a bunch, and she

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.800
thought they would meet and he'd be
the ideal man. Come on. And she--

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.802
She was ready to get married.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.346
And now for the million-dollar
question: are we going to live an actual

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.973
- K-drama here?
- We have to gossip.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.224
She's gonna get screwed.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.728
I borrowed money from my
friend so I could travel.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:07.687
My God…

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.732
How long have we known each other?
I can ask you for money, right?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:14.527
Apparently not. They don't have Venmo.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.738
- And she doesn't even have to go.
- What is she doing there?

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.698
She nearly ruined her
credit to go meet him.

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.742
For this Korean guy. These girls
are in too deep with these men.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.493
You don't have to be
psychic to know that.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.621
She's so naive. You
don't have to be a psychic.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.586
He looks like a walking therapy bill.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.421
At least he exists.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.092
What's that? Is he proposing?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.428
Is that a ring box?

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.221
Is he proposing?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:42.472
Oh my God!

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.142
In Brazil, this would be crazy.
Proposing that quickly?

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.479
Only my brother and Virgínia.
I've never seen this before.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.772
Let's see what happens.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:51.856
Let's see.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.066
Already?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.484
No way! How come?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.364
Oh my God, are those hearing aids?

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.574
Is it a flash drive?
Oh, they're headphones.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.078
- Headphones?
- He may be weird but he's cute.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.038
Headphones?

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:08.498
Ohhhhh…

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:12.919
Is he planting a bug on her?
Look at me, all traumatized.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:13.586
Oh, come on.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.713
That's so cute, it's got
translator technology--

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.257
That's what's missing in
Brazil, you know?Initiative.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.716
Baby, we're missing so many things…

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.804
- Oh, come on…
- Hey, worst prank ever, man.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:26.557
But they say Korean men are really
charming, they treat women like queens.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.475
Yeah?

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:32.855
- Oh, he's already touching her, look!
- See, he's already touching

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.107
her, huh? This guy is forward.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.945
Whoa, what the heck?
He's petting her? He's doing it like this.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.740
- I love a man like that, who takes charge.
- Yeah. See, when you least

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.158
expect it, love shows up.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.120
I'm not expecting anything,
okay? Do you have one for me?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.622
Well, at least he's honest.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.832
He's shameless.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.547
Ooh, "Jack."

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:01.676
She's going on a date!

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.392
Man, he's handsome.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.603
- Oh, he's so cute.
- I like him.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.689
- He's hot.
- Handsome, very handsome.

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:16.983
His hair is parted,
just the way she wanted.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.235
- Oh, very princely.
- Very princely.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.280
- Oh, he's gorgeous.
- Look at those eyebrows, perfectly styled.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.950
She's trying to steal her friend's man!

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.122
He's got a sweet face. But is he really?

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.125
- His clothes… he's well-dressed.
- Look, how cute.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:35.668
He's wearing a suit.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.046
- The other girls want him now.
- They're all excited.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.005
Vultures.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.341
- Gossips!
- So good.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.968
And the other girls are all jealous…
Look, look.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.179
How tall is he? Like, five nine?

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.224
He looks six feet to me. And one
seventy five. And he's a Sagittarius.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:50.933
What?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.518
They need chemistry, though.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.978
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.481
Do you think they like Brazilian
food? Some nice beans, cracklings--

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.774
Yes, honey. Who wouldn't?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.986
You think they can resist a
nice feijoada? You're so funny.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.614
- I'd cook for the boys right away.
- That's how you--

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.866
Cause then they'd get
attached to Brazilian food.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.786
Honey, right away. They can't find our
seasoning anywhere else. Bitch, I can't

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.704
- cook, what do I do?
- They'd love it--

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.664
- Really, bestie? I'll teach you.
- It's a low blow, right, I'd have

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.000
to…I'm not going to say what I'd do
instead.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.587
- It's like he's got a character limit--
- He--

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.466
What else?

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.219
- Yeah, we talked a lot, but--
- We do.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.138
Yeah, he's not going to-- This isn't going
anywhere, the guy is a systematic,

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:29.847
army man.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.017
Cat, cat. I have cat allergy.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.395
- Oh, really?
- I'm a cat person.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.438
- Oh, I like dogs better.
- Oh, I like both, but--

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.231
Yikes, this is bad.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:42.568
Imagine if your boyfriend didn't like
animals. You have a huge farm. I'm gagged.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.446
Oh, no. It would be a damn mess. I
wouldn't trade my animals for some guy.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.157
You'd have to be crazy. You have so
many. Goats, chickens, everything.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:48.950
I think--

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.660
Or maybe,
he would get used to it little by little,

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:51.411
right?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.329
Wouldn't you get rid of some of them?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.791
No, there's plenty of men out there. My
animals are mine. God forbid. My little

00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.960
- animals. I only have one of each.
- Yeah?

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:01.045
- I'm a party girl.
- Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Yeah.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.964
Because I like going out and drinking.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.173
I would be her friend.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.093
See?

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.720
- There's the conflict!
- He doesn't like going out.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.639
Oh, man. They have
nothing in common, my God.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:12.849
Oh, no.

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:14.976
She's slowly withering, the poor thing.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.314
But then,
the guys that are so straight-laced

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.442
are the ones you want the most, you know?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.652
- Speak for yourself.
- To lead him astray.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.779
- Oh, to corrupt him.
- You know? Yeah.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.282
You're family doesn't
know I have a daughter.

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:33.119
Tension.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.203
Oh, honey!

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.541
- Oh, damn!
- Thirty-five years old?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.087
Thirty-five?
With that skin? Oh, I want to go to Korea.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:46.924
Oh, an old man… just kidding…

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:49.302
Well, he's experienced, right?

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.678
I don't trust that smile.

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:53.890
If we stay together,
I'm not going to hide anything from you.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:01.772
Girl, that man is a liar.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.692
Yeah, he looks like a scoundrel.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.779
He makes a lot of bad investments and
that makes things really hard for us.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.865
Oh, so he's a big spender, is that it?

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:11.908
- Do you trust him?
- No.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:12.825
No.

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:14.118
No.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.163
I mean,
what's he spending money on? Headphones.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.832
- The headphones are going to win her over.
- But since it started translating,

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.335
she's only gotten more stressed out.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.963
Do you see any positives?

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.007
- I haven't seen any.
- Neither have I.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.050
There's a quote that I
think suits you guys,

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:29.675
it goes like this: "I'm not perfect,

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.553
but flowers grow even between
the cracks of the stones."

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:36.641
Wow--

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.019
She came like-- She
really-- She turned it around.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:40.811
Wow--

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.898
When I don't know what to say,
I just start dropping quotes,

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.857
you know? Like--

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.526
- My God!
- Even stone wears away

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.902
under constant dripping.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.739
You have to wear properly to meet my mom.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:09:00.289
- Yeah, I know.
- What? Oh, come on! Wow, man!

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.750
Did I hear that correctly?

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.879
Wow… I can't deal with that guy. No
Korean man is going to tell me how to

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.798
- dress.
- No, I'm already annoyed. No. No.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.716
Now I'm pissed off.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.677
- Oh, I don't like that boy.
- That man got on my nerves.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.972
I can't believe they're all
going to annoy me. No!

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.349
That's a guy who wants to marry his mom.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.476
Do I even want to meet your mom?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.936
Stay with your mom, then.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.231
Look at him.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:27.608
- Look. She touched him.
- I think he's cute.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.987
He's in love. A kiss?!

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.866
He's very different.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.826
On their first--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.161
He just said, "let's"?

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.289
- Oh, wow.
- She got a taste of Korea!

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.165
- Did they kiss?
- They did!

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.586
This is crazy,
the internet is no-mans land.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.464
What now?

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.301
- She's gorgeous, isn't she?
- Wow, the hair.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.261
- Are those extensions?
- Definitely.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.430
Is she being exalted now?

00:09:57.513 --> 00:10:00.933
He does have his flaws. He said he was
going to pick her up at the airport when

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.060
- she arrived from Brazil, but he didn't--
- Yeah.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.479
- That's awful. That was too-
- I think that's awful.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.356
I'm anxious.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.650
- Oh, my God.
- Turn around in slow motion.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.359
Wow.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.069
He showed up!

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.447
And we were judging him!

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.366
She had to go down all those steps?
Oh, how tiresome.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.665
How can she turn around with such
a big smile after he stood her up?

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.334
- But he's handsome.
- Guys, he's gorgeous.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.170
- I'd be furious.
- No, no. He could have his reasons. You--

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:30.671
You guys are all idiots!

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.173
Look- no. Something could have
happened. An accident, you know, on the

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:33.507
- day.
- No, but he's there now.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.759
His phone could have died.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.552
Unless he lost both hands in the
accident, he could have answered.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.804
His phone could have died. He was mugged.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.266
- I came here to surprise-- woah woah!
- Oh, she's head over heels.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.101
Yeah, Mari is totally in love.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.648
He left me waiting at the airport
and thinks a flower will fix it?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.067
It's from my heart, that's why.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.780
- A single rose?
- No, then he shows up,

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:57.239
- gives her a rose, and like--
- Guys!

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.157
Guys!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.994
He probably looked better
on Instagram than in person.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.287
You think so?

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.580
You know when you
start acting really silly?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.414
Yeah--

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.794
Like, he says something,
and she's like, "Oh, stop! Stop it!"

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.005
I was waiting here by myself
and I really thought no one was coming.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.716
No, of course I was going to come.
Because you came to Korea to see me.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.717
I hope, right?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.723
- They take so long to kiss, right?
- They do, I would have kissed him already.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.600
If he were Brazilian…

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.727
She was dying to kiss him, you know?

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.646
- Can't she? Man, take it easy?
- But let's take it slow.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:30.272
Things are different here in Korea.

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.109
- Yeah, it's different there.
- Oh, okay, fine.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:35.695
- I'm worried of touching you.
- No, no.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.322
Come on, give him a little kiss.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.617
- What a stiff hug.
- Honey, he left her hanging.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.412
That's how I hug my uncles. She's
respecting his time too, you know? Because

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.206
if we were to act like we do
here in Brazil, they get scared.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:50.167
Yeah, if she… yeah. They run
away, right? They would, right?

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.420
Even I get a little scared sometimes.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.136
This girl needs to see a therapist.
She's not ready for a boyfriend.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.053
Oh, my God.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:03.472
He treats me like a princess.
He doesn't insult me,

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.724
he doesn't humiliate me.

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.270
"How's your girlfriend?" "Good,
she didn't insult me today."

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:10.271
"She didn't insult me."

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:14.400
Oh, my God, poor thing,
she's used to toxic people.

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:15.192
Oh, my God!

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:21.157
- Can you help me translate this?
- Is everything okay?

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:22.783
Oh, my God.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.078
Luanny,
the day we meet again I want to tell

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.747
you confess something you didn't know.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.335
- What could it be?
- He was engaged? He lived with someone?

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.170
I thought so too.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.297
My God, what could it be?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.967
I think he's going to tell her that he's
actually fifteen, not thirty-five.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.093
With that skin… no doubt!

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:43.429
He's going to propose to me.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.765
Oh, she's so naïve, the poor thing.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.559
Eat very carefully maybe
the ring be in there.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.978
Guys, that's not how it works.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.898
She thinks the ring is in the lettuce!

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:56.650
- No way, guys.
- No, man.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.450
It's a gift card from a
store he likes, you know?

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.409
A gift card.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.411
I'm expecting too much.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:09.288
Come on!

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.709
Look how beautiful it is behind them,
Nicole!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.253
Is the proposal coming?

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:25.846
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, that's wonderful! The best couple.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.097
Nice. Nice.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:29.642
- That's great!
- She's gonna hurt her knee!

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.352
Oh, that's goals.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.604
- Aw, that was cute, man.
- I thought it was

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:34.814
cute, it was really sweet.

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:38.859
She threw herself at him,
she's got snot in her nose and everything!

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.530
- The trip is already worth it.
- It was so worth it, she came

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.448
- back with a husband as a souvenir.
- Yeah.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.617
Her friend is going to
lose it back at the house.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.744
She will, she'll be
very envious for sure.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.871
Definitely,
and soon they'll be in a fight.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.999
- I need to confess.
- He's going to confess.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:54.875
Yeah.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.752
- Oh, dear…
- My God.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.254
What do you guys think it is?

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.297
- Oh, I don't even wanna look.
- My God in heaven!

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.550
You didn't cheat right?

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.219
You didn't cheat,
did you? Oh, you were arrested? Oh, okay.

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.471
She's Brazilian, she's straight-forward.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.265
- He's so shameless.
- If he lies to his mother, you think he

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.058
- wouldn't lie to that Brazilian blonde?
- Right! He lied to his mother,

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.518
said he's the one who paid for the trip.

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:15.813
I already have a daughter,
I can't take care of a grown man too.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:16.897
Exactly.

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:19.066
- Look, look at the difference.
- Oh, man--

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:19.859
Yeah.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.778
The inequality here. First, a proposal at
a fancy restaurant-- They're not even in

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.406
a nice place, he's telling her
about his trauma on the street.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.408
There's no comparison,
right, Gabi? On foot!

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:30.369
Just- just end it-
just end it all, right?

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:31.579
- On foot!
- Manchild.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:33.831
I'm gonna grab some candy.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.625
Go ahead. Grab some for us.

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:39.545
I've never had Korean candy.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.714
Me neither. Damn it, it won't open.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.013
Oh my God, man.

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:52.182
What is this thing?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.192
It gets sweeter later.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.110
When?

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.695
Just give it a few sucks.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:06.655
It will get sweet, you'll see.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.838
- No way, he sat away from her?
- He sat on the other

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.298
side-- He sat next to--

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.467
- What the hell, man?
- What are you doing?

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.510
I told you, it's because of the cats.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.721
But hitting on her in
front of the dude is dirty.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.931
Look at him, he's just staring.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.849
I think their ring is very ugly.

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.479
Wow, what a jerk!

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.607
Honey, you can't even buy candy!

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.233
And he's criticizing the
ring, that's so trashy!

00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.526
He's criticizing someone else's ring!

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.572
- Oh, the fights are already starting.
- Did you feel the vibe shift? When he

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.908
got there, I feel like the vibe just died,

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.369
- the whole place.
- He doesn't know when to shut

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.788
- Wow, she- hey, she does not give in.
- up, he doesn't know when to talk--

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.214
I think Brazilian girls have
strange personalities.

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:08.509
Strange?

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.180
Man, who is this guy?

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.601
- For God's sake.
- I've never met a guy like

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.103
- that, man…He's impossible.
- Jesus Christ.

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.646
- This guy…
- Yeah, he's something else.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.647
Goddamn--

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:26.110
- Girl, that guy is so annoying.
- She said it! Camila said

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.194
what we're all thinking.

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.155
- So fucking annoying, that's right.
- She said it.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.658
- I want to go there and shake her.
- Me too.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.618
Can't she just like, find another guy?

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.203
Poor thing.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:39.873
It's a temple, right?

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:42.459
- Look, how beautiful!
- "Boochon Hakon"? Is that it?

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:48.382
Don't try, babe. Don't even try,
Nicole. Just leave it, okay?

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:01.061
- Oh, it's her man, that's amazing!
- I'm gagged! This man

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.438
is full of surprises.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.024
- Look, they have matching outfits!
- So sweet!

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:08.068
- He's scoring a lot of points.
- Guys, he's so cool.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:09.945
- I'm already in love with him.
- We didn't think it would work,

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.697
- but it's turning out to be perfect.
- Yeah, I'm already in

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.741
- love with this couple.
- Oh, how beautiful!

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.826
Yeah, they really, like, they stand out,
right? This couple is working.They are--

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:18.704
- They're working.
- He acts with love.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.873
It's the first episode and they're
already engaged, they're doing great.

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:23.167
And it seems like they don't
have financial problems, right?

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.585
- Everything is fine.
- Everything's good. And

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:25.627
he'll come to Brazil.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.963
- If you're about to cry--
- Girl, just grab a tissue.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:28.922
Grab a tissue.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.216
Thanks. I think you grabbed it wrong…

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.221
You're supposed to
pull it here. Oh, dear.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:37.931
Good thing I didn't cry.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.937
She's going to fall in love,
and he's going to be jumping.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.980
Oh, she will.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:45.898
Look at his size.

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.777
- He's so fit, what a stud!
- Look at his arms!

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.736
Oh wow!

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.906
- Girl, he's a Korean dreamboat.
- I want one like that! Nicole!

00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:58.327
- Take me there, look at those legs!
- Wow, look at him working out, whoa!

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.871
It's a different kind of date,
right? Taking her to work out.

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:02.456
Look, let him--

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.541
Oh, that's clever.
They're gonna work out and…

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.752
I they don't have anything to
talk about, they can just jump rope.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.880
- To break the ice, you know?
- Yeah, they'll have an activity.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:14.426
Are you like a morning person,
or more than- more than night?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:17.721
No, I'm a night person.
I like going out at night, drinking.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:22.059
This girl must be going crazy, she
can't get a kiss! She must be delirious.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:23.102
Yeah- yeah- oh! Wow--

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.938
I'm in agony here! Just
the two of them there--

00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.815
- She must be feverish by now.
- Wow, she doesn't touch him, she

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.150
- doesn't do anything, and he's all ripped.
- Wow, and- wow…

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.277
He has the charisma of a doorknob, right?

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:34.363
- Totally.
- He doesn't laugh at anything.

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.156
- They're polar opposites.
- Well--

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.991
I think it's more of a
friendship than a relationship, huh?

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:38.784
Weird.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.203
So far,
they have absolutely nothing in common.

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.788
Yes, they do. They both breathe.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:48.377
It's not like there's a huge problem or
something, like, wow!-- But they're just

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.837
- too different, you know?
- Yeah.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.964
They don't have a…
yeah, they don't have a very

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:53.757
strong connection, right?

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.634
- Too different.
- I wouldn't even be his friend. So meh.

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.636
- He has nothing to talk about.
- He's so bland, he

00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:58.762
doesn't even know how to talk.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:18:59.763
He doesn't talk.

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:01.014
I'd rather talk to a wall.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.559
I want to be your friend,
like, keep as friends.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.438
Another one that didn't work out.

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:11.733
Yeah, but at least it was sort of
clear, right? It was an end, like, she was

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.777
- clear--
- She was clear, she was. They have nothing

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.737
in common. -Also, he didn't make anything
up.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.781
She's a night person, he's a day person.

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:22.161
Yeah, and he didn't make up any excuses.
I think they're just not very compatible.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.746
He was okay with it, that
they're better off as friends.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.541
- Not at all. The--
- They're too different.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.672
- Welcome to--
- Wow, it's so nice.

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:34.882
This bar.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.594
{\an8}Now I have a K-drama to call my own.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.221
She's living it, isn't she?
She's living in her own show.

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.556
She's living in her own K-drama.

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:43.265
She's living it.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:47.060
- Is it allowed to hold--?
- It's allowed to hold hands.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.020
Your hand.

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.229
What's this?

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:53.317
I'm shaking.
I'm getting anxious. I'm sweating, look.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.109
Damn!

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.196
- Girl, Koreans are so respectful!
- So cute!

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.198
Wow, if we took this guy to a funk party,
he would die.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.115
Wow!

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:05.871
But she's looking so smitten. Like, "dude,
just kiss me already!" Take some action!

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.040
But he's also kind of smitten.

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:12.544
The pace really is different there, isn't
it?Look at that, how cute, he asked if he

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:16.882
could hold her hand, and here people are
like, "so, do you spit or swallow?" You

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:18.258
- know?
- Oh my God, dude!

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.719
- They're so polite.
- They are. It's one of the things that I

00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:23.013
admire the most about them, about their
culture. I think so too.

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.640
That's great,
isn't it? It's quite charming.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:28.602
Here, we rush things… and then,
there's nothing left to happen. Here, it's

00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:30.729
- a process.
- And then there's no- yeah.

00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:32.606
They prolong the process of passion,
right?

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:34.816
Yeah, you take it slow, you talk… It
becomes more intense and long-lasting.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.779
Now let me ask you a question. Today
they held hands. To kiss, it'll take two

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.572
months. What if the kiss is bad?

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.908
Then you find a way, you do other things.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.202
Do you think they'll kiss now?

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:46.703
Could it happen?

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.622
No, no. It's only the second date.

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:51.124
We hug each other and we go like--

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.253
- kiss the cheek.
- What?

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:55.587
Called it!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.840
- Guys, she's already jumping on him.
- I don't think he liked it.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.092
He pulled away.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.468
- Wow, girl!
- Never got to do that.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:04.137
- On the cheek, on the mouth--
- Hey, watch it. Easy there.

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.722
Take it easy.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.475
He was shocked when she
kissed him on the cheek.

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:10.769
He was super shocked.
Imagine when they go to bed.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.063
My God. Imagine if he came to Brazil as a
tourist. Like, "hey, how are you? " He'll

00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:15.983
get kissed on the cheek, like,
fifteen times and he'll go crazy.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.568
- Fifteen little kisses.
- They'll put their hand around his waist.

00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.070
That's right.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.614
In Korea, it's not very common to,
like-- No, not just kissing. But like, out

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:26.034
of the blue-- kissing on the cheek like
that on the second date, you know? So, it

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.995
- kind of startles them.
- Kissing? Hugging too.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.455
- He's so embarrassed!
- You're not going to be like-- You're

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.332
going to be like, "hi, how are you?"

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:37.379
{\an8}- Yea that's normal in brazil.
- Let's do it again, I guess.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:40.215
- Mr. Korean liked it!
- He's a fast learner!

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.134
He likes it, you guys!

00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:43.885
- Mr. Korean likes it!
- Dirty boy!

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:45.470
Look, he likes it.

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.181
- He's a cutie--"Oh, stop it!"
- He's like, "stop with

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.182
these sexy games! Stop!"

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:51.393
Ppoppo!

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.061
Not cool, not cool!

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:53.895
She's asking for it.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.232
He's loosening up a little bit.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.402
How is he going to react to a big
kiss on the lips? I'm ready.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.655
- That came out wrong.
- Saying--

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.949
Imagine a butt on his mouth!

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:08.994
- Girl, imagine--
- I thought he was using

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:10.454
slang for "booty", like "butt.

00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:13.540
Hey, let's take it easy,
Nicole. This is not that kind of show.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:14.333
Ppoppo.

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.585
Is there something specific you
want to do the nest time we go out?

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.253
She already wants to
move on to the next phase!

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:19.171
Yeah!

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.048
What would it be? Is
she wearing her lingerie?

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:22.841
Yeah. Imagine, wearing new
panties and never getting to use them.

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:23.759
Never!

00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.511
- We're back to- to Luanny.
- Luanny.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.221
{\an8}Poor thing.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:31.641
She's making a list of the pros and cons.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.812
- Is he? Is he, though?
- Romantic?

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:39.649
Oh, guys, she's delusional.
Aw, I feel sorry for her.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.735
Just grab your purse and
go out with your friends!

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:44.321
You're going to drink some
soju and sing some karaoke, girl.

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:46.114
Girl, for God's sake, stop being crazy.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.617
She went and fell in
love with the wrong person.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.618
Girl, honestly--

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.120
- I've been there.
- Yeah, who hasn't, am I right?

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.123
But when I feel like it's over, I
end it, I don't keep dragging it out.

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:55.916
Yeah.

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:58.543
- I want to hear what his excuse is today.
- She has to be straight with him.

00:22:58.627 --> 00:22:59.961
Don't keep dragging it out, you know?

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:03.173
He should be wearing, like-- He didn't
even say hi, he just went in, didn't even

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:05.050
- kiss her, right--
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:07.094
- He didn't even look her in the eye.
- Just--

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.095
- Arms like this --
- Look, look.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:10.639
- Oh, he's mad.
- He didn't even say hi to

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.058
- her. Oh, you mad, baby?
- Seriously, guys…

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.644
Now is the time for her
to break up with him.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:19.940
These girls are around twenty-seven,
twenty-eight years old, In astrology,

00:23:20.023 --> 00:23:23.985
there's something called the Saturn
return. When you're around that age,

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.321
you're suddenly dying to get married.

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.156
And when does Saturn leave?

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.034
- At twenty-seven or eight, Saturn leaves--
- And what about the return?

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:33.328
No, it starts and
returns between those ages.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.372
Oh, then I guess I'm twenty-eight.

00:23:35.455 --> 00:23:36.456
- You are?
- Yes.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.333
Why, are you--?

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.837
Dying to get married.
I must be about twenty-eight years old.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.758
Your Saturn must be really --Either that,
or your Venus is well-aspected.

00:23:46.842 --> 00:23:47.509
Could be.

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.970
I have to be very honest with you.

00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:52.139
What is it today?

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.516
Could it be just that he needs money?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.226
I think it's more than that.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.729
- Trying how?
- What did he even do?

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:01.731
But you stress me out everyday.

00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:03.900
Wow, she's going to feel so guilty, man.

00:24:03.984 --> 00:24:05.861
Oh, he plays games, like…

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.155
Emotional blackmail.

00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:12.075
You cheated on me, you know that.

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.577
- We didn't know that!
- Cheated?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.453
Bombshell!

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:17.914
- The Turkish girl, remember?
- Oh, my goodness.

00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:19.040
Bombshell.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.042
Turkish girl?

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.462
- What a scoundrel, he is!
- Stop being crazy, girl! Just end it!

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:26.381
No, this guy is bad news.
Someone has to tell her, they have to.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.884
Totally. Someone has to tell
her, please, for God's sake!

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.886
Oh, then it's all
wrong, man. Oh, it's over.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.888
Poor girl! What is she doing in Korea?

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.097
Manchild!

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:35.891
Immature.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:39.478
- My God, what a scandal!
- That's crazy! She never told us that!

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.228
Oh my God, yeah!

00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:43.064
Man, he cheated on her!
With the Turkish girl!

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.026
But how did he get the money to
get this Turkish girl too? Yeah!

00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:47.694
Yeah, if he doesn't have money?

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:50.780
- I am shook--
- Man, that Korean guy is naughty.

00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:52.115
When did he cheat?

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:53.617
Oh my God, I'll go get her on
my bike, for God's sake. Damn…

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.411
Bro, I can forgive cheating, but don't
get back together. If you cheat, bye,

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:57.287
you're on your own.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.040
Can you imagine leaving
Brazil to go suffer in Korea?

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.166
I'm speechless. Wow!

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.294
- No.
- To get cheated on in Korea? How do you

00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:06.922
say "cheating" in Korean? I don't even
know, I'm shook.

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.173
- Wow.
- Wow, my friend.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:11.593
- So he cheated on her?
- Guys, I cannot believe that

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.053
he wants to dump her. You--

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:13.803
It's over.

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.056
- Oh my God.
- How come?

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:19.226
- Hang on, my love.
- Girl… Oh, no, you guys, I'm curious.

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:22.354
Netflix, I want to know more. Where's
that Turkish girl?I want to have a word

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:24.439
