WEBVTT

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.886
{\an8}We grow up believing
that if we do everything right,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.430
things will work out in the end.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.683
But life doesn't offer guarantees.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.771
How many times has it promised sunshine
and delivered a storm instead?

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.482
Hoping for the best is only human.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.319
Being ready for the worst is survival.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.117
She'll get here and
I'll have to tell her we're engaged.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.827
I'm so screwed.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.626
Is my clothes okay?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.587
- Yeah, nice. Very nice.
- Yeah, good?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.261
'Cause you said I should wear
the other clothes, so, yeah.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.179
Ah…

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.514
I changed.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:59.517
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.727
Hello!

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.980
Everything okay?

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.067
Oh, she looks good.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.945
Oh, she said you look stunning today.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.238
Good? Thank you.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.740
Beautiful.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.200
She got prettier.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.329
What? What?

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:23.249
She said now
you look prettier than before.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.542
Oh, thank you.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.797
- I want to try it, yeah.
- Looks like it has mangoes.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.465
It looks good.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.551
- This also looks good.
- Just pull it.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:34.511
It's inside.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.519
I was talking to Morena the other day,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.771
and I proposed to her.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:46.856
Mm.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.733
I just thought you should know.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:58.409
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:07.043
- We want to marry this year.
- Yes.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.463
- As soon as possible.
- Yes, because I want baby.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:17.846
And you can say I would really like
she come to my wedding in church?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.724
Morena wants to get married
in Brazil as well.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:27.647
She's asking if you would come
for the ceremony.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.067
In Brazil? It's a 30-hour flight.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:39.826
So we should set the date
for the Korean ceremony then, right?

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.706
At first, when Su-woong…

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.875
uh…

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:51.379
told me that
he had a Brazilian girlfriend,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.256
I didn't know what to do.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.676
She was
very embarrassed with the situation

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.097
when I said to my mom
that I had a Brazilian girlfriend.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.015
I know.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:06.019
It was kind of a shock.
It was disconcerting.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.104
She was very shocked.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.815
Yes, I know. This is really not easy.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:18.156
- So, I wrote a letter for your mom.
- Ah.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.283
Can you read for her?

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.035
Should I translate it?

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.745
No, no. It's already translated.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.330
I prepared everything.

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:28.791
Morena wrote a letter to you, Mom.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.376
- A letter?
- Yes.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.005
It seems that
the letter made Su-woong tense.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:35.089
In Korean?

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:37.800
Loud, please.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.012
But this is
the only chance I have to talk to her

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.514
without him translating everything.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.808
"Dear Mother-in-Law."

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:46.976
In Korean?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.894
Yes.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:53.066
"Thank you for raising an amazing,
handsome, and kind man

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.068
who has such good character."

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.657
"I feel truly blessed
to have met your son."

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:07.121
"When I imagine Su-woong by my side
as the father of our future children,

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.375
I feel like the happiest girl alive."

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.504
"The news that
the son you raised with so much love

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.173
is about to live
on the other side of the world…"

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.931
- Mm?
- What?

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.183
They…

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.523
Don't cry.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.858
No…

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.195
I want to cry too if you cry.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.323
I'm going to keep reading.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.374
Oh no. Now I feel shy. Why I made this…

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:58.131
"When I think about
how hard this must be for you,

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.217
it breaks my heart too."

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.931
Don't cry! Si-omoni, don't cry.
No, no, no, no.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.225
Don't cry, this is really…

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.476
Don't cry.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.395
Don't cry so, please.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.614
"But I want you to know
that my mom and my aunt

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.660
will love Su-woong like a son,
and they'll take good care of him."

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.414
"I hope this can bring you some comfort."

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.676
"Thank you for welcoming me
into your family

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.262
and for giving us your blessing."

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:53.353
"When my dreams come true
and our family starts to grow,

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:55.855
we'll be even happier."

00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.942
"Even if we're in
different parts of the world,

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.904
we'll still be under the same sky."

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.989
"I promise we'll love each other

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.867
and we'll always be together."

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.996
"I'll visit you more often from now on."

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.832
"Take good care of your health."

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.502
"I want to make
many good memories together."

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.045
"Thank you."

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.838
"Morena ollim."

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:25.510
Yeah, please, give to her.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:27.387
Oh no!

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.390
Please, don't, no cry.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.563
If this is what my son wants,

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.858
I'm happy for both of you.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.112
And, since you're getting married,

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.863
I can only bless your union.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:51.661
"This is my… son's choice,
and I respect this."

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:55.540
"And I am still celebrating,"

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:59.210
and giving support to you and me.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.087
Thank you very much.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.094
If this is what you want…

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.848
the most important thing…

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.018
is to be responsible with one another.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.397
We have to be, yeah,
responsible for our choice.

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:22.692
- Love each other…
- Love each other.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.818
Until the end.

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.904
- Yeah.
- And have a happy family.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.575
You've got to promise me that.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.163
She said we have to…

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:40.751
We must promise,
all our future, to make our

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:47.508
bright and good future
until the end of our life.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.303
- She said we have to--
- I really…

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.973
She said she wants that too. And so do I.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.812
But can you say to her,
we will come to Korea many times.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.816
And we don't know the future,
maybe we have to live here for some time.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.026
I don't know, we don't know.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.736
We plan to come here often.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.989
And we don't know what the future holds.

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:13.075
How often? I need you to be more specific.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.622
How many times a year?
You've got to be more specific.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.374
At least once a year.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.502
Yeah, once a year.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.171
But we'll come more often if we can.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:28.841
What saddens me is that
we can't communicate.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.718
Her and I.

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:36.307
When you have kids,
you'll need to teach them Korean.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.266
Yeah.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.936
I'd like that too.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.357
We can enroll them in a school
or try to teach them ourselves.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.901
Morena will have to learn it too.

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:51.864
- She really wants to communicate with you.
- Yeah.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.117
Correctly, with any… Maybe Korean, or…

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.579
I need to learn Korean.
I will learn Korean. I promise.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:06.462
And she also wants
to make our babies learn Korean too.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.840
- Yeah, yeah. That's very important.
- Mm.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.511
It's not often that life gifts a reality

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.721
that's better than your expectations.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.518
But when it happens,

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.064
it becomes one of those moments
that not even time can erase.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.903
Hey, diva!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.239
How are you? I brought you something.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.243
A little heart!

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:42.081
- Thank you so much. For you too.
- A heart for you, lovestruck bride-to-be!

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.501
- Oh, I'm so happy, you know? Wow!
- What did you do today? I'm curious.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.379
- It was a brunch with Su-woong's mom.
- Oh, how chic!

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:49.297
So?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.303
She told me that, at first, she had
negative feelings about our relationship.

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:58.556
She's worried about him
leaving and everything.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:03.811
But she can't do anything,
it's his life, she understands.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:08.274
And he read the letter to her,
but he cried.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:10.401
Oh my God, poor thing!

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:14.155
When he started reading
the letter and cried,

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:17.283
I realized he's hurting too,
you know? Like…

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:19.410
It's not an easy decision for him.

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:22.121
He's making a big sacrifice, you know?

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:24.165
- You can see how much he loves you.
- I had no idea.

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:25.625
That shows how much he loves you.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:29.295
Because he's spent his whole life
with his mom, with his family,

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.422
and now he's moving to another country.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:33.257
That's proof of his love for you.

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:34.800
Yeah, it really is.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.969
I want to be like that too
someday, Morena.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.222
- Find a love… Yeah.
- You will, you will, you will.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.766
- Just take it easy.
- Take it easy!

00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:44.644
I thought nothing
would ever happen for me.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.812
I'd totally given up on love.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.314
- Then you met him.
- And then it came.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:04.789
Morena!

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:06.624
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.250
Hi! Good to see you again!

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.168
Let's go!

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:11.504
This way.

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:20.721
Morena, it's coming too soon.
How do you feel?

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.181
My God!

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.185
Oh, my God. I'm in paradise!

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:30.981
Just feel free to take a look and choose.
Take your time.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.984
Oh my God, Su-woong,
everything very bling-bling, like a queen.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.903
Bling-bling!

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.488
Wow.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.208
I really like this.

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.876
I think it suits her.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.336
Yeah, like a queen!

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.296
Yeah, we thought this fits you.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.007
- You'll look like a queen.
- Oh my God!

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.679
Can we marry tomorrow?

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:02.596
Yeah, where?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.557
Tomorrow. Now?

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:08.185
- This one is also--
- Oh, very nice! But can we put something--

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.396
- Yeah, nice. Sure, sure.
- Yes, you can.

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.315
Yeah.

00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:16.777
Oh, difficult.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.237
What do you think?

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:21.031
- The flower one is special.
- Yeah, special, no?

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.784
I think this looks good
on shooting outside.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.911
Oh, with flowers and…

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:30.458
You have a beautiful body,
I think this one would look great on you.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:34.128
Oh, this maybe I don't like so much,
because I have much here, so--

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.381
- Oh, really?
- We think that's why it fits you.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.049
Ah, with curves.

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.760
I don't want sexy dress.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.471
- I really want more…
- Oh, but I want to put you in one.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.181
- You don't want?
- No. Not sexy.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:48.017
I will never understand
this Korean tradition

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.020
of the groom choosing the dress
with the bride. The craziest thing!

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.939
Well, at least Su-woong has good taste.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.566
For the shooting event.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:58.694
- Yeah, for shooting--
- You can try different concepts.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.447
She wants something
more regal for the ceremony.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.657
Oh my God.
I don't know which one to choose!

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.454
And you can wear
the red dress that you saw.

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:10.247
Oh, the red is also here?

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.959
Yeah, I love… I like red.

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.343
Oh, nice!

00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:23.260
Nice!

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.554
It's my mother-in-law!

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:29.225
Oh, very happy!

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:31.602
She's surprised!

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.771
Yeah! That's so cool!

00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:34.772
Have a seat.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.608
I don't know what to do.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.946
Hello!

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:44.448
Hi. I'm helping them
with the wedding planning.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.699
Right. I know.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.285
I believe she was surprised.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.538
Are you surprised?

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.958
Yeah, very surprised!

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:54.875
Excited!

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.504
What kind of dress
would you like her to try?

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.048
Uh… A glamorous one!

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:02.174
- What else?
- Graceful.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.509
And beautiful!

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:05.803
- Very pretty dress that she wants for you.
- Yeah! Yeah!

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.559
- The final decision is up to the bride.
- Yeah, your decision is most important.

00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.435
- Morena's style.
- It's Morena's style.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.105
She cares about
her mother-in-law's opinion.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.147
She does?

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.692
- You really care for her. A mom's…
- Yes, yeah.

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:23.737
My mom is not here to help me.
So she can help me.

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:28.951
But you know, in Brazil, you and your mom
cannot see me with wedding dress.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.828
We say it's not good luck.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.956
- Let's go try? Yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.000
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.043
See you later!

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.817
Ah!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.070
And when the expectations for someone end,

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.866
we move on and form
new expectations with someone else.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:12.077
- Have you chosen?
- Well… I have, but we…

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.831
We're talking on here,
and I'll ask him when he wants to go out,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.124
what he wants to do…

00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:20.210
Actually, I don't want to know.
I want him to surprise me.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.630
I want to get there and be surprised.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.341
I hope it's something
really girly for us to do.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.637
- Wouldn't it be better if you said it?
- But I wanted, I wanted to…

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.598
maybe have a drink
so we can loosen up a bit.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.643
It's our first date.
We're just talking online.

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:39.271
So maybe have a drink,
take a little walk around the street.

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:40.856
Then the next day we can do…

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.733
I don't know, get a pedicure.

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:44.401
He does his nails, you know.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.196
- Yeah. He does his nails.
- He does?

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.680
- Oh my God!
- I love you!

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.807
That's great!

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.017
Stunning!

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.144
- Good?
- Wow! Stunning!

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:20.396
Very good!

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:23.273
- Muito bonita!
- Muito bonita?

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.025
Queen?

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.152
I love you.

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:30.030
Turn around. Yes, you can turn…

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:32.741
No air, Su-woong. Cannot breathe.

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:34.702
No, no!

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.745
Oh!

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:38.664
Take a picture.

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.208
Oh, and to think

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:45.546
I'm the first person in my family
to have a full church wedding.

00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:50.801
I really wish my mom could see me
like this. This is her dream too.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.014
Nice?

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.390
It looks amazing!

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:57.391
Red, I like it.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:16:59.810
You like red? Red lips?

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:01.645
Red lips.

00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.022
Red lipstick?

00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:07.151
Okay?

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.862
- Pretty?
- Oh, how pretty!

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:11.530
It would look like this.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.199
- Very nice pictures.
- This is the inspiration for the theme.

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:17.161
Oh.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.180
Oh, I hope he's a nice guy.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.016
But what if he has nothing to talk about?

00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.517
What if he has bad breath?

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.269
What if he doesn't like cats?

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.481
Stop, diva! Let it flow.

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.029
Oh.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.031
Hello!

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:55.074
Hello!

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.366
Good evening!

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.161
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm okay. Fine. Good.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.790
- Fine. Good. I have something for you.
- Oh, really?

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.919
- Ha!
- Wow.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:08.754
- You put on this one.
- Mm.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.381
Thank you.

00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:13.342
This way can communicate better.

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.593
Mm.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:20.224
- Good.
- Good.

00:18:20.307 --> 00:18:21.934
Yay!

00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:24.728
It's an honor to be here with you.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.272
Oh, thank you, me too.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.317
You can call me Katy.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.194
- Oh, Katy?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.530
My name is Sang-il Park.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.198
Park Sang-il.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.282
Park Sang-il.

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.200
Yes!

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.159
- Oh!
- Oh.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.911
Your pronunciation is very good.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:43.539
Thank you!

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.332
And what do you like to do?

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:50.587
What do I like to do?
Actually, I'm a singer.

00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:55.008
I like to write and listen to music.

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.469
Oh, and you look like an idol.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:58.387
Thank you very much!

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.140
- "Like an idol"?
- "Like an idol"? Oh!

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:02.474
See? Yeah!

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.518
Are you an actress?

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:07.437
No, I work in a bank.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.981
Oh!

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.650
But I studied fashion.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:16.530
Wow, that explains
why you're so fashionable.

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:17.865
Thank you!

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.200
Do you want something to drink?

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.743
Yeah, definitely!

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.627
How much alcohol can you handle?

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.212
You have to teach me.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.214
Yes!

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.507
A lot.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.720
I actually can't handle that much alcohol.

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:44.016
But since Katy is here,
I'm gonna enjoy some drinks.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.311
Okay, it'll be great. Let's go.

00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:48.520
Let's drink.

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.064
I'll do my best.

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.485
Usually, we pour this amount…

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.738
of soju. Like this.

00:19:57.821 --> 00:19:58.864
- Mm-hmm.
- And then…

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.743
- This amount of beer.
- Oh, okay.

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.204
After that…

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.122
And now? What do we do?

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.416
We get a spoon and…

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.169
Mm.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.506
Yeah! Oh!

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:19.009
You're doing great.

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.304
See? I'm already a pro.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.140
Cheers!

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:35.192
In Portuguese, we say,

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.109
"Saúde."

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.862
- Saúde?
- Saúde.

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.197
Saúde. Ah.

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.574
- Saúde!
- Like geonbae?

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.076
- Jjan. Geonbae.
- Jjan?

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.202
Geonbae.

00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:46.828
Geonbae. Geonbae!

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.747
- Saúde!
- Saúde! Ah.

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.042
Mm.

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.920
- Good?
- Very good! Yeah.

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:21.530
"Hey, Mari, I want to take you
to one of my favorite places in Seoul."

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:22.447
"You in?"

00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:28.870
Definitely! Let's go.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.039
Let's do this! I'm ready!

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.846
There it is. Expectations strike again.

00:21:45.929 --> 00:21:49.641
Sometimes it's impossible
not to give in to the "what if?"

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.019
What if today we have our first kiss?

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.773
This place is really nice.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.400
- I'm so happy to be here.
- Really?

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.735
Yeah, such a special moment.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.653
Did you go see, like, Han River before?

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.238
- No. Like--
- It's the first time, right?

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.783
This is a place
I-I always dreamed of, like, visiting.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:12.331
Like one of my favorite… Like, top five
spots in Korea that I wanted to visit.

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:14.458
- Mm.
- Thank you for bringing me here.

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:16.251
- Seriously.
- I mean, I think this spot,

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:18.712
this bridge, is called Banpo Bridge.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.547
- Okay!
- And it's really famous.

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:22.632
Why is it so famous?

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:27.471
Well, there are, like, special things
happening around here. Like,

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:29.806
for example, like,
they're singing right now.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.017
- Oh.
- There might be some people dancing…

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.518
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:35.979
- Whoo!
- You gonna dance too?

00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:40.233
Okay, thank you for that twist.

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:45.197
Oh, look at that.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.156
What?

00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:48.742
- Yeah, actually, that's the fountain.
- Can we go there?

00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:51.995
Yeah, we're going… Of course.
We came here for that, too actually.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.080
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.332
- Want to sit here?
- It's so nice. Yes, of course.

00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:56.416
Let's sit here.

00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:01.546
- It's such an amazing view, right?
- Yeah.

00:23:02.422 --> 00:23:06.426
So, I think… I don't know
exactly when it's going to start…

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.011
- Mm-hmm.
- …but it's really fun.

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.221
Yeah, really fun.

00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:15.560
How do you… How do you feel,
being around so many Korean couples?

00:23:15.644 --> 00:23:18.772
Did you brought me to a place where…

00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.983
Where couples normally go? Like--

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.528
- Is this a place for couples?
- Yeah, because, like--

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:28.323
Danny, this means we are, like,
a couple or something? What's happening?

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.409
What's happening?

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:32.077
Yeah.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.079
- I mean, it's beautiful.
- I'm happy to be here. Yes!

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:36.331
- It's beautiful and I wanted to bring you.
- Yeah.

00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.931
It's so pretty!

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.075
- Oh!
- Oh! Wait, never mind.

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:13.577
Wait a minute, wait a damn minute!

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.370
Encore. There's an encore.

00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:17.622
You think so?

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:18.540
Yes.

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:22.627
I noticed people here
aren't really into kissing in public.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:24.713
But it's so dark out here.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.299
Come on, Danny, do something!

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.898
- Shall we go for a walk?
- Yeah, maybe.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.609
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, I don't know, but…

00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:47.027
Yeah, let's go.

00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.780
One, two, three. Shoop!

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:53.450
Yes, let's go.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:54.826
- Yeah.
- Let's go that way.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.661
- Okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:10.967
I heard that Brazilian people are

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.470
very warm and affectionate.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.181
Is that true?

00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:21.686
We are very lively.
Brazilians are very warm people.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.565
So, we hug a lot, we kiss each other.

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:30.654
For example, when we greet each other,
we hug and kiss on the cheek.

00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.864
If you do that here,

00:25:33.406 --> 00:25:36.034
people will give you strange looks.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.619
- We--
- Yeah!

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:41.373
- We greet people like, "Hello."
- Hello.

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.208
- Yes.
- Yeah!

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:46.461
Can you teach me… Brazilian Portuguese?

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:49.381
I can. What do you want to know
in Portuguese?

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.758
How do you say "You're so pretty"?

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.678
Você é bonita.

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:55.929
Você é bonita.

00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:57.514
- Uh-huh. Você é bonita.
- Você é bonita.

00:25:57.597 --> 00:25:59.307
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm!

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.184
Thank you.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.272
Um… "You are good-looking"?

00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:06.982
Oh!

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.985
That was very good.

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.779
I know a couple of things like that.

00:26:12.862 --> 00:26:16.324
You need to teach me
more about Korean culture.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.619
From our conversation so far,

00:26:20.453 --> 00:26:22.581
- I can tell we have a lot in common.
- Yeah.

00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:29.254
- My nails… they're very big. Look.
- Mm.

00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:32.507
So, using the chopsticks
is a bit of a challenge.

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.385
You'll have to feed me.

00:26:35.468 --> 00:26:36.845
You'll have to put it in my mouth.

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.930
Want me to feed you?

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.476
Easy now.

00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:46.354
Thank you.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:50.150
Have you ever dated before?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.112
Yes, I have dated before.

00:26:54.195 --> 00:26:58.450
I was in a serious relationship
about… three years ago.

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:02.954
We dated for about two years.

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:04.873
I met her two years ago.

00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:10.712
We broke up because…

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.798
I was so into music

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:19.220
that I didn't have much time
to go out with her.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.764
- So…
- Mm-hmm.

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:23.016
We broke up because of that.

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:27.395
It's complicated. I've dated
other musicians before. I think I just…

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:32.359
Because I've been with musicians,
I know how complicated it can be.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.569
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:38.531
So, Katy, when was your last relationship?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.911
I wouldn't say it was a relationship.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:46.373
Because in Brazil
it's a little different from Korea.

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.791
We have a term that's…

00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:48.792
Ficar.

00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.168
- And…
- Ficar?

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:52.420
Ficar. And then we don't date.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.881
We have a relationship,

00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.800
but we don't actually date.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.595
So, I end up doing that a lot.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:02.597
Because…

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:07.602
So, for example, sometimes
on the first date, people end up kissing.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:09.312
Wow.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:11.523
That's a huge culture shock!

00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:12.899
So that's how it works?

00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:15.485
Have you ever kissed someone
on the first date?

00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:19.447
Yes…. I have.

00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.908
Ppoppo? Ppoppo?

00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:23.284
- Ppoppo? Ppoppo.
- Ppoppo.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.286
Ppoppo. A little kiss.

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:30.166
Do you want to try it?

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.835
Ah. A little kiss?

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:32.919
- Yeah.
- Ah.

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:37.924
If that's your culture,
then… okay, no problem.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:39.175
I'm ready to try it.

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:42.262
But only if you want to. Like…

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:43.346
Ah.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.974
Teach me how it is in Korea.

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:47.684
First, we kiss on the cheek.

00:28:49.602 --> 00:28:50.437
On the cheek?

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:52.272
Yes.

00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:56.568
I can't believe I'm on a real date.

00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:57.819
That's all I wanted.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.446
I'm blushing.

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:04.075
A little food,
a little drink, a little kiss…

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:07.203
I knew Korea wouldn't let me down.

00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:10.957
I really liked going out with you today.
I had a lot of fun.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.501
I haven't had this much fun
in a long time.

00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:15.754
Let's do one last toast,

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:17.046
and then we'll go.

00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:21.176
- Shall we?
- Yes. Let's go.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:23.011
Let's go together? Let's go together!

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.220
Let's go together!

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:32.854
I want to take a picture of you.
Can I borrow your phone?

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:33.938
Okay.

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.316
Here, look.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.485
I'll take it for you.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.912
Oh!

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:57.128
- Do you want to take a selfie with me?
- Yeah.

00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.465
Let's take a picture together.

00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:05.011
Finally, someone fabulous I can call mine.

00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:07.347
I can't wait to see him again.

00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:12.060
Good!

00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:14.854
Yay!

00:30:15.688 --> 00:30:16.981
It was so much fun meeting you.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:17.982
Yeah!

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:32.497
This place is so cool!

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.209
Yeah, we're actually walking
on the bridge.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.587
Okay.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.344
I feel like you're in
a K-drama scene right now.

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:47.554
This is K-drama.

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:49.472
Yeah, this is K-drama, everything.

00:30:49.556 --> 00:30:52.225
You're a K-drama main character.

00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:53.977
- No, you are.
- We are.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.061
Oh, okay.

00:30:56.646 --> 00:30:59.566
It's a beautiful view
under the bridge too, right?

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:00.483
Yeah.

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.152
Let's have a look at the…

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.867
See, look at the…

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.078
What I like about Korea is,
like, how everything's so bright.

00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:14.539
- Yeah, it's so beautiful.
- Neon.

00:31:14.622 --> 00:31:15.874
- Yeah!
- Orange.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:35.518
- I'm hugging you because…
- Mm-hmm.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:38.855
I'm not cold. I mean,
I'm not hugging you because I'm cold.

00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:40.148
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.066
Are you cold?

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.985
- No.
- No? You're good?

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:44.903
I'm good.

00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:45.820
Okay.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.129
It's okay.

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:09.969
Oh!

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:23.775
It was a "hi!"

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.234
Okay?

00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:26.277
Yeah.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.445
It was just a "hi".

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:30.073
Yeah.

00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:31.282
Okay.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:32.408
It was a "hi." Yeah.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:34.327
Let's go, bye-bye. Come on.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.703
What?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.289
What's going on? A kiss on the cheek?

00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.584
Did he just friend-zone me? Is that it?

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.544
I liked it.

00:32:44.712 --> 00:32:46.005
You got me, like--

00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:46.923
Blushing?

00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.758
- Yes.
- I mean… Yeah.

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:51.135
- I don't want to--
- But--

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:53.513
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You don't want to what?

00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:57.892
I don't want to, you know, rush things.

00:32:58.851 --> 00:32:59.686
No rush?

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.439
I respect your culture.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:06.985
It's fine.

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.238
I'm just trying to…

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.864
Like…

00:33:13.241 --> 00:33:14.200
I'm, like, yeah…

00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:15.952
Careful, be careful.

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:20.123
You're being careful.

00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.040
It's okay.

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:25.753
Careful with what? We're not
going skydiving. It's just a kiss.

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.171
Is this a real-life K-drama?

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:30.383
Waiting until the last second to kiss?

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.219
Let's just go.

00:33:57.493 --> 00:34:00.204
Neither expectations nor reality.

00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:04.000
Sometimes all that's left is frustration.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.837
I've got some tea for you.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.172
- Where are the girls?
- Hey!

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:12.341
- I heard you have some tea to spill.
- She shows up when she hears I have news.

00:34:12.925 --> 00:34:14.719
Guys, so here's the tea.

00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.596
Fourth date with Danny.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.597
Where did you go?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.474
We went to the Han River.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.560
- Didn't you go to his house?
- Yes, he… Oh, that happened too.

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.187
I went to his house, I get there.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.148
The guy welcomes me in a tank top,
Mr. Muscle.

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.442
His body on display like that.

00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:31.903
- Sweaty?
- He's like… all sweaty.

00:34:31.986 --> 00:34:34.822
Then I go into his house.
Girl, this man cooked for me.

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.449
- Oh, that's beautiful!
- He cooked.

00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:39.285
- He was standing at the counter like this…
- Wow!

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:40.828
Girl, he was like this!

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:41.788
Camila!

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:44.665
- Camila… Danny was like this.
- Did he cook ramen?

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:48.044
And he was looking at me
and being like, "Is it good?"

00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:49.879
Did he make ramen?

00:34:49.962 --> 00:34:52.632
I wouldn't be able to eat.
It's a lot of pressure.

00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:55.218
"Come here now!"

00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:57.470
"Stop cooking, now!"

00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:03.434
Then we went on a date yesterday,
and I'm not going to lie to you.

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.686
It was the most romantic of my life.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.397
It was at River Han where the bridge is,
I forgot the name.

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.857
There are those dancing waters

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:13.319
that are synchronized with the rhythm
of the music. There's like, the bleachers.

00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:16.114
A lot of people.
Then, girl, come here for a sec.

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.490
Come here, I'll show you.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.825
I want to see

00:35:18.908 --> 00:35:20.701
- the reenactment of this kiss.
- Who's who?

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.870
- Am I Danny?
- You are Danny.

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.831
Oh wow, what a beautiful bridge!

00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:25.748
Wow!

00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:29.460
Hi, Danny. No… he didn't do that!

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.295
- Oh no!
- If he had done that…

00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:34.882
- How boring! Not even yesterday?
- …I would be more relaxed now, you know?

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.176
More relaxed, like, "Ah, I got kissed!"

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.928
- Girl, but I wonder--
- It didn't happen?

00:35:39.011 --> 00:35:41.681
Guys! He didn't kiss me.
He didn't kiss me.

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.933
Could it be because it was a public place?

00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:46.686
There were a lot of people there
watching and whatever.

00:35:46.769 --> 00:35:47.895
I think so.

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:50.064
And it would have been
your very first kiss.

00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:52.191
Yeah. But is he stringing me along?

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.652
- Do you feel like he likes you?
- I do.

00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:58.197
Then let it happen.
Give him time. He's nervous.

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.907
- I think so too.
- He's thinking too far ahead.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.909
- I think he is.
- It's cute to go slow like that.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:02.952
I think it's cute.

00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:05.913
No, but not that slow either,
right, Morena?

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:09.208
After three years,
we'll be able to hold hands.

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:11.586
- Yeah, then it'll be…
- We'll be 50 years old.

00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:13.588
…a year of this.

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.715
Today, after a year. After 100 days,

00:36:15.798 --> 00:36:18.217
because they have
this 100-day thing, right?

00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:34.525
Hey, girl!

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:38.321
How are you?

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:40.948
I wanted to meet his mom here.

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.533
You've never met her, right?

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:45.620
Never seen her in person, I'm dying to.
I've only seen her on video calls.

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:46.537
I see.

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.747
Shall we call her?

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.081
Will you help me translate?

00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.041
It's fucking hard!

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:51.709
Sure.

00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:55.630
And ask. Ask her if she's busy
and if she doesn't want to see me.

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.049
- Because Si-won said she was busy.
- Okay!

00:36:58.674 --> 00:36:59.884
All right, let's call her.

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:11.103
I don't think she wants to take my call.

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:12.688
Oh man.

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:17.568
One day you'll see her.

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:20.446
And then you can arrange it with Si-won.

00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:44.345
- Mari!
- We're here!

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.638
Are you happy?

00:37:46.138 --> 00:37:47.807
- Are you ready for this?
- I'm so ready.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.185
We're going to see a street show
of people who want to be idols.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.693
Oh, is there room there?

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.237
It's here. Hello.

00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:38.190
Guys, I'll see you at home.

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:39.525
Si-won is nearby.

00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:40.860
- Really?
- Oh, girl!

00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:43.070
- Are you leaving?
- I'm going to meet him. Talk to you later.

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:45.406
- Okay. All right!
- If you need anything, call us.

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.324
Bye-bye.

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:47.325
- Bye!
- Kisses.

00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:48.659
Kisses, girl.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.213
Luanny!

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.762
Are you okay?

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:11.974
I want to take you somewhere.

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:13.684
Where?

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:17.313
It's a tarot house for couples.

00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:21.400
- I'm scared.
- I think you got this.

00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:23.194
Why?

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:25.446
Do you see that?

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.116
- There?
- That's the tarot house.

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:31.619
Shall we go?

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.126
- Hello!
- Hello, welcome.

00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:42.088
- Hello.
- Take a seat. What a pretty girl you are!

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:45.549
Thank you.

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.178
So what brings you two here?

00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:51.013
We're a couple.

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.306
Ah, I see.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.186
So, I'm very curious to see
whether our relationship has a future.

00:39:57.269 --> 00:40:00.606
If we're gonna get married and stuff.

00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:02.942
Let's ask the cards.

00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:05.861
Let's put them here.

00:40:15.162 --> 00:40:19.125
I need you two to place
your hands here, together.

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.627
- We have to place our hands here.
- Right here.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.003
Okay, okay.

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.131
Take a deep breath

00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:26.549
and relax.

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:28.259
Just relax.

00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:29.844
- Take a deep breath.
- Right.

00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:30.886
Just breathe.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.971
Breathe.

00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:39.854
Now each of you will take three cards.
Don't overthink it.

00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:45.526
One more.

00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:50.698
Your turn.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.671
You have trust issues.

00:41:06.338 --> 00:41:07.673
You are the problem.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:12.470
You're too afraid of getting hurt.

00:41:14.054 --> 00:41:15.473
Easy for you to say, ma'am.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:17.641
To get over it,
I just have to talk to his mother.

00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:28.777
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:29.695
Thank you.

00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:31.780
See you next time.

00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.908
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:41:35.784 --> 00:41:37.912
Everything she said was true.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:00.434
It's a memory for a lifetime, isn't it?

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.520
HI, LUANNY! HOW ARE YOU?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.690
You got a message, Luanny.

00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:07.691
For me?

00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:11.111
- Your mother-in-law.
- What?

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:14.448
- Can you read it?
- No.

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.992
I'll translate it for you.

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:21.705
She says she really wants
to meet up with you.

00:42:23.249 --> 00:42:25.543
She said she's coming here to meet you.

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:26.710
What?

00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:28.212
Lord have mercy!

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:34.969
Girl, you've wanted this to happen
since we got here.

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.680
Now that it's happening, I'm scared.

00:42:37.763 --> 00:42:39.014
It's scary, right?

00:42:39.598 --> 00:42:43.102
But should I just say everything
the first time I meet her?

00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:44.853
- You have to.
- What if it's the last?

00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:47.064
- When will you tell her?
- Am I going to die?

00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:50.025
- No, just think.
- We're going back to Brazil, honey.

00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:52.611
No, but think about it.
You've been here for a long time.

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:55.114
Weren't you waiting
to meet her in person to tell her?

00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:56.031
Yeah.

00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:58.867
If you don't say it now,
it'll be awkward later.

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.954
She'll feel betrayed
if you don't tell her.

00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:04.415
Come on, girl, just say it.
It's gonna be fine.

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:07.668
And if it's not meant to be,
then it's not meant to be.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:10.087
Now the real fun begins.
