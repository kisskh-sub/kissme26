WEBVTT

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.970
{\an8}We grow up believing
that every story has a happy ending.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.848
That's what fairytales teach us.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.518
They just skipped the part where
the princess has to tell her mother-in-law

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.353
that she has a daughter.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.817
- Hello!
- Hi!

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.238
Oh…

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.576
You are… so pretty!

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.577
Oh, thank you!

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.633
Nice to meet you.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.428
Uh…

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.305
Have you been eating?

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.307
What is this?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.392
We can talk.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:01.311
What is this? Earphone?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440
Now we can understand each other.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.319
Yes. It's good to meet you!

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.696
So, now we can finally talk to each other.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.199
I'm happy to meet you, ma'am.

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.326
Is Si-won okay?

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.370
Oh, he's fine.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.707
As a mother,
I am always worried about him.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.129
How can I say this?

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.881
He has a good heart.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.550
He's a… good person.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.762
He never gave me any trouble
when he was a kid.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.431
Si-won can give me
a bit of a headache sometimes.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.351
But he has a very kind heart.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.435
Mom…

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.063
can I…

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.273
ask you something?

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.691
Mm.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.153
Everyone has the power
to write their own story.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.239
But fate can change everything.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:02.622
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.589
Hey.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.507
Olá!

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.424
Hi!

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.969
Coffee?

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.053
Thank you.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.721
You're welcome.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.058
- Cheers!
- Cheer…

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:22.976
Saúde!

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.935
- Saúde!
- Saúde.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:25.687
Are you ready?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.814
Let's go.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.527
- It's cold!
- Walking in the sun will warm you up.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.445
Yeah.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.157
- Is that where we're going jogging?
- Over there.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:38.700
On the other side.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:40.743
So, where that dog is?

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.287
- It's past the dog.
- Past the dog?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.246
Yeah.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.748
That's where the jogging track is.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.042
- Slowly?
- Slowly.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.670
One, two, one, two?

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:55.008
Yeah, because your legs
are way longer than mine, so…

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.343
You're gonna have to keep my pace.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.470
- Of course. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.388
Your pace.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.098
Yeah.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.399
My pace. Yes!

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.400
You know?

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.820
- Do you run like this in Brazil, too?
- I…

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.990
- run every day.
- Yeah? Every day?

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:19.908
Every day.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.912
Co-- Competition.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.663
- Running. Competition.
- Competition running?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.500
Yeah, I was… training for competitions.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.127
And were you running here?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.503
A bit further down.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.322
- Here?
- Yeah.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.910
I knew today was gonna be a hot day.

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.537
I wanted to give you

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.747
something before you leave.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.667
Do you know the Korean word for this?
Buchae?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.795
Ah, yeah. I know. This in Brazil--

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.838
Are you familiar with carnival?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.591
- Oh, carnival?
- Yeah, they use this in carnival,

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:19.842
'cause it's hot.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.026
How cute.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.445
I really like the color black.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:41.114
You got it just for me?

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.283
- I bought it just for you.
- Really?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.284
Thank you.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.161
- I don't have anything for you.
- Oh, don't worry.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.208
You know the next time you come to Korea,
I'll make sure to cook for you.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.751
- You cook?
- I do.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:54.669
What do you cook?

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.004
Ah, Korean food.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.131
- Korean food?
- Kimchi jjigae, doeniang jjigae…

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.424
- I like kimchi.
- Kimchi jjim.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:00.550
- Kimchi jjim?
- Yeah.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.467
I like kimchi jjim.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.262
Can I ask you something I'm curious about?

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.388
- About me?
- Yeah.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.639
Okay, sure.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.143
In Brazil, what's the…

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.729
Uh…

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.233
What's the dating scene like over there?
Do you do blind dates? Or…

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.443
Ah…

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.321
- We do blind dates, friends of friends.
- Oh yeah?

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.572
Yeah, friends in common.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.282
- Friends of friends?
- Yeah.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.743
- What about you?
- What?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.785
What?

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.412
Usually…

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:30.997
Like…

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.999
- Have you dated before?
- Yeah, sure.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:35.168
- Ever had a relationship? Ah.
- Of course I have!

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.627
You're 38?

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.423
Thirty-eight. Yeah.
I'll be 40 pretty soon.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.632
- Forty?
- Yeah.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:42.717
You…

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:45.219
don't look like--

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.346
Ah, thank you.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.097
How many relationships? And when?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.058
- Hm…
- Just curious.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:51.809
Well…

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.605
- After I turned 20 years old.
- After you turned 20?

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.482
Yeah. After I turned 20.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.901
Mm… Maybe…

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.823
- Really?
- No. Just kidding. Um…

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:07.992
Five relationships.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.369
- Five times?
- Yeah.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.788
Oh my God. That's a lot of relationships.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.289
- You think so?
- Yeah.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.917
I've had two relationships.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.502
- Two.
- Yeah.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.669
Uh, if it's okay…

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.923
You know,
I'd love to see you one last time

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:24.217
before you have to leave for Brazil.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.094
Okay, you can text me.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.346
I'm not that into…

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.140
uh… texting a lot.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.768
In Brazil, I'm offline

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:35.978
- most of the time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.105
Because…

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:42.402
I'm not really into
spending a lot of time online.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.030
But I use the internet a lot for chatting.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.782
Well, I'll, um…

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:49.575
- text you.
- Okay.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.493
Yeah.

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:52.328
So, um…

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:56.416
In Brazil, how do you guys say, "Bye-bye"?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.333
Bye-bye?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.418
- In Brazil, yeah.
- Tchau.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:06:59.335
Tchau?

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.212
Yeah, that's what we say.

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:03.589
We say bye-bye like this, okay?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.759
- Kiss here, kiss here. Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.594
The Brazilian way.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:12.557
- And when this is goodbye and hello.
- Goodbye…

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.643
- Goodbye and hello. Oh, the same.
- The same. Yeah.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:16.978
- Yes. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.604
- See you.
- See you. Bye-bye.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.485
Bye-bye.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.075
I don't believe in happily ever after.

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:35.246
But I believe in
happy moments along the way.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.375
Being at peace is
just as important as being happy.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.420
I've always tried to…

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.964
ignore my past,

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.717
but I think I did a good thing

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.553
by getting this over with.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:56.017
When it comes down to it,
it's the journey that makes us who we are.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.810
Not the final destination.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.745
I was going to wait
for Si-won to tell you this.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.789
- Mm.
- But…

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.378
If…

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:29.091
I have a daughter,
is that a problem for you?

00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:36.641
A daughter? I didn't know about that.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.898
I don't mind it.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.525
It's not a problem.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.527
I'm not that kind of person.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.529
I respect people.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.907
Life is so unpredictable.

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:55.451
Don't cry, Luanny.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.411
These things happen, it's life.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.997
Isn't that right, Luanny?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:00.998
Don't cry!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:05.127
Let go of those… bad thoughts. It's okay.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.338
I don't mind that.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.423
I'm not that kind of person.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.841
It's okay, don't cry.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:14.720
I didn't know you had been
holding all that inside you.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:15.846
Don't cry.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.807
You'll mess up that pretty face of yours.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.518
I'm not that kind of person.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.312
I have a tissue here somewhere.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.606
Life is like this.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:30.194
Everyone has their own struggles.
This could happen to anyone.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.572
Don't cry about it.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.701
We want a good life for our children.

00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:39.620
But parents shouldn't worry
so much about that.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:45.084
You just have to be a nice person and
have a good relationship with me, Luanny.

00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:47.587
Not because we are in-laws now,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.215
but to support each other
as a mother and as a daughter.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.801
Helping each other whenever we need it.

00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:57.013
Being present, giving love and affection.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.764
You know? Being together.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.349
That's the way I see things.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.394
I don't care if you have money or not.
It's okay.

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:07.106
- Thank you, Mom.
- This is life. That's all. I don't mind.

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:08.482
Not at all.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.153
I was a little scared.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:16.157
Because I know
our cultures are very different.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.743
Very opposite, but…

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:23.831
I was feeling awful
because I was hiding something.

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:26.125
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.252
It's okay.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.712
Just be responsible.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.965
Take good care of your daughter…
of each other.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.260
Help each other through difficult times.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.305
The main goal is to have a good life.

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:42.850
Having a good, happy life. Isn't it?
Everything is fine.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.687
The mood feels good.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.357
We're getting along.

00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:51.984
Mom gave me this, look.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:53.819
So, Mom.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.655
What's your first impression?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.031
She's so pretty!

00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.159
- Really? Sure about that?
- You have to be nice to her.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.082
- Anyway, Mom.
- Mm?

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.045
There are some things I didn't tell you.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.923
I know. She's just told me.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.758
- So you know?
- Yes.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.760
It's okay. I don't mind it.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.013
- It'll be good for you.
- I'm a… little bit scared.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:26.394
Now there's a lovely child in our lives.
I'm really glad.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.773
Loving your kids
shouldn't make you embarrassed.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.275
Children are a blessing. Don't you think?

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:36.570
You should be confident
and proud of your life.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.572
- Luanny…
- Do your best.

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.492
Luanny, you…

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:43.703
Uh…

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:47.289
To be honest, I already had a feeling that

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.751
when you met my mom, she would understand.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.380
I had a feeling that this would happen.

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:56.507
When you told her.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.053
I'm happy everything's settled.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.390
Thank you for accepting me, Mom.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.728
I promise I'll take care of him
and knock some sense into his head.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.275
And we'll come here to Korea
many times to visit you.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.737
And I'll bring you
many things from Brazil.

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.155
I promise.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.866
I'm not saying thank you.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:27.580
All I want is for you to get along well
from now on.

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:29.415
- Understand?
- We will.

00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:32.084
And love each other.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.335
Shall we?

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.088
Let's…

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.382
give Mom a hug.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.304
Let's go.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.182
Careful.

00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.896
In fairytales, the princess
faces off with witches and dragons

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:53.230
to live with the prince.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.233
My prince is not very… charming,

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.487
and I know my story
is far from a fairytale.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.156
But I still want to fight
for my happily ever after.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.700
Do you have
to get married and go to church

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.368
to start living your life?

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.245
So you're just wasting words, right?

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.083
Even if it's only a happily-for-now.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:17.463
And for now, I want to be
a little closer to his family,

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:21.133
to then bring him closer
to me and my daughter.

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.382
- Morena?
- I'm too tall.

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:03.467
You look so beautiful.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.844
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.804
- Muito bonita.
- Muito bonita?

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:07.847
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.265
Together?

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.850
- Yeah.
- Hm?

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.186
- Where is our sajinjagga? Down?
- Photographer?

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.274
A picture is a moment in time
immortalized by an image.

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:22.736
When this picture is taken by
one of the best photographers in Korea,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.614
that's when it's time
to be dressed to the nines.

00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:29.994
I wouldn't change
a single thing in my story.

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.872
There was surprise,

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.206
tension…

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.541
romance.

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.918
Will you marry me?

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.214
And in the end, everything worked out.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.424
Oh my God!

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.011
But this isn't really the end.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.347
A new chapter begins now.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:55.060
Marriage, moving to Brazil,
and a bright future ahead of us.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.428
Like that. Yes.

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.568
Okay! Good.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:46.737
I want to cry.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.197
I want to cry now.

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.534
No, don't cry!

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.912
- Don't cry.
- I'm very happy. We made really nice… Yes.

00:15:56.205 --> 00:16:00.334
For better or for worse,
in sickness and in health,

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:03.504
I say yes to everything that awaits us.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.787
Who would have thought that I'd
be here 'cause of a guy from Instagram?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.248
The place where everything is an illusion

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:42.418
helped me find a person
who makes my heart beat for real.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.839
It's so… crazy that I'm on
the other side of the world right now.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:47.965
So today was our…

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:51.093
first date, I think.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.970
In times of social media,

00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:55.723
he taught me to enjoy our story
at a different pace.

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.766
It's slower, more thoughtful.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.768
It's the K-drama pace.

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:07.901
I haven't been in a moment like this
for a long time.

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.240
- Oh!
- Mwah!

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.747
Excuse me, do I know you?

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.290
No, sorry, someone's waiting.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:23.834
Hello!

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.627
- Hello!
- Hello, hello!

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.671
How are you? Are you cold?

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.423
I mean, it's fine. It's a bit windy,

00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.050
- but it's a beautiful weather.
- Yeah.

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:33.761
- So, this is Namsan.
- Okay!

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.429
- Have you been here?
- No, never.

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:40.142
Okay! You see there, you see all the…
the… What do you call them? Locks?

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.769
- The locks.
- You heard about the locks?

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:44.855
Yes, I've heard about it.
It's a thing in Brazil, actually.

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:46.732
- It is?
- Everybody knows about it. Yes.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:49.276
- How about the one here?
- How many hearts have you put there?

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:52.905
If you see all the red, that's mine.

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:54.114
All the red. That's mine.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.824
Is it possible to get a locker here?

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.785
- You can buy one…
- But only for couples, right?

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.828
- Yeah. So we gotta… We gotta think.
- Oh…

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.997
Hmm… Hmm…

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:05.417
Maybe if you act well,
then I'll be like, "Okay, okay, Mari."

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.503
I'm just kidding.

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.213
- Okay.
- You want to go see the locks here?

00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:11.715
Let's go, let's take a walk. Yeah.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:14.259
Oh-- You-- Oh, your muscles.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.136
What's happening?

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.721
Of course, everything.

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:29.983
I came here thinking
I knew how my story would end.

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:32.694
But in a wild plot twist of fate,

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.405
I had to put an end to the Jack chapter.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.033
We'll be just friends.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.619
Babe, no, don't cry, it happens.

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.996
Girl, it's normal.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.500
I had to turn that page.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:50.963
And this time, I won't even try
to guess how this story will go.

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:52.422
But I think it will be good.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.342
I haven't had
this much fun in a long time.

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:00.097
It was good. I enjoyed it.

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:18.866
Fairytale happy endings
don't really exist.

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:24.204
And in real life, you feel
when a cycle ends and another begins.

00:19:30.627 --> 00:19:32.296
Hey! All good?

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.006
- How are you?
- I'm good.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:37.009
- For you.
- Oh, thank you!

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.142
Wow, you are a cutie!

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.476
You look very beautiful.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.353
Oh, thank you very much!

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.941
You know, I had only seen this in shows,
in K-dramas.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.737
- And coming here has been a dream.
- Ah.

00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:59.406
It's a very famous place
for romantic dates.

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:01.533
Oh, that's amazing!

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:04.369
Well, then, it's very nice
to come here with you.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:08.582
And have you brought
anyone else here before?

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:09.875
No, never.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.418
My first time here, and it's with you.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:15.589
You're a really special person, Katy.

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:18.467
So, being here now
is really special to me.

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.510
I consider it an honor.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:27.726
Have you ever been to Namsan Tower?

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:34.233
Yeah, I've been to Namsan Tower before,
and I put a lock there with my friends.

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:37.194
But I've never done that with a boyfriend.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.529
Mm. You can go with me next time.

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:40.948
Yeah, let's go.

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:44.660
It'll be really romantic
to put our little lock on Namsan Tower.

00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:49.581
Okay, let's get going?

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.166
Let's go, yeah, we can go.

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:07.808
Legend says that
if you lock a padlock on Namsan Tower

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.726
and throw away the key,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.937
your love lasts forever.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.773
Or at least until the next K-drama starts.

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:16.733
But one thing is certain.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.861
If there hasn't been a kiss,
it means it's not over yet.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.863
Oh, look at this huge one.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.700
- Whoa, this is huge one.
- This is… medieval!

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:28.120
This is like… this is love.
This is true love.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:32.416
Did you brought… Did you brought us one?

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:34.167
- Us?
- Yeah-Yeah.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.044
- For our friendship!
- Oh yeah.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:42.384
- Look at this field.
- Look at this view!

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.177
Oh my God!

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.429
Welcome to Seoul.

00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:47.806
- Oh!
- Now we finally see the whole view.

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:52.185
Where the… Where the sun hits
is your kingdom.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.482
Yeah. Oh, it's so pretty. Like, uh…
For me, I haven't come here in so long.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.359
- Really?
- Yeah, it's great.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.694
Danny, I need to talk to you.

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:01.820
What?

00:22:01.903 --> 00:22:04.281
Because, um…

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:06.992
I'm gonna be leaving, um, soon…

00:22:07.075 --> 00:22:09.911
- Mm-hmm.
- In-In a few days, right?

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.376
We had a lot of great moments
the last few days.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.254
- Of course.
- And…

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:25.761
you told me few things
that I think I won't forget.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.306
- But--
- Everything we did in Korea…

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:32.476
What-What…
It flew by really fast, to be honest.

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.852
- Mm.
- I think.

00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:35.437
I wish there was more time.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.612
Sorry about my bad Korean, but…

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.823
What do you want from me?

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:49.785
What do you want?

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.244
What do I want?

00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:53.246
Yeah. What should I do
with all this information?

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.582
Where'd you learn that?
Where'd you learn that?

00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:58.293
- Uh, I know a little bit of Korean.
- You do?

00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.211
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:01.463
- I mean, I guess today--
- Yeah… You mean--

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:04.466
Yeah, today's the day,
I mean, that we have to talk.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:06.176
Like…

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.561
Like-Like I said before. Like…

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:21.983
I wouldn't have brought you
on so many dates, I would say,

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.610
if I didn't have feelings.

00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:26.113
Of course, because why would I, you know?

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.198
It takes time and energy.

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:35.288
Have you ever really thought about distant
relationships and the downside of it?

00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.125
Always.

00:23:38.708 --> 00:23:39.626
Now…

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:41.294
I like taking risks,

00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:44.631
and I already had the distance
relationship. You know about it.

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:47.926
And it's hard. I know.

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.303
Should-Should-Should we let this go?

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.300
Wow!

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.388
- Saúde!
- Saúde!

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:38.727
Mm!

00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:41.605
- It's good?
- That's delicious!

00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:43.231
This is really good!

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:47.527
Mmm.

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:49.988
- Like it?
- Really good. Mm-hmm.

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:51.740
Mm.

00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:54.910
Mmm.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:56.745
I…

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.371
Uh…

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:00.332
You know, I…

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.918
like women who have dreams.

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:05.629
Women who are…

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:09.174
serious about their dreams,

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:13.512
who fight for them, set goals,
and go after them. I like that.

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:16.264
Oh, so you just described me.

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.936
The ideal guy for me…

00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:24.147
is… It's not just about looks.

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:27.776
It's also someone who is
going after their dreams,

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.695
who wants to do something with his life.

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.156
And who is fun.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:38.161
So, talking to you, I can see
that you tick all those boxes too.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:40.288
So we've found our perfect match.

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:46.127
Oh yeah, my heart beats faster,

00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:49.089
especially when you smile.

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:57.180
To be honest, I'm not the kind of person
who expresses their feelings, Katy.

00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:59.391
But after I met you,

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:02.644
you… made me open myself up.

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.813
You have this power, Katy.

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.982
Well, then you should
look deeper into my eyes

00:26:07.065 --> 00:26:08.775
to feel more butterflies in your stomach.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:15.240
Of course, I'd like to have
more physical contact with you.

00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:18.952
Of course I would.
But I want to be gentle with you.

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.871
I want to respect you.

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:24.958
This is what I do in my relationships.

00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:25.917
This…

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.212
is why I've been keeping my distance.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.425
I hope you understand that.

00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:35.302
And I promise I'll keep trying.

00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:40.056
Did I sound boring with all…

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.683
all that talk?

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:45.478
Thanks for understanding me, Katy.

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:47.647
Yeah.

00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:55.572
Now I know I don't have to dive
headfirst into a story

00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:57.407
in order to be the star of it.

00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:21.598
So this view is, like,
the downside of Seoul, I guess.

00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:22.974
Yeah.

00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:28.229
Thank you for introducing me
to this amazing city.

00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:34.027
Also, thank you so much
for being so patience… patient and kind.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.236
And…

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.782
Thank you for like…

00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:42.452
having me over.

00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:48.500
I really feel like we really connected
to each other in the last few days, and…

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.003
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.296
Yeah. I mean…

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.055
Thank you. I mean…

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:06.142
Thank you for spending
your precious time here in South Korea.

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:11.231
Maybe we can do some of this next time.

00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:13.858
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:16.152
Can we…

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:17.946
Hm?

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:31.459
I like it.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:38.758
Danny.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.969
Yes. Mari.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.930
I really wanna do something right now.

00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:02.866
I really wanted to do that.

00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:12.500
I feel like a kid right now
that just did something wrong.

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:17.922
In K-dramas, the kiss is
the perfect ending to the story.

00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:24.262
But for me, it's just the culmination
of a story that was felt,

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.139
but not yet written.

00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:43.114
- We'll see each other again.
- You promise that?

00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.366
- It's a pinky promise?
- Yeah.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.869
- Are we really gonna see each other again?
- Yep.

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:50.872
I don't know to do this stuff.
I'm just like…

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:54.042
- moving my thumb right now…
- Yeah, but my, um…

00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:14.562
But thank you so much.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:22.070
Our trip may be coming to an end, but

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:24.697
everything we experienced here…

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:26.866
Ah, this will definitely
go down in history.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.992
It's very well lit.

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.745
Look at this vibe,
look at this view, guys.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:32.664
The moon.

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:34.749
It's smiling at us today.

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:45.051
Hi!

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.136
Luanny.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.055
Camila!

00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.268
music continues]

00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.899
Remember?
The first time I gave you flower.

00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:09.951
Guys, what about there?

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.996
Wow, everyone!

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.998
Whoa!

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.421
Let's all stand up.

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:27.176
So I invited all girls
to be our bridesmaids.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.513
Yeah, so let's make cheers.

00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:31.681
- It's good?
- Good!

00:31:31.764 --> 00:31:36.311
Cheers!

00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.959
It's good that you came
and you got to meet my friends.

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:02.045
All of them are very beautiful,

00:32:02.128 --> 00:32:03.046
but Katy is…

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:05.548
the most beautiful.

00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.300
I'm always the prettiest.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.803
I have to tell you something.

00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.597
I went to meet my mother-in-law.

00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:14.682
And then? Did you?

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.185
And then…

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.354
She said she has a new granddaughter now.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.689
- Oh my God!
- What?

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.107
- How beautiful!
- You're kidding!

00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.943
And that she's very happy.

00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:27.737
Amazing!

00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:35.036
And she said I didn't need to be afraid,
because having a child is not a problem.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:37.497
- That's great! Halleluiah!
- That a child is a blessing.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.082
And that she still loves me.

00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:44.504
That's good news. That's-That's… Wow!

00:32:44.587 --> 00:32:45.672
My God, Danny!

00:32:45.755 --> 00:32:47.423
Now, look!

00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.718
No, no.

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:52.887
Now you buy one for her.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:53.846
Yes!

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.056
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah!

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.432
Can we get married now?

00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:57.850
Give me my ring.

00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:00.353
Yeah she wants now.

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.357
We are so happy for you, babe.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.692
I'm so happy too!

00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:09.237
Guys, I also have something to tell.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.072
- Mm!
- We went to Namsan Tower.

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.282
- Oh!
- For the first time.

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:18.121
Yeah, it's like a postal card of Korea.
So amazing, so beautiful, right?

00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:23.793
And it's so romantic, the ambiance there,
and it was amazing, right?

00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:24.919
Yes.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.587
Do you kiss her? You kissed her?

00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:29.507
- The first kiss then?
- Oh…

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.508
Y-yes!

00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:34.470
Danny! Danny! Danny!

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:38.349
Danny! Danny! Danny!

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:40.059
Kiss again.

00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:41.644
No, no.

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.438
- I want to see that.
- Let's dance!

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.815
Great idea.

00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:52.947
Do it like this.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:06.627
Are you okay?

00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:11.007
You made a wish when you came…

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:12.884
A wish?

00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:15.219
- Yeah.
- In Cheonggyecheon.

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.638
- Hmm?
- You tossed a coin, right?

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:25.188
In Cheonggyecheon, I wished
for my friends to have a good time here.

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:28.941
- Spend the time here?
- Mm?

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.277
I wished for the girls…

00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:33.571
A good time here,

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:37.408
and we go back to Brazil.

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.123
I feel like crying.

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.416
Oh, so sad.

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:49.545
Weren't you crying just now?

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:51.089
I cried a lot.

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.299
I don't usually cry.

00:34:58.221 --> 00:34:59.806
When you're in Brazil,

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:01.933
DM me.

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:04.435
- What?
- DM. Insta DM.

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.649
Oh…

00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:25.331
What if you meet someone
cooler than me? No?

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:28.793
So sad.

00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:35.341
You met a lot of people.

00:35:37.009 --> 00:35:41.597
Who are probably pretty similar.
And you're a good person.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.349
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:44.517
I'm crazy.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.811
- Oh no!
- I'm a little crazy.

00:35:46.894 --> 00:35:47.979
Oh, a little?

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:49.605
Uh-huh.

00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:54.610
When you go back to Brazil,
you'll remember your country, right?

00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:58.573
Will you remember me?

00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:00.366
- You?
- Yeah.

00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:06.789
I'm glad you came here, Camila,
and that I got to meet you.

00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:19.010
Have a safe trip back.
And let's keep in touch.

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.847
Bye. Yeah.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.141
- Oh, this Braz-Brazil.
- Brazil way?

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:26.350
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:29.562
Bye.

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:38.946
I came here to put an end
to a long chapter of my life.

00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:44.452
To start over,
some stories need to come to an end.

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:48.623
And a new chapter doesn't always
have room for someone new.

00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:09.393
Bring me that sparkly drink!
Twinkle, twinkle, babe!

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.416
The worst part of the trip…

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:33.793
Is leaving, right?

00:37:33.876 --> 00:37:35.253
…is when it's over.

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.630
It went by so fast, right?

00:37:37.713 --> 00:37:39.048
But it was so intense.

00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:40.716
It was. What we experienced here--

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.387
Oh my God, my little duck.
A happy family reunited.

00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.848
- What does it mean? I never understood.
- I'm afraid of breaking it.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.352
It's a symbol because
ducks never separate from each other.

00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:55.856
So, Su-woong and I will never split up.

00:37:56.649 --> 00:38:00.945
We came to Korea to find out
if K-dramas exist in real life.

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.865
I'm sure that they do.

00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:09.870
I prefer to tell my story another way.

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.917
For me, it's a mix of different things.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.545
I'm going to miss that too.

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.671
Waking up, Morena,

00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:21.632
and you being there at the counter
already waiting for me with coffee.

00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:22.591
Oh, okay.

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:25.386
- So we can gossip about life.
- Wow, this is so heavy.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.762
Damn, the suitcase is heavy.

00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:28.264
It wasn't like that, huh?

00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:30.975
- What's in there? It wasn't like that.
- Let me put the bag here.

00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:32.351
Hey, Luanny!

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.395
Let's go. The car is here.

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.105
Let's go, Lu.

00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:37.815
I'm not going with you guys.

00:38:37.898 --> 00:38:39.108
What?

00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:42.820
Si-won is picking me up. I'm going
to spend more time here in Korea.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.074
- Why?
- Are you serious?

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:50.911
After I met his mom, I wanted to learn
more about his family and about him.

00:38:51.787 --> 00:38:53.456
I think I'll stay a little longer.

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.124
Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you.

00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:56.167
Give me a hug!

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:58.377
Group hug. Everyone together!

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.885
Guys, let's go, or we'll miss the car.

00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:09.055
Yeah, we'll miss
the car, the flight, everything.

00:39:09.138 --> 00:39:12.767
- You better text us, okay?
- Yeah, send us a message. Bye, Lu.

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.312
- Send us a text. God bless.
- Thank you for this experience.

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:24.153
With or without a K-drama,
I believe in love.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.410
THREE MONTHS LATER

00:39:35.122 --> 00:39:37.708
