{\an8}A NETFLIX SERIES

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.925
{\an8}MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND
REACT

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.721
Oh, Rafa, that blonde
girl is suffering a lot.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.598
Yeah, she totally is. I really
feel for her. It's too much for me.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.600
I don't know if this is a
bit more common, like, asking--

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.102
Out of his mind. Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.439
{\an8}- They seem very lonely, so they date.
- Yeah, they don't even touch each other,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.773
only after they get married. I don't know.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.526
I want to-- I want to see who
will win now, like, in this--

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.902
- So--
- Who will beat who?

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:28.903
In this love.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.447
- Okay.
- You know?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.407
- I don't think they'll all win.
- Here comes trouble.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.868
- I want to see more, I'm excited.
- But I'm-- I still have

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.202
hope that we'll go to Korea.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.287
Let's see what happens.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.455
- Let's see, yeah?
- Let's see.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.167
I forgave you. Because I loved you.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.544
I don't know how I feel about you anymore.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.462
Anger.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.380
Awkward.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.590
Oh, wow.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.091
Oh, damn.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:53.303
I have this urge to grab
her and shake her.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.846
She's gonna break up with him.
There's no other way.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.389
- There's no other way.
- She has to find some strength and say,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.140
I think that the--

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:57.724
"Hey look--"

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:58.975
- There's no way.
- That--

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.810
- She's gonna take him back.
- Yeah.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.855
If you're going to stay together,
it's because you make each other happier.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:04.647
Oh, come on!

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.107
She's not going to buy it?

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.152
Wow, I'd take those flowers
and shove them up his nose.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.071
One little flower? Shove it up your butt!

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.615
Why the hell do Korean
guys give only one rose?

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:14.616
And it's this big!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.743
- So, guys--
- And it's all crumpled, smashed.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.369
Bring at least like-- I
mean twelve Colombian roses.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.831
Right!? I mean, he was like
apologizing for a bunch of screw-ups.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.584
Some picked from the street
would have been better.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:25.960
He shows up with just one.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.338
I mean he'd have more flowers.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.214
All crumpled in plastic.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.507
He'd have more to show.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.220
Just break up already!
Everyone goes their separate ways. Bye.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.180
We should go our separate ways.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.974
- Finally she stopped being crazy!
- Yeah, finally.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.520
- I hope she finds another guy.
- Peace out, buddy.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.523
- Oh my God in heaven.
- Take that damn flower with you.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.691
Don't leave that crap here.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.612
- He took that pretty easy, didn't he?
- Well done!

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:53.905
Yeah! Thank you, Lord!

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.032
- Wow. I'm happy, so happy.
- She crushed it.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.828
She may be crying, I'm not. But this is
her moment, it's understandable, because

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.996
- she's sad.
- Yeah, let it out.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.124
But if he's sad, then I'm happy.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.626
- Bu-bye, now.
- Good bye! Poor girl

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.379
- though. She was really into him.
- Oh, see ya.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.464
- Go with God.
- Siwon.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.675
Don't feel sorry for him,
Lô. Go home, son.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.926
Oh, no!

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:16.553
- Oh, get out of here!
- Oh, hell no!

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.388
- Oh, no way!
- You gotta be kidding!

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.850
- Oh, come on, girl! Get out of here!
- I need to get a pillow. I need to grab

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.102
- one so I can squeeze it like this, look.
- But why?

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.478
I mean? Damn.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.105
Just a hug, and it's over.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.274
- He can't even hug!
- Yuck.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.276
- My God.
- He's going like this.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.861
It's like he's hugging a pigeon.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:36.114
How can you believe a word that
comes out of that man's mouth?

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.282
Girl, use your head.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.534
Don't kiss him, girl. Don't do it.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.245
Now she goes after him, watch.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.621
- Oh, no, come on.
- She's going after him.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:44.664
Control yourself, woman.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.003
- What if I throw a pillow at her?
- I just can't!

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.172
Ugh, I can't believe she's
going back to that guy again.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:52.881
No.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.507
Oh, I'm embarrassed.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.886
It's like I'm watching a friend of
mine doing something stupid and I can't do

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.555
- anything, like, I can't help her.
- Can't do anything, right?

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.890
Oh, geez, it's so humiliating.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.183
How embarrassing, girl.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:07.061
Say what?! There's no future
together, man! Come on, seriously.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.813
If the present is already
bad, imagine the future.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:09.939
Alright, stop.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:10.773
Enough.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.610
It's like a rollercoaster of emotions
the whole time, right?

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.363
Whenever I think I've been made a fool of,
then I see something like this.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.743
- People, use your head!
- No, don't go, don't leave.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:22.869
Don't go.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.412
Please.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.667
He's like putting her down.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.086
It's the ppoppo guy.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.130
Oh, she went to his house.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:37.050
- Will he give her the ppoppo in the mouth?
- Welcome!

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.427
- Thank you.
- He's always well-dressed, right?

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.055
- Him?
- Oh, my God, let me take off my shoes.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.389
- He's chillin.
- Stylish.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.225
- He's wearing a tank top.
- Look, he's ripped.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.685
Looks like someone's a little jealous.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.355
He's gonna to cook for her.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.607
- Oh, those pants are gorgeous.
- Right?

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.526
- They're everything. A pancake.
- I--

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.946
- He looks good in them.
- Absolutely, honey.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.031
Cute little things.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:01.699
- Did you see it?
- That egg is for an omelet, right?

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.201
A big omelet.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.081
- Winning her over with food.
- Husband material.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.791
- Yeah.
- Guys, but it was cool,

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:10.750
I thought it was dope.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.335
She's so joyful. Full
of joy and dreams, right?

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.253
Yeah.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.338
Full of laughter and dreams.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.298
You wouldn't kiss someone that
you're not actually dating, like, in the

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:18.716
{\an8}- relationship.
- Yeah, love.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.720
How can you date someone without
knowing if they know how to kiss?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:23.680
- No.
- Wait, so you have to

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.223
- date before you can kiss?
- No, you should kiss to

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.599
find out if it's worth it.

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:29.435
You've already asked
to start dating them.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.689
Yeah, okay. That's why Koreans
date and break up a lot of times.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.984
Yeah. That's why they say,
"I have a lot of girlfriends."

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:36.985
So straight forward.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:37.819
So many exes too.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.154
But that's why they have a
lot of girlfriends and exes.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:40.947
That's right.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.116
I think she's like, fine with it all.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.659
No, not for long, Nicole.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.035
You think? But she's
on Eliana's finger song.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.744
Just wait.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.290
- She's calm, very cool.
- She's calm, but she's gonna lose it soon.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.916
- You really think so?
- The tension, she'll be

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.835
desperate. He's gonna suffer at her hands.

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:56.587
- It's all at once, it's gonna be bad.
- I think he's so in love with her.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.008
Oh, he's definitely into her. But
it's very different from our reality.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.759
But babe, they can't all suffer.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.053
- Someone has to be happy, right?
- Let's split the

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.179
suffering. Hold up, people.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.347
In a group of five,
someone has to be fine.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.099
- Someone has to find--
- Otherwise let's shut down

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.934
- Korea and we're out of here.
- Yeah, uh-huh, right.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:10.852
My God.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:11.936
I'm shocked.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.354
Oh, she went on a date.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.525
- Hi!
- She's in Friday mode. -Hello!

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:19.277
- It's happening.
- Hello.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.653
Nice to meet you.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:24.574
- Oh, you guys, that was so nice.
- He just melted my heart!

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.408
So cute.

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.035
They are very…

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.536
charming.

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.330
- He's committed.
- They have chemistry. Oh, yeah.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.331
You go, Camila!

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.290
Guys, Camila…

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.499
{\an8}is determined.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.296
{\an8}- He seems like a nice guy.
- He kinda looks like a friend of mine.

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:39.630
What?

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.424
{\an8}- For real.
- Dai is--

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:45.094
{\an8}I'm single, you guys. Not everyone
has a boyfriend. I'm still single.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.388
- Daiana-- She is interested.
- Her voice even got all pitchy.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.391
{\an8}- I'm looking for a serious relationship.
- You'll be in season two.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.477
- Oh, intestines? Oh, no.
- Oh, I'd be down, Nicole.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.562
Oh, you eat intestines? Oh God.

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:57.148
Honey, I've put all kinds of
things in my mouth, Nicole.

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.692
- Oh, babe. I'd rather lose the guy.
- Really?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.278
If I had to eat intestines. I'm not
eating at all! That's where the nasty

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.364
- stuff is, girl. Hell no.
- Hey, listen up, boys!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.824
{\an8}- It's a bit weird if you don't like it.
- No, it's appearance and the

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.243
- texture are weird, but the taste is--
- But in feijoada, everything goes in it.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.536
{\an8}I'm starting to get hungry.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.830
- But he's a sweetheart.
- Chill.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.165
- I mean, so far.
- Let's wait.

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:16.209
- He was… sweet, he was nice.
- You know? He was.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:17.752
- So, yeah. Guys, you see?
- He was a gentleman.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.670
Yeah, there are good people, but
there are bad people. That's it, yeah.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.506
- Like everywhere else.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.175
Yeah, cause not every Korean
is a prince charming, guys.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.844
- Because not all Koreans are--
- Not every Korean is a CEO,

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.596
- has money, or is good-looking.
- True.

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.515
- For real.
- But yeah, he is good-looking. He's more--

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.142
- He is good-looking.
- Sure. And bottom line, it's not about

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.562
going to the most expensive place, it's
about feeling special, feeling loved.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.939
Absolutely.

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:39.357
Having an ice cream
while walking on the beach?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.525
Yeah. That's beautiful.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.068
- She invited him to grab a bite.
- So beautiful, man.

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.945
Look, they're planning another date.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.571
{\an8}I think we have a match.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.535
Oh, she's gonna meet his mom.

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.287
- Oh, wow.
- Oh my God, this will be…

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.288
I'm shocked--

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.292
- Oh, honey, I'm curious about his mom.
- Me too. I want to see how she dresses,

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.711
- cause she talks about everyone's clothes.
- Yeah.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:01.504
I don't wanna look.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:03.881
That's his mom?

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.843
- Look, she's so chic!
- Oh, dear Lord!

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:08.928
Actually, not so much.

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:10.930
That lady is going to feel sick later.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:11.722
Uh-oh.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.433
{\an8}The sleeve up to here.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.185
He says it like it's no big deal.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.063
And I proposed to her.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:21.524
- Oh, mama.
- He says it like it's--

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:25.695
"So, I was on my way here, and I proposed
to her. What do you want to order today?"

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.446
Yeah.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.698
- No, but it's--
- He said it like it was nothing.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.616
Nothing? He set up
this lunch to tell her.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.454
Okay. But the way he told her was
like-- "Oh, yeah, we're getting married."

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.205
In Brazil? It's a 30-hour flight.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:37.748
Guys.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.209
The girl took a thirty
hour flight to see her love.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.627
Yeah, she can't go. The big diva
can't do it. Thirty hours on a plane.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.087
Don't you wanna see your son
getting married? What's up with that?

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:43.838
You know?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.007
Ah, if she doesn't want
to, she can stay there.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.757
Stay there.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.051
She's marrying your
son, you know, not you.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.678
Tension. What's in this letter?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.848
- "Leave your son with me and go away."
- "If you don't want me to get

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:55.600
married, that's your problem."

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:56.559
"You hear me?"

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:02.732
"And most of all, with such good
character like your son."

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.277
- The mother-in-law likes her already.
- She nailed it with the letter.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.445
Nice move.

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:10.656
Does his mom still have any
doubts that he likes her?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.283
Even I'm crying now.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:13.701
{\an8}Here, take this.

00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.165
Don't hug her, no, stop, no! No hug!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.709
- Please, stop!
- She looks like she's

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:23.294
never been hugged in her life.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.130
And Morena's already sitting on her lap.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.467
- She chose her words very well.
- There's no way she didn't love this.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.302
- Awesome.
- She made them all cry.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.221
- Yes please. Give to her.
- Go girl.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:34.931
No, that's how it's done, guys.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.391
- Oh, but she's going to--
- She was very polite, really

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.185
- beautiful, she really nailed it.
- Oh, I loved it.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.230
{\an8}You're taking your son on the altar.
Your daughter on the altar. You get

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.898
worried. You raised
them with so much love.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.483
- Totally.
- Yeah. And also he is gonna go

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:47.109
- live in another country, right?
- Exactly.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.486
I won't see my son very often.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.613
I'm not going to be part of his life.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:51.822
So I understand his mother.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.616
The wedding dress.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.452
- Wow, she's getting married there.
- I'm shocked. Floored.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.665
- He learned how to make the little heart!
- They taught us that, baby girl.

00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:01.791
- It was them?
- It's their thing.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:02.667
What?

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.460
I thought we taught them.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.503
Ah, I'm speechless.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.256
But that's bad luck.
He can't see the bride.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.761
"Damn, I really lost my son."

00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:17.640
- Oh, I hope he's a nice guy.
- Ah, single girl, looking for love.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.100
- Another one?
- So, Katy's going to try to

00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:20.601
- get another boyfriend, huh?
- She's gonna to try.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:21.519
Yeah.

00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:24.021
They look alike. They're kind
of similar, the two of them.

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.190
- Look, is that him?
- He kind of looks like an idol, right?

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.650
- See? Look.
- By the way he looks.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.485
He does look like an idol.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.486
{\an8}He really does.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.863
- Did you see how restrained they are?
- Yeah.

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:37.743
- Huh? Did she bring a gift?
- Oh, it's the headphones for translation.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.288
- This way can communicate better.
- She took the idea from her friend.

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.832
Oh, yeah, She took-- If you're
not gonna use them, hand them over.

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:43.583
Yeah.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.501
I went to fashion design school.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.255
- He complimented her, nice.
- In this short time together, she's

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:50.590
made more progress with this guy.

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.757
Who is Jack?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.884
- Where is Jack?
- Jack is gone.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.761
- Yeah, Jack who?
- Jack, where are you?

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.805
Who? Who are you talking about?
It's his turn now.

00:09:57.888 --> 00:09:58.639
Finally.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.391
He seems nice, doesn't he?

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.977
- I'm not sure it's going to work out.
- No need to get embarrassed. The girl

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.146
- is a little more forward than she seems.
- She's very direct.

00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:07.940
- I think he's more forward.
- He's already teaching

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.609
her to speak Korean.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.819
He's already teaching
her to drink heavily.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.779
I like him already.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.406
- I think that--
- I think this has more potential.

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:16.115
Hey--

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.450
- They totally hit it off.
- There is chemistry.

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:19.660
- With Jack it wasn't like this.
- She is very happy. Very true.

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.328
Yeah.

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:21.746
He's into her as well, look.

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:23.331
Would you like to try it?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.666
- Wow! I love that!
- Wow!

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.293
It worked out well!

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:31.464
Look, she put out the bait.
Now it's up to him to take it.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.132
Just give her the ppoppo already!

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:35.676
- Well, Ppoppo is different from kiseu.
- Come on!

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.802
- Yeah, that's true.
- Ppoppo is--

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.262
Ppoppo is just a peck.
Look, like this. Look.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.513
Yeah. Oh, a peck.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.765
- I think ppoppo is like that.
- And kiseu means "kiss",

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:41.807
you know? Like, more-- Yeah.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:42.933
- It's a real kiss, like a French kiss.
- A tongue kiss. There's tongue there.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.976
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I think there will be a

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.978
- little ppoppo on the cheek.
- I think more of a…

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:46.937
Come on man.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.022
That's it.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.024
Look. See?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.443
My God, it seems like another world.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.447
Nah, she's playing that little game
of hers, I know what she is getting at!

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.657
Wow, look at her face!

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.866
She's gonna say, "you
teach me, I'll teach you."

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:59.659
Yeah.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.952
Then you'll see the things
she'll be teaching him.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.955
- My God.
- My God, I loved it.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:05.748
Fierce.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:09.460
It made me feel like meeting a Korean
girl and seeing this shock firsthand,

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:10.419
you know?

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.755
- I know. It would be amazing.
- I would drive her crazy.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.674
She'd end up with her eyes rolled back.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.051
She's different from Mari,
isn't she? Mari would never.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.928
That's because she's,
like, thirsty for it, right?

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.429
- Trend.
- I think it's a light and water show.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.347
Yeah.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.517
- Where couples normally--
- Poor thing. Head over heels for him.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.977
- We're actually--
- This thing has gone up and

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.897
- down, and nothing has happened.
- Oh, no, she's all like,

00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.607
- "I'm begging you."
- "I'm begging you."

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.067
She keeps waiting like this.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:35.277
- Yeah, because-- For real.
- Waiting for him to make a

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.404
- move, "Come on, buddy. "
- But…

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.155
- It's beautiful.
- I'm out here-- Yes.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.865
- Yeah, it's beautiful. And I just want--
- Oh, honey!

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:40.866
Will they?

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.161
- Come on, kiss him, girl! Oh, my God!
- Oh, please!

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.579
- Go for the kiss.
- Come on.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.083
- Will they finally kiss?
- Please, come on.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.711
She can't take it
anymore, she's desperate.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:52.503
Wow.

00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.005
Look at her staring at his mouth,
dying to kiss him. She's like this, look.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.966
She wants to make out with him so bad.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.592
This is it.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.053
Go on, girl!

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:08.185
- For God's sake, they don't kiss!
- But what are they waiting for? She likes

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.563
him, and he's being super nice to her, you
know? Like--

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:14.483
He is. But did you see what she asked
him? "Is something going on between us?"

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.861
- Does a woman have to ask that?
- That's right.

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.071
Alright,
pay attention, they're gonna kiss.

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:21.532
- He's waiting for the right moment.
- Exactly.

00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:22.366
He is.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.452
- Yeah.
- I think they're gonna kiss when Mariana

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:26.912
grabs his face and says "Come here, Korean
boy. "

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.622
- Wait, what?
- Let's do it, then.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.082
Come here face.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.584
- "This is how you do it!"
- Give him a big ppoppo.

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.086
- I think she's gonna make the first move.
- No, I don't think so.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.298
No, I think she'll start to move
closer, then he'll move a little closer

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:38.466
- too.
- I think he'll--

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:39.925
Then she'll get even
closer and so will he.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.343
- Guys.
- I think he might be learning from

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.262
- her what Brazilian women are like.
- And be like this.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:45.347
Guys, he's taking her to the
middle of the bridge to kiss her!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.140
Making the first move.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.559
- Here comes a big ppoppo.
- Look at her face.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.645
If it doesn't happen willingly,
it'll be by force.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.607
- Will there be a kiss?
- I think he wants to.

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:56.817
- Let's have a look at the--
- Oh, my God.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.527
Look at what?

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.030
You've seen the
bridge three times already.

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.200
- Man, what a drag.
- In the middle of the bridge, that's it!

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.702
{\an8}He's looking at her. Look. Here.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:07.995
{\an8}- Yeah, he's waiting. Right there.
- He is staring at her a lot.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:09.330
He wants to make a
K-drama scene, you guys.

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.331
Look. He wants this.

00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:11.415
Ppoppo her!

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.419
Can't you hug someone when
it's cold? Oh, they're gonna kiss!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.712
Oh yeah, here it comes.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.005
- This kiss is finally gonna happen.
- Oh, please!

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:19.465
Oh, my God.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.051
Kiss already!

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.428
- Okay!
- Look, yes!

00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:26.806
- Oh, no!
- Oh, come on! Seriously!

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:27.765
What is that! No!

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:28.974
- Wait, chill, hold on.
- Wait.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.018
- She should learn from Katy.
- Oh, no!

00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:32.686
Why doesn't she go for it?

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.230
- Yeah!
- Pounce, girl!

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.690
Put his hand around your waist, girl.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:37.817
Oh, my God.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.987
- He's dodging her and she wants to do it!
- I think it's gonna happen.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.697
- Totally, exactly.
- It has to happen.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:46.617
Oh, I'm so mad!

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.870
I want to explode, guys!

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:52.706
- I thought they were finally gonna kiss!
- It just unbelievable.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.083
Oh, my sweetest friend!

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.794
She was like those rag dolls
that shake from side to side.

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:57.878
- For real.
- Look.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:13:59.547
Geez.

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:02.216
What's going on? A kiss on the cheek?

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.593
Did he just friendzone
me? Is that what happened?

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:05.594
Guys, I'm shocked.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.349
For God's sake, my man!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.394
- You didn't like it! You're lying, girl.
- Yeah, she wanted to.

00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:16.063
You hated it! You
wanted to suck his face!

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.857
- She did.
- You tell her, Marcia.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.484
I can't believe the show will
end and they won't have kissed.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:21.110
Be careful.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.487
Careful with what?
We're not going skydiving.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.656
- Exactly. Even if you were, honey.
- Got it? Yeah?

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.658
Is this the real-life K-drama?

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:29.702
But the women are awesome, they're
like-- On it. They're trying, but the guys

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:30.870
- aren't.
- They are, for sure.

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:34.540
But Mari could speak up more, you know?
She's being respectful, I get it.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:37.084
- I understand, but--
- She should be respectful to herself too.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.836
She's already going past her limit of--

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.087
- Patience?
- I think it's almost time

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.297
for her to go home, right?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.966
I mean, back in the day,
it really used to take a longer.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:45.718
Okay? Back in the day.

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:49.471
- But, nowadays, Korea is also becoming--
- Then came color TV,

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.057
- and people, right? Like--
- Yeah, you know?

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.727
- Brazilians started to spread.
- Yeah, it's like that. I know.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.813
- But now there's globalization.
- Nowadays, I know people who live over

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.148
- there and I see they kiss on the first, on
- the second date. You know?

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.482
Right, but there's still a lot of
people who follow these rules.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.400
Yeah.

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:04.445
- Ah, poor thing. I can't--
- We grow up believing that

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:05.529
every story has a happy ending.

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.530
Here she comes.

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.033
She went alone? Where's the boy?

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:13.203
- Wow, that guy is worthless.
- He left her alone with her mother-in-law?

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.372
It's better… better
alone than in bad company.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.832
Better alone than in bad company.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:17.625
Got it?

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:19.835
Don't be like Luana,
who is in bad company.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:20.961
For God's sake.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:21.921
Oh, my God.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.881
What's she gonna ask?

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.883
"How much do you owe?"

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.635
Yeah. Do you think so?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.886
This is it.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.721
She's gonna tell her about her daughter.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.639
Yeah.

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.349
- Oh my lord.
- Suppose I have a daughter,

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.392
would that be a problem for you two?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.022
That is not how you
break the news, honey.

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.774
- Oh, my God.
- Damn.

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:44.860
That's sweet.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.321
- The son didn't take after her.
- She just had to tell her.

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:48.614
That's all she had to do, simple.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:50.240
He didn't take after his mother,
unfortunately.

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:52.409
See that? She's way happier
with the mother than with the son.

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.786
- For real.
- That's so true, she feels more

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:56.997
- at ease with the mother-in-law.
- With the mother-in-law than--

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.500
He messes up so much with
such a cool mother like that?

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:00.417
She spoke beautifully.

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.628
{\an8}- Yeah, imagine if she were a--
- Do you think he'll

00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:03.587
{\an8}stop messing things up?

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.672
He won't.

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:06.882
I think, like, we're now seeing this

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.969
other side he has too,
right? Because of his mom.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:13.097
His mom is making me see him in
different light. I was so mad at him,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.139
- honey.
- True.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.182
I felt the same way.

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:16.350
- You too?
- Now I wish she were

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:17.476
dating his mom instead of him.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:18.519
- And the--
- The--

00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:21.355
If the mother-in-law were against it,
I'd be too, but since she wasn't.

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:24.316
Wow, that was so sweet! That
conversation was so beautiful, guys.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.567
It was. Mama knows best.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.946
- Oh, yeah.
- I love this couple.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:30.155
Ah, he's so sweet.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.783
- She did go to meet him.
- Hey, coffee would totally win me over.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:33.951
Oh, she's having a ball.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.953
That girl, honey. She's like--

00:16:36.036 --> 00:16:38.622
- She's really enjoying Korea.
- She solved her trauma, now she's

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.541
- like, "I want to enjoy life, darling."
- Yeah.

00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:42.626
- Cheers.
- Wow, he's tall, huh?

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.837
- Or she's really short.
- She's also petite.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.046
Nope, he's huge.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.965
- Wow, he's so big.
- Yeah, really big.

00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:48.966
Damn!

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:52.052
- I thought he was standing on a ladder.
- He plays basketball.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.763
Me to anyone,
"Your leg is longer than mine!"

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.768
- Ah! Yeah, I know! This in Brazil--
- Oh, it's a fan.

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:02.980
- Oh, nice move, real nice, classy.
- Nice move. Baller.

00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:04.815
I have to say, congratulations.

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.817
- It's not a "too much" gift.
- But it's kind of like--

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.945
But it's a little treat that
shows he thought about her.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.822
- Yeah.
- Because of the heat and all.

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:15.034
- Oh, they're sweet, aren't they?
- Very sweet.

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:18.412
- I'm rooting for them. She's, uh--
- And I mean, he's into her, you know?

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:22.166
- More straight forward.
- And she's also a-- A--

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:22.875
She is.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.334
I think I like her.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.339
She's starting to give
herself a chance to enjoy life.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.132
Yeah, she is.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:33.844
To me, she's the one who enjoyed
this trip the most, in a deeper way.

00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.763
Yeah, the whole trip.

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.681
- Exactly. She had fun, too.
- And made things lighter, without so

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.892
- much pressure, without so much urgency.
- Exactly.

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:42.311
Yeah, cause she understands that her
happiness isn't given by someone else.

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:43.812
- It's within herself.
- Wow, Nicole!

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.397
Yeah, that's it!

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.902
Not every love story needs to end in
love between two people. Sometimes…

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:50.861
it's self-love.

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:52.029
That's deep.

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:55.949
And some say that Mari is still
waiting for a ppoppo from her guy.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.702
Oh, yeah. The ppoppo
that'll never happen.

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:00.662
Speak of the devil.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.165
There will be a kiss. There's
got to be. She has to kiss him.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.124
A bit of affection.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.292
How can that be a sin?

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.212
- There has to be a kiss.
- How are you? Are you cold?

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.672
- I mean, it's fine.
- Look what she's doing.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:14.051
- She's loving the K-drama.
- She's living her K-drama. It's all good.

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:15.803
She's so in it.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.554
Do you see there?
Do you see all the-- The--

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.557
- What do you call them?
- Look. There. Yup. Okay. Come on.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.517
Oh, wow!

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.435
How many hearts have
you already put there?

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:26.438
- If you see all the red? That's mine.
- Mine must be there, too.

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.232
Look at my padlock over there.

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:29.858
There's yours.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.318
- Look at that little pink one.
- It's over there, thank you.

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:34.238
- Which one's yours?
- Is yours there, Isabella?

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:34.863
Yours is too?

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:35.531
- Was a heart.
- Yeah.

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.990
I thought it was a love spell.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.283
What are you saying?

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:41.620
Yeah? But it's the same thing.
You write someone's name and lock it.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:43.580
What for?

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:44.873
Everyone has their own point of view.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.376
- He likes to take her on walks, to see--
- Man, does he like to walk. Jesus.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.920
"So, this is the tourist
spot--" Ugh, I'm tired of that.

00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:51.797
I'm gonna grab a bite.

00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:54.466
- Oh, my God, my friend.
- No!

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.759
Just leave, girl!

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:57.344
Stop stalling!

00:18:58.011 --> 00:18:58.720
Get on with it!

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.223
Finally see the whole view.

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:05.227
- He loves panoramic views, my God.
- Where's the-- Where's the-- Sun?

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.688
She's not helping, either.
She's not helping herself.

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:08.730
She's not helping either.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.439
Go, Mari!

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.608
- Wow, what is this?
- It's so risky. They invest all this

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.361
time in someone, and then when it's time
to kiss-- There's just no chemistry.

00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:17.197
You-- You have to fight just to get a
kiss. -Wow, you have to humiliate yourself

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:18.782
and ask, "please, I beg
you, a kiss, please!"

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:19.575
"One kiss!"

00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:20.868
Kiss they boy!

00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:22.578
Kiss her already, man!

00:19:24.037 --> 00:19:25.038
Way to go.

00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:28.709
- Slay!
- I think he wants to be friends.

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.210
- Yeah.
- What for?

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:31.712
- To keep giving ppoppos on the cheek?
- Show her panoramic views?

00:19:31.795 --> 00:19:33.714
It's cause he's afraid of the
long-distance thing, you know?

00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:35.716
If he really wanted to, he wouldn't be.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.844
The other guy wanted it, and made it work.

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:40.470
What more do you want? Go!

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.431
She's just staring at his mouth.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:46.476
- Kiss him, girl! See, he looks away.
- Steal a kiss from him, at least!

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:52.566
Poor thing, nothing's gonna happen?
Wow, I'd be so pissed.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.652
I could have been hooking up with
other guys, but I wasted my time with him.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:56.361
Yeah.

00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:58.655
I really want to do something right now.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.115
Do it, baby girl!

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.035
- She's going to kiss him on the--
- He's about to call the police.

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.244
- Oh my God.
- She's gonna try.

00:20:04.828 --> 00:20:06.330
- Kiss, yeah!
- Someone has to do it. Come on, honey!

00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:08.123
Come on,
my boy. Let's do this. Ppoppo on the lips.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.584
- A big montage is coming.
- Here comes the ppoppo, everyone.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:11.460
What if he says "no"?

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.881
I'd go to the airport and wait
until it was time to go home.

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:16.924
Oh Lord.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.133
This is it.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.555
- He pulled away!
- Oh! You guys!

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.349
His face! No. Come on!

00:20:25.432 --> 00:20:26.725
They bumped teeth.

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:28.810
- My Godness.
- I was afraid he'd laugh and his gums

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.771
would be bleeding, because she went in so
hard!

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.231
A kiss. That kiss was very--

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.982
- It was bad. So painful.
- No vibe at all.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.484
He pulled away, and froze, look.

00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:37.277
- And then--
- Holy shit.

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:40.530
- I really wanted to do it!
- They're like little kids. When you

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.449
- kiss for the first time, you know?
- So true.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:45.494
Then, she kissed him on the lips,
and he looked like a sack of potatoes.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.579
- He pulled away, he backed away.
- Like this.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.957
- Oh, stop it, it was just a peck.
- Stop, please.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.459
- No, she hit him in the mouth.
- And when he went…

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.546
- He looked like one of those toys.
- Wow.

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.007
- Oh, come on, stop.
- The hurt… I think he

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.260
- didn't like it, you know?
- I think you're right.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.844
I thought they were cute.
Even though it was so slow.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.846
I didn't find anything cute. Not at all.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.266
- Sorry.
- Cause they're too slow for you, maybe?

00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:09.935
Now Camila.

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:11.561
Oh, I love her.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.230
Me too.

00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.564
What do you think?

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:15.983
I think he's very cute.

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:17.901
No, I'm talking about…

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.028
Right, sure. But like, to me he is--

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.155
Why am I already, you know--

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.826
Why do I think I have a crush on him?
Everything he does is cute!

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.078
I'm talking about them
as a couple, you know.

00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:31.331
Camila is playing hard to get,
guys. She's not making it easy for him.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.332
She is, yeah.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:33.250
Okay?

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.046
Man, she's so friendly, so empathetic.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.548
She didn't make it about herself.

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.468
- So sad.
- Oh, man.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.512
- Oh, you guys.
- Don't say those things.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:49.141
And a new cycle may not always
have room for someone new.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.684
Crushed it.

00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:52.227
- What a beautiful quote.
- Yeah, but--

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.645
I'm gonna start quoting her, for real.

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.857
Wow, she's so evolved! She's awesome.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.359
- Wow, that's tough.
- She was trying to get

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.777
over someone by going there.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:04.448
It's not about forgiving, but more about
freeing yourself from that cycle. So, I…

00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:05.324
Yeah, to move on.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.367
- I think that was more important to her.
- Yeah.

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:08.577
Moving on with her life.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.870
When she gets to Brazil--

00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:11.705
- A little DM on Instagram, you know?
- DM!

00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.999
"Camila,
if you need a shoulder to cry on."

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:17.794
- Wow, this suitcase is so heavy.
- When I travel, my

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:19.463
suitcases are like that, or worse.

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.340
- I'm not going with you guys.
- Let's go, girl!

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:23.258
- Siwon is coming to pick me up.
- I'm going to stay here

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:24.009
What?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.178
In Korea a little longer. -What?

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.430
- Yeah, girl! You go, Luanny!
- Love it!

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.306
Luanny!

00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:32.184
- Be happy, Lu!
- Very good!

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:34.936
Guys, talk about a plot twist, seriously.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.772
- I wasn't expecting that.
- The beginning and the

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:37.689
end, totally different.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.275
- Oh my God, she stayed!
- I'm shocked, blown away. She really

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.902
wants this. She gonna go all the way.

00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:44.738
Because now she's going to
live with him, literally.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:45.739
And his family.

00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:46.656
Without her friends.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.867
Oh, you have a point.
Without anyone influencing her.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.078
- Got it?
- Now they're going to get closer.

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.954
It'll be worse. She's on
her own. No one to warn her.

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.122
- Yeah, we don't know.
- It's gonna be…

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.208
If anything happens, tell her to call us.

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.459
- We'll recue her.
- Yeah.

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.294
- What else does she need?
- Hey, guys, let's go, or

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.420
- we'll miss our flight.
- Yeah,

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:01.713
we'll miss the car, we'll miss the flight.

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:05.467
They're gonna come back looking for a
carnival party so they can kiss everyone.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.636
They'll go straight to
the carnival in Salvador.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.470
My God, they will.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.139
- Oh my goodness.
- My God.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.557
Three months later, huh?

00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:15.310
{\an8}Oh, that's really cool.

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.354
{\an8}- They got married.
- It's in Brazil!

00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:19.231
- I can't believe it!
- Look at that! It's a

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:21.775
- wedding! Who could it be?
- Belo Horizonte. No! Oh, look!

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.902
Look, the mother-in-law is
there. She's actually there!

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:24.986
His mom came to the
wedding! That's so cool!

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.239
She came to Brazil,
despite the thirty hour flight.

00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:28.156
Oh! The mother-in-law!

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:31.785
- Incredible!
- Go, Morena!

00:23:33.453 --> 00:23:34.621
- I love it!
- Oh, they're cute

00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:35.956
together. They deserve it.

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:37.666
- Oh my God.
- I think we should make

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:38.792
- a toast too, come on.
- I like that!

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.127
- A toast to us.
- Yeah, let's do it.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.336
Here's to love.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.921
Here's to Morena, who
really got it right.

00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:43.630
Long live Morena.

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.424
We were rooting for
her from the beginning.

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.092
- Long live love.
- You can see it's true love.

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:48.510
What a beautiful family!

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:49.928
- Beautiful, moving. It's touching.
- You can almost picture

00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:51.054
their kids running around.

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:52.431
Not everyone found
love over there, right?

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:56.143
Not everything worked out for some of
the girls. But they have a story to tell.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:59.271
Sometimes it's romantic love, but
sometimes it's self-love, like Camila.

00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:01.773
And sometimes you can love
someone as a friend, you know?

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.608
The key is to travel with
your friends, and never--

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:04.568
With your girl friends.

00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:06.194
- Shall we go?
- Stop believing.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.405
- Are you up for it?
- I'm so up for it.

00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:09.614
- With arms intertwined?
- Cheers.

00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:10.991
- Shall we do it?
- Like this?

00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:11.700
Yeah.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.076
- It's a bit tricky, isn't it?

Oh my God. Oh my God. What are we doing?

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.580
- To My Korean Boyfriend.
- To My Korean Boyfriend!

00:24:16.663 --> 00:24:17.789
To My Korean Boyfriend.

00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:21.835
