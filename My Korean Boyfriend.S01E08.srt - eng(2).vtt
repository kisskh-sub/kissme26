WEBVTT

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.633
{\an8}Flight 3321 to Seoul--

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:09.843
{\an8}Wow…

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.345
{\an8}The camera is catching my butt, for sure.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.347
- …fasten your seatbelts…
- Those are comfy, right?

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.558
- Time for My Korean Boyfriend!
- Oh, no way, wow!

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.518
- All good?
- Hey, how are you?

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.146
- Oh, no shoes inside a Korean home.
- Please.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.399
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND: REACT

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.109
{\an8}You said it, girl!

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.777
{\an8}Stop being crazy.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.154
{\an8}I would be her friend.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.613
{\an8}Oh, beautiful!

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.492
{\an8}- Don't do that!
- You felt the Korean flavor.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.995
{\an8}Oh, slay! I can't believe it.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.621
{\an8}- Okay.
- That was beautiful!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.748
Do you like K-dramas?

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.709
I think they're dope,
I love the Korean universe in general.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:43.626
MY KOREAN BOYFRIEND

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.129
- I'm already in love.
- Ever gone too far to chase a man?

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.508
- Who hasn't, right?
- Who hasn't, honey? I'd go to Mars.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:51.885
- If I fall in love--
- Exactly.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.053
But if I'm not in love,

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:56.514
I won't even travel
to the nearest neighborhood to see them.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.559
- He has to be good.
- But if he's good, you can keep going--

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.645
- Then we go to Mars, we go far away.
- Like those girls who ended up in Korea.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.563
I'm shook!

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.815
The thing is, I always root for couples.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.442
Ah…

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.110
- I'm super excited.
- Me too.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.196
- You are?
- I am ready to talk a lot.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.822
Would I make a good Korean boyfriend?

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.449
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.950
Oh. Have you ever dated a Korean?

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.368
No, have you? Have you?

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.787
A Korean woman.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.704
No.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.164
- Never?
- Never.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.666
- It must be an experience, right?
- Yeah.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.626
We'll see soon enough.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.294
Attention…

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:28.505
- Let's do this!
- …passengers bound for Seoul.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.423
- Seoul?
- It's far.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.259
- My skincare routine is all Korean.
- So is mine.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:38.556
Boarding has now begun
for the My Korean Boyfriend experiment.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.975
- Oh, slay!
- It's starting, Nicole!

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.853
Wow, will she let us
experiment with her boyfriend?

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.147
- No, that girl--
- Bring us two!

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.524
{\an8}I want a second date…

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.692
{\an8}- Yeah…
- These are the girls, aren't they?

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:51.903
{\an8}Oh, poor girl.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.697
{\an8}Whoa…

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.366
{\an8}That's the kind of thing you should tell.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.826
{\an8}It takes courage.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.163
{\an8}Yeah. I don't even have the guts to leave
my neighborhood to go on a date.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.541
{\an8}- They were already together.
- Check out the looks, so pretty.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.417
{\an8}Oh, I wish I were them in Korea.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.669
{\an8}If their wish comes true,

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:10.296
{\an8}- I'm going to go over there.
- Me too.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.508
{\an8}He didn't pick up. Been there, done that.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.635
- Oh my God…
- I'm already nervous.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:16.928
- Check out the look.
- Wanna stop?

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:17.971
Oops.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.349
Each situation is worse than the next,
they're all awful.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.143
All K-dramas start like this, okay?

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.686
They all start badly, then…

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.106
They start well,
then get worse, then get better?

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.023
Yeah.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.694
Imagine crossing the world,
then calling and not being answered.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.654
{\an8}I don't want
to look like a fool, but damn.

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:37.824
{\an8}I came from the other side
of the planet, and then he disappeared.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.200
She doesn't know if he's real.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.120
I think my biggest fear would be
the person not being real.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.038
- Dear Lord.
- Like, being catfished.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.832
- He ghosted her.
- He hasn't answered her.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.834
I already don't like Mari's man.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.752
Man, they talked for a month and a half,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.921
then the guy messaged her a bunch,

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.217
and she thought they would meet and
he'd be the ideal man. Come on. And she--

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.802
She was ready to get married.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.304
{\an8}- Sit.
- Million-dollar question.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.973
{\an8}Will we experience a K-drama,
do you think?

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.933
She's gonna get screwed.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.728
{\an8}I borrowed money
from my friends so I could travel.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:07.854
My God…

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.732
How long have we known each other?
I can ask you for money, right?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:11.733
Apparently not.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.527
They don't have Venmo.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.196
What is she doing there?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.156
She nearly ruined her credit
to go meet him.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.199
For this Korean guy?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.826
These girls are in too deep
with these men.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.621
- Don't have to be psychic to know that.
- So naive. You don't have to be psychic.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:26.998
Luanny!

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.586
He looks like a walking therapy bill.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.421
At least he exists.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.384
What's that? Is he proposing?

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.428
Is that a ring box?

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.638
Is he proposing?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.223
Oh my God!

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.350
In Brazil, this would be crazy.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.894
Proposing that quickly?
Only my brother and Virgínia.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.479
I've never seen this before.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.272
- Let's see what happens.
- Let's see.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.066
Already?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.192
No way! How come?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.781
Oh my God, are those hearing aids?

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:02.033
It's a flash drive?
Oh, they're headphones.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:02.951
Headphones?

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.078
He may be weird but he's cute.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.038
Headphones?

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.749
Ahh!

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.334
Is he planting a bug on her?

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.753
- Look at me, all traumatized.
- Oh, come on.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.215
- That's so cute, translation technology--
- That's what's missing in Brazil.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.883
- Initiative.
- We're missing so many things.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.804
- Oh, come on…
- Hey, worst prank ever, man.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.098
But they say
Korean men are really charming,

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.016
- they treat women like queens.
- Yeah?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.814
- He's already touching her, look!
- Already touching her.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.107
This guy is forward.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.526
Whoa, what the heck?

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.445
He's petting her? He's doing it like this.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.281
I love a man like that, who takes charge.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.158
Yeah. See, when you least expect it,
love shows up.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.160
I'm not expecting anything, okay?

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.204
Do you have one for me?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.622
Well, at least he's honest.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.832
He's shameless.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.084
- Whoa!
- No way!

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.128
{\an8}No way! It's Jack. Jack is here!

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.797
Oh, "Jack."

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.676
{\an8}- Run, girl!
- She's going on a date!

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.761
You can't see anything,
not even at the door.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.976
Man, he's handsome.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.603
- Oh, he's so cute.
- I like him.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.022
- He's hot.
- Handsome, very handsome.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.858
His hair is parted,
just the way she wanted.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.318
Oh, very princely.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.194
- Very princely.
- Oh, he's gorgeous.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.280
Look at those eyebrows, perfectly styled.

00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.781
Look how tall he is!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.075
- She's trying to steal her friend's man!
- Damn, he's hot.

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:28.453
She has good taste in men, huh?

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.122
He's got a sweet face. But is he really?

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.125
- His clothes… he's well-dressed.
- Look, how cute.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.085
He's wearing a suit.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.546
- The other girls want him now. Vultures.
- They're all excited.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.673
- Gossips!
- So good.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.967
And the other girls are all jealous…
Look, look.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:43.968
Yeah.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.179
How tall is he? Like, 5'9"?

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.139
He looks six feet to me.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.390
And 175.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.808
- What?
- And he's a Sagittarius.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.018
They need chemistry, though.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.563
Do you think they like Brazilian food?

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:57.774
- Some nice beans, cracklings…
- Yes, honey. Who wouldn't?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.986
You think they can resist a nice feijoada?
You're so funny.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.822
- I'd cook for the boys right away.
- That's how you…

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.866
'Cause then they'd get attached
to Brazilian food.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.869
Honey, right away. They can't find
our seasoning anywhere else.

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.662
Bitch, I can't cook, what do I do?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.664
- Really, bestie? I'll teach you.
- It's a low blow.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.416
I'm not going to say what I'd do instead.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.003
- It's like he's got a character limit.
- He…

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.758
{\an8}- What else?
- We talked a lot.

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.801
{\an8}We do.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.260
{\an8}Yeah, he's not going to…

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.847
This isn't going anywhere,
the guy is a systematic army man.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.017
- What?
- Cat, cat. I have cat allergy.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.894
{\an8}- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.938
- I'm a cat person.
- Oh, I like dogs better.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.189
Yikes, this is bad.

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:40.358
Imagine if your boyfriend
didn't like animals.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:41.943
- You have a huge farm.
- It'd be a mess.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:45.279
I wouldn't trade my animals for some guy.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.073
- You'd have to be crazy.
- I think--

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.158
You have so many.
Goats, chickens, everything.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.077
Maybe he'd get used to it
little by little.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.329
Wouldn't you get rid of some of them?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.290
No, there's plenty of men out there.
My animals are mine.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.960
God forbid. My little animals.
I only have one of each.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:00.211
{\an8}I'm a party girl.

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.964
{\an8}- Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Yeah.
- I like going out and drinking.

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.173
{\an8}I would be her friend.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.175
{\an8}A person who…

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.093
{\an8}See?

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.928
{\an8}- There's the conflict!
- He doesn't like going out.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.638
- Oh man.
- Oh no.

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.890
They have nothing in common, my God.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.976
She's slowly withering, the poor thing.

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:18.020
I really, you know, recently care
about health more.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.481
But then, the guys
that are so straight-laced

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.442
are the ones you want the most, you know?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.652
- Speak for yourself.
- To lead him astray.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.196
- Oh, to corrupt him.
- You know? Yeah.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.783
{\an8}Your family doesn't know
that I have a daughter.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.618
Ee… Tension.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.203
Oh, honey!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.788
{\an8}You're 35 years old.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.583
- Oh, damn!
- Thirty-five years old?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.043
Thirty-five? With that skin?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.087
Oh, I want to go to Korea.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.341
Oh, an old man. Just kidding.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.302
Well, he's experienced, right?

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.720
I don't trust that smile.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.181
{\an8}If we stay together,

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.766
{\an8}I'm not going to…

00:07:58.102 --> 00:07:59.854
hide anything from you.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:01.814
Girl, that man is a liar.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.650
Yeah, he looks like a scoundrel.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.779
{\an8}He makes a lot of bad investments,
and that makes things really hard for us.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.865
Oh, so he's a big spender, is that it?

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:13.326
- Do you trust him?
- No. No.

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.163
I mean, what's he spending money on?
Headphones?

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.500
- The headphones are going to win her over.
- But since it started translating,

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.335
she's only gotten more stressed out.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.963
Do you see any positives?

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.007
- I haven't seen any.
- Neither have I.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.176
{\an8}There's a saying
that I think suits you guys.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.844
{\an8}It says, "I'm not perfect,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.848
{\an8}but flowers may grow even
between the cracks in the stones."

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.600
- Wow.
- She came like…

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:41.062
- She really… She turned it around.
- Wow!

00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:43.898
When I don't know what to say,
I just start dropping quotes, you know?

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.566
- Like…
- My God!

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.902
"Even stone wears away
under constant dripping."

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:55.368
{\an8}You have to wear properly to meet my mom.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.745
{\an8}Yeah, I know.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.289
- What? Oh, come on!
- Seriously?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.249
- My God!
- Wow, man!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.167
Did I hear that correctly?

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.752
- Wow…
- No.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.295
I'm already annoyed. No.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.714
No Korean man
is going to tell me how to dress.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.924
Now I'm pissed off.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:12.635
- Oh, I don't like that boy.
- That man got on my nerves.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:14.804
I can't believe
they're all going to annoy me.

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.597
No!

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.349
That's a guy who wants to marry his mom.

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:20.476
Do I even want to meet your mom?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.936
Stay with your mom, then.

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:24.397
{\an8}Please grant me patience.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.690
- Look at him.
- Look.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.025
- She touched him.
- I think he's cute.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.320
He's in love. A kiss?

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.866
He's very different.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.826
On their first--

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.744
He just said, "Let's"?

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.706
- Oh, wow.
- She got a taste of Korea!

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:43.165
- Did they kiss?
- They did!

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.586
{\an8}That's crazy,
the internet is no-mans land.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.464
What now?

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.301
- She's gorgeous, isn't she?
- Wow, the hair.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.261
- Are those extensions?
- Definitely.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.430
Is she being exalted now?

00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:58.723
He does have his flaws.

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:02.560
He said he was going to pick her up at
the airport when she arrived from Brazil,

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.103
- but he didn't--
- That's awful.

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.229
I think that's awful.

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.731
I'm anxious.

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:08.107
Oh my God.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.109
- Turn around in slow motion.
- Wow.

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:12.069
- Mari.
- He showed up!

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.447
And we were judging him!

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.700
She had to go down all those steps?
Oh, how tiresome.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:20.578
Mari.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.041
{\an8}How can she turn around with
such a big smile after he stood her up?

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.375
- But he's handsome.
- Gorgeous.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.377
- I'd be furious.
- No, he could have his reasons.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.296
- They're all idiots!
- Look, no.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.174
Something could have happened.
An accident, you know, on the day.

00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:34.300
His phone could have died.

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.136
Unless he lost both hands in the accident,
he could have answered.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:38.220
He was mugged.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.057
{\an8}I came here to surprise… Whoa, whoa!

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.102
{\an8}- Oh, she's head over heels.
- Yeah, Mari is totally in love.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:49.106
{\an8}He left me waiting at the airport
and thinks a flower will fix it?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.067
{\an8}It's from my heart, that's why.

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:52.860
{\an8}Here.

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.195
It actually does.

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.822
- A single rose?
- No, then he shows up, gives her a rose…

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.407
Guys! Guys!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.452
He probably looked better on Instagram

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:02.703
- than in person.
- You think so?

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.997
- Know when you start acting really silly?
- Yeah.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:09.794
Like, he says something,
and she's like, "Oh, stop! Stop it!"

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:13.798
{\an8}I was waiting here by myself
and I really thought no one was coming.

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:17.927
{\an8}No, of course I was going to come.
Because you came to Korea to see…

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.096
{\an8}me, I hope, right?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.766
- They take so long to kiss, right?
- They do, I would've kissed him already.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.727
- If he were Brazilian…
- She was dying to kiss him, you know?

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.771
- Can't she?
- But let's take it slow.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.981
- Man, take it easy?
- Things are different here in Korea.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.525
- It's different there.
- Okay, fine.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:34.652
{\an8}- I'm worried of touching you.
- No, no.

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.823
Come on, give him a little kiss.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.617
- What a stiff hug.
- Honey, he left her hanging.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.035
That's how I hug my uncles.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.371
She's respecting his time too, you know?

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.831
- If she… yeah.
- If we were to act

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.041
- like we do here in Brazil…
- They run away, right?

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.251
- they get scared.
- They would.

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:52.420
Even I get a little scared sometimes.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.507
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.136
This girl needs to see a therapist.
She's not ready for a boyfriend.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.178
Oh my God.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.930
{\an8}He treats me like a princess.

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:06.559
{\an8}He doesn't curse at me,
he doesn't humiliate me, you know?

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.270
"How's your girlfriend?"
"Good, she didn't insult me today."

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:10.688
"She didn't insult me."

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.192
- Poor thing. She's used to toxic people.
- Oh my God!

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.069
{\an8}Can you help me translate this?

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:20.030
{\an8}Is everything okay?

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.951
- Oh my God.
- Wow.

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:27.204
{\an8}"Luanny, the day we meet again,

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:31.208
{\an8}I want to confess something
you didn't know."

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:32.418
- What?
- He was engaged?

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.170
- He lived with someone?
- I thought so too.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.171
Ah…

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.297
My God, what could it be?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.050
I think he's gonna tell her
that he's actually 15, not 35.

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.093
With that skin, no doubt!

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:44.054
He's going to propose to me.

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.182
Oh, she's so naive, the poor thing.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.559
Eat very carefully,
maybe the ring is in there.

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.312
Guys, that's not how it works.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:54.315
She thinks the ring is in the lettuce!

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:55.274
{\an8}No, it's not…

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.067
{\an8}- No way, guys.
- No, man.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.153
{\an8}Oh my God, now what?

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.490
{\an8}A letter?

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.910
It's a gift card from
a store he likes, you know?

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.411
I'm expecting too much.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.288
Ahh! Come on!

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.126
Look how beautiful it is
behind them, Nicole!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.253
Is the proposal coming?

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.301
Oh, wow!

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.512
Oh, that's wonderful!

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:25.846
The best couple.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.556
Nice. Nice.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.642
- That's great!
- She's gonna hurt her knee!

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.352
Oh, that's goals.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.814
- Aw, that was cute, man.
- I thought it was cute, really sweet.

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:39.235
She threw herself at him,
she's got snot in her nose and everything!

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.655
- The trip is already worth it.
- It was so worth it.

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.907
She came back
with a husband as a souvenir.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.034
Her friend is going to lose it
back at the house.

00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:48.744
She will, she'll be very envious for sure.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.288
Definitely, and soon
they'll be in a fight.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:52.998
I need to confess.

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.875
- He's going to confess.
- Yeah.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.710
- Oh dear…
- My God.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.170
What do you guys think it is?

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.172
- I don't even wanna look.
- My God in heaven!

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.340
{\an8}You didn't cheat, right?

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.219
"You didn't cheat, did you?
Oh, you were arrested?"

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.471
She's Brazilian, she's straight-forward.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.473
- He's so shameless.
- If he lies to his mother,

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.101
- think he wouldn't lie to that blonde?
- Said he paid for the trip.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:15.813
{\an8}I already have a daughter,
I can't take care of a grown man too.

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.398
Exactly.

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.899
- Look at the difference.
- Oh man…

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.442
- Yeah.
- The inequality.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.362
- A proposal at a fancy restaurant…
- No comparison, right, Gabi?

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.864
They're not even in a nice place,

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.448
he's telling her about his trauma

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.908
- on the street.
- On foot!

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.160
- Just-just end it, just end it all, right?
- On foot!

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.996
Manchild.

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.415
- I'm gonna grab some candy.
- Go ahead.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:36.625
Grab some for us.

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:39.587
I've never had Korean candy.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.714
Me neither. Damn it, it won't open.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.513
Oh my God, man.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.600
What is this thing?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.192
It gets sweeter later.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.110
When?

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.653
Just give it a few sucks.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.655
It will get sweet, you'll see.

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:10.993
Katy's screwed.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:20.002
What a great start.
He went and sat way the hell over there.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.004
- Perfect.
- No way, he sat away from her?

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.797
He sat on the other side… He sat next to--

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:25.883
- What the hell, man?
- What are you doing?

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:28.510
- Oy.
- I told you, it's because of the cats.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.721
But hitting on her
in front of the dude is dirty.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.847
Look, he's just staring.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.767
I think their ring is very ugly.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.310
So, Danny…

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.771
Wow, what a jerk!

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.732
Honey, you can't even buy candy!

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:44.526
- Criticizing the ring, so trashy!
- Criticizing someone else's ring!

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.945
Oh, he's so jealous!

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.530
- The fights are already starting.
- Did you feel the vibe shift?

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.908
When he got there,
I feel like the vibe just died,

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:52.284
the whole place.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.535
Doesn't know when to shut up,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.788
- doesn't know when to talk.
- Wow, she does not give in.

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.247
I think…

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.126
they are… Brazilian girls…

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.424
have very strange…

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.009
- Strange?
- …personalities.

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.180
Man, who is this guy?

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.851
- For God's sake.
- Never met a guy like that.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.061
- Jesus Christ.
- He's impossible.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.646
Yeah, he's something else.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:21.647
Goddamn.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.816
Girl, that guy is so annoying.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.528
She said it! Camila said
what we're all thinking.

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:30.155
- So fucking annoying, that's right.
- She said it.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.658
- I want to go there and shake her.
- Me too.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.743
Can't she just, like, find another guy?

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.161
Poor thing.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.249
{\an8}It's a temple, right?

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.459
- Look, how beautiful!
- "Boochon Hakon"? Is that it?

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.838
Don't try, babe. Don't even try, Nicole.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.382
Just leave it, okay?

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.473
Oh my God! I'm speechless.

00:16:56.557 --> 00:17:00.144
- Oh, it's her man, that's amazing!
- I'm gagged!

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:02.438
This man is full of surprises.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.232
- Look, they have matching outfits!
- So sweet!

00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:07.568
- He's scoring a lot of points.
- He's so cool.

00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.069
I'm already in love with him.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:10.904
He proposed to her, yeah.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.740
Oh, how beautiful!

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:15.492
Yeah, they really,
like, they stand out, right?

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.494
- They're working.
- This couple is working. They are--

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.121
He acts with love.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.956
First episode and they're already engaged.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.916
And they don't have
financial problems, right?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.044
- Everything is fine.
- And he'll come to Brazil.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.295
If you're about to cry--

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.963
Girl, just grab a tissue.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:28.922
Grab a tissue.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.216
Thanks. I think you grabbed it wrong…

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.596
You're supposed to pull it here.

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:36.638
Oh dear.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:37.931
Good thing I didn't cry.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.103
She's going to fall in love,

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.438
- and he'll be jumping.
- She will.

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.898
Look at his size.

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:48.734
- He's so fit, what a stud!
- Look at his arms!

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:50.152
Oh wow!

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:53.655
- Girl, he's a Korean dreamboat.
- I want one like that!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:58.327
- Wow, look at him working out, whoa!
- Nicole! Take me there, look at his legs!

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.079
It's a different kind of date, right?

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.580
- Taking her to work out.
- Look, let him…

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:04.541
Oh, that's clever.
They're gonna work out and…

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.585
If they don't have anything to talk about…
Break the ice.

00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:09.046
- …they can just jump rope.
- Yeah, they'll have an activity.

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:14.843
{\an8}Are you like a morning person,
more than… more than night?

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.138
{\an8}No, I'm a night person.
I like going out at night, drinking.

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.475
This girl must be going crazy,
she can't get a kiss!

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:23.519
- Yeah, yeah, oh! Wow.
- She must be delirious.

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.063
- I'm in agony here!
- She must be feverish by now.

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:27.689
- Just the two of them…
- She doesn't touch him,

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.150
she doesn't do anything,
and he's all ripped.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:32.277
He has the charisma of a doorknob, right?

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.321
- Totally.
- He doesn't laugh at anything.

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.697
They're polar opposites.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.367
I think it's more of a friendship
than a relationship, huh?

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.203
So far, they have
absolutely nothing in common.

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.788
Yes, they do. They both breathe.

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:49.128
It's not like there's a huge problem
or something, like, "Wow!"

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.838
But they're just too different, you know?

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.340
- They don't have a connection.
- Too different.

00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:55.634
I wouldn't even be his friend. So meh.

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.052
He has nothing to talk about.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.762
So bland,
he doesn't even know how to talk.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:01.056
- He doesn't talk.
- I'd rather talk to a wall.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.685
{\an8}I want to be your friend,
like, keep as friends.

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.812
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, me too.
- Okay? Yes.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.647
They didn't work out.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.733
Yeah, but at least
it was sort of clear, right?

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.486
- It was an end, like, she was clear.
- They have nothing in common.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.906
- Also, he didn't make anything up.
- She's a night person, he's a day person.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.534
Yeah, and he didn't make up any excuses.

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:23.120
I think they're just not very compatible.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.746
- Not at all.
- He was okay with it,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.541
- that they're better off as friends.
- They're too different.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.755
{\an8}- Welcome to…
- Wow, it's so nice.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.049
{\an8}- …this bar.
- Oh!

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.136
{\an8}Now I have a K-drama to call my own.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:40.679
She's living it, isn't she?

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:43.265
- She's living in her own show.
- Her own K-drama. She's living it.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:46.810
{\an8}- Is it allowed to hold…
- It's allowed to hold hands.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:47.936
- Ahh!
- Your hand.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.021
What's this?

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:53.317
I'm shaking. I'm getting anxious.
I'm sweating, look.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.568
Damn!

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:57.487
- Girl, Koreans are so respectful!
- So cute!

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.656
Wow, if we took this guy to a funk party,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.700
- he would die.
- Wow!

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:02.993
But she's looking so smitten.

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:05.871
Like, "Dude, just kiss me already!
Take some action!"

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.040
But he's also kind of smitten.

00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:10.375
The pace really is different there,
isn't it?

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.128
Look at that, how cute,
he asked if he could hold her hand,

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.007
and here people are like,
"Oh, do you spit or swallow?" You know?

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.258
Oh my God, dude!

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:19.885
- They're so polite.
- They are.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.637
- One of the things I admire…
- That's great.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.263
…the most about them, about their culture.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.598
- Quite charming.
- I think so too.

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:27.392
Here, we rush things… and then,
there's nothing left to happen.

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.394
- No… yeah.
- Here, it's a process.

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:32.648
- They prolong the process of passion.
- Yeah, you take it slow,

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.441
you talk… It becomes more intense

00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:36.276
- and long-lasting.
- Let me ask you a question.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.321
Today they held hands.
To kiss, it'll take two months.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.572
What if the kiss is bad?

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.617
Then you find a way, you do other things.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.952
Do you think they'll kiss now?

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:48.622
- Could it happen?
- No, no. It's only the second date.

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:51.541
{\an8}We will hug each other
and we're gonna, like…

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:52.501
- Mwah.
- Oh my--

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.794
…kiss the cheek.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.004
- What?
- Called it!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.632
- She's already jumping on him.
- I don't think he liked it.

00:20:58.715 --> 00:20:59.633
He pulled away.

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.468
- Wow, girl!
- Never got to do that.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:04.137
- On the cheek, on the mouth--
- Hey, watch it. Easy there.

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.181
Take it easy.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.975
He was shocked
when she kissed him on the cheek.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:09.476
He was super shocked.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:12.354
- Imagine when they go to bed.
- Imagine he came to Brazil as a tourist.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:13.605
Like, "Hey, how are you?"

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.983
He'll get kissed on the cheek,
like, 15 times…

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.359
- 15 little kisses.
- He'll go crazy.

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.319
- They'll put their hand around his waist.
- Right.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.738
- In Korea, it's not very common to, like--
- Kissing?

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:22.948
No, not just kissing.

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.574
- Out of the blue…
- Hugging too.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.785
…kissing on the cheek
on the second date, you know?

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:27.995
So, it kind of startles them.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.830
He's so embarrassed!

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:33.625
You're not going to be like, "Ooh."
You're going to be like…

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.294
Yeah, that's normal in Brazil.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:36.586
Let's do it again, I guess.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.839
Mr. Korean liked it!

00:21:38.922 --> 00:21:41.049
- He's a fast learner!
- He likes it!

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.303
- Mr. Korean likes it!
- Dirty boy!

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:45.429
Look, he likes it.

00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:49.141
- He's a cutie. "Oh, stop it!"
- He's like, "Stop with these sexy games!"

00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:53.061
{\an8}- Ppoppo!
- Not cool, not cool!

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.896
{\an8}She's asking for it.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.232
He's loosening up a little bit.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:01.361
{\an8}How is he going to react
to a big kiss on the lips? I'm ready.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:02.821
That came out wrong.

00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:03.739
Saying…

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.949
Imagine a butt on his mouth!

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.078
I thought he was using slang
for "booty", like "butt."

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.497
- Let's take it easy, Nicole.
- Ppoppo.

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.999
This is not that kind of show.

00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:15.834
{\an8}Is there something specific…

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:18.587
{\an8}She already wants to move on
to the next phase!

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.548
{\an8}What would it be?
Is she wearing her lingerie?

00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:22.924
Imagine wearing new panties

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.509
- and never getting to use them.
- Never!

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.762
{\an8}- We're back to-to Luanny.
- Luanny.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.221
Poor thing.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.641
She's making a list of the pros and cons.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.185
{\an8}He's romantic.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:35.812
{\an8}- Is he? Is he, though?
- Romantic?

00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:39.649
Oh, guys, she's delusional.
Aw, I feel sorry for her.

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:43.320
{\an8}- Grab your purse and go with your friends!
- You're gonna drink soju and sing karaoke.

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:46.114
{\an8}Girl, for God's sake, stop being crazy.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.075
She went and fell in love
with the wrong person.

00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:49.618
Girl, honestly…

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.120
- I've been there.
- Yeah, who hasn't, am I right?

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.081
But when I feel like it's over, I end it,

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:55.624
- I don't keep dragging it out.
- Yeah.

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:58.502
- I wanna hear what his excuse is today.
- She has to be straight with him.

00:22:58.585 --> 00:22:59.961
Don't keep dragging it out.

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.214
- He should be wearing…
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:03.173
He didn't even say hi.

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:04.925
He just went in, didn't even kiss her…

00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.676
- He didn't even look her in the eye.
- Just…

00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.095
- Arms like this.
- Look.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:10.639
- Oh, he's mad.
- He didn't even say hi to her.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.725
- Oh, you mad, baby?
- Seriously, guys…

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.644
Now is the time
for her to break up with him.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:20.232
These girls are around 27, 28 years old?

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:23.318
In astrology, there's something
called the Saturn return.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:26.405
When you're around that age,
you're suddenly dying to get married.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:28.156
And when does Saturn leave?

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.992
- At 27 or eight, Saturn leaves--
- And what about the return?

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:33.745
No, it starts and returns
between those ages.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.789
- Oh, then I guess I'm 28.
- You are?

00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:36.748
Yeah.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.333
Why, are you…

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:42.045
Dying to get married.
I must be about 28 years old.

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.881
Your Saturn must be really… Either that,

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:47.634
- or your Venus is well-aspected.
- Could be.

00:23:47.717 --> 00:23:50.929
I gotta be very honest with you.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.556
What is it today?

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.975
Could it be just that he needs money?

00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:56.226
I think it's more than that.

00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:57.853
How come you're upset?

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.646
- Trying how?
- What did he even do?

00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:01.731
But you stress me out every day.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:05.986
- Wow, she's going to feel so guilty, man.
- Oh, he plays games, like…

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.155
Emotional blackmail.

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.614
I stressed you out?

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.575
You cheated on me, you know that?

00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:13.577
- We didn't know that!
- Cheated?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.121
Bombshell! The Turkish girl, remember?

00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:17.914
Oh, my goodness.

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:19.040
Bombshell!

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.876
Turkish girl?

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:23.920
- What a scoundrel he is!
- Stop being crazy, girl! Just end it!

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:25.881
- No, this guy is bad news.
- Totally.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.799
Someone has to tell her. They have to.

00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:28.884
Please, for God's sake!

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.219
Oh, then it's all wrong, man.

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:33.388
- Oh, it's over.
- Poor girl! What is she doing in Korea?

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.890
Manchild!

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:35.891
Immature.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:38.602
- My God, what a scandal!
- That's crazy!

00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:40.937
- She never told us that!
- Oh my God, yeah!

00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:43.899
Man, he cheated on her!
With the Turkish girl!

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.109
But how'd he get the money
to get this Turkish girl too?

00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:47.694
- Yeah, if he doesn't have money?
- Yeah!

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:51.323
- I am shook--
- Man, that Korean guy is naughty.

00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:53.617
Oh my God! I'll go get her
on my bike, for God's sake.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.911
Bro, I can forgive cheating,
but don't get back together.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.287
If you cheat, you're on your own.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.873
Can you imagine leaving Brazil…
I'm speechless.

00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.750
- …to go suffer in Korea?
- Wow!

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.793
- No.
- To get cheated on in Korea?

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.921
- Wow.
- How do you say "cheating" in Korean?

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.173
- I don't even know, I'm shook.
- Wow, my friend.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:13.053
- So he cheated on her?
- I cannot believe he wants to dump her.

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:14.095
It's over? Ahh!

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.348
- Oh my God.
- How come?

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.141
- Hang on, my love.
- Girl…

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:21.228
- Oh no, I'm curious. Where's the next one?
- Netflix, I want to know more.

00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:24.439
Where's that Turkish girl?
I want to have a word with her too!
