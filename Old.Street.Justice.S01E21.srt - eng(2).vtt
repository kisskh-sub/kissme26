WEBVTT

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.640
Jin Jungang

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.119
This should be enough, right?

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.399
Put the gun down.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.560
Release Young Master Tang now.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.159
Gangzi

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.079
You're not like them.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.319
Don't get blood on your hands.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:11.519
Go.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.239
I wanted to kill that jerk Wuya.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.680
If you had killed him,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.079
Brother and everyone else couldn't have left.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.519
Start the engine.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.400
Drive.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.200
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.599
I'll kill you!

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.319
How is Gangzi?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560
The doctor said he's not in mortal danger.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.159
It's just that...

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.800
He might need crutches for a few years.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.319
That jerk Tang Huiyao.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.639
Shengzi, what are you looking for?

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.840
Uncle, Auntie.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.360
Isn't this you as a kid?

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.680
This is...

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.560
A key.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.840
Second Master.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.039
It seems Zhao Fengsheng's actions at the casino

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.120
were really to find something.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.319
What's the use of saying this now?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.840
Go and quickly

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.919
check the ledgers and other important documents again.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.159
See what's missing.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.159
Yes.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.800
Huiyao.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.159
Does it still hurt?

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.319
Does it hurt or not?

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.520
It doesn't hurt anymore, Dad.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.759
Dad.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.680
Zhao Fengsheng took the bracelet.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.919
Could he already have...

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.159
discovered the secret of the gold mine?

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.840
So what if he has?

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:03.560
Huiyao.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.759
When facing trouble, don't hesitate.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.439
You just need to keep looking forward.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.919
That's how your old man

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.360
climbed up, step by step.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.639
Dad.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.000
What should we do now?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.519
Our Tang family is the strongest force in Bian Shui.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.680
We must crush Old Street and Zhao Fengsheng directly.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.319
Crush him.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.399
How?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.839
How do we do it?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.279
Smother them with money.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.680
I'll give you thirty million.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.439
Feed it to those people on Old Street.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.959
We must get Old Street before Zhao Fengsheng tells them

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.439
the secret of the gold mine.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.800
Really give that much money to those Old Street trash?

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.720
Give it to them.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.480
Will they even know how to spend it?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.079
Take out the counterfeit money we've made over the years.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.519
Once Old Street is demolished,

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.120
what can they do even if they find out?

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.839
Good.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.319
I'll get people on it right away.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:04.639
So...

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.279
this is what Dad meant in his letter.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.560
Shengzi.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.839
Why is Tang Hongtu so fixated on Old Street?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.279
It's time to reveal Old Street's secret.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.800
Weren't you going to tell us the secret?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.720
Why bring us to the backyard?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.560
Tang Hongtu has always wanted to get Old Street.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.439
If I'm not mistaken,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.560
the secret is right here.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.920
A gold mine worth a fortune.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.319
Gold?

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:49.839
We grew up on Old Street.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.279
The older generation dug coal and iron mines for years.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.079
We never heard of any gold mine.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.680
This is the secret my dad always kept.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.439
And the reason something happened to him.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.800
What exactly happened?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.759
Brother.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.839
This isn't just mud inside.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:12.759
This is the spot.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.319
There really is a hole.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.959
This looks like an old mine.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.120
My dad's letter said

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.600
this was opened by my great-grandfather

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.160
over a hundred years ago.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.079
Back then, due to rebel army interference,

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:44.160
there was no time to mine it.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.040
Later,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.240
more and more people came to Old Street,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.079
and this mine shaft was never opened again.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.800
So that's how it is.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.079
It really is gold dust.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:07.839
So beautiful.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.360
It's so shiny.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.079
This is what my dad

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.560
risked his life to leave for me.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.600
Brother.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.120
I don't understand.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.360
Five years ago, when I fought with Wuya,

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.399
my dad tried to come protect me.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.639
But he was assassinated on the way.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.160
That's true.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.639
Wuya's men were all on Old Street at that time.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.279
And after my dad died,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.879
Tang Hongtu suddenly appeared in Bian Shui.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.559
In just a few years,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.720
he became a billionaire.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.279
You're saying...

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.639
Uncle Zhao's death is related to Tang Hongtu?

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.720
Tang Hongtu wants to demolish Old Street

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.879
for this gold mine.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.159
Brother.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.840
Then what should we do?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.600
First, protect Old Street.

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:03.320
Then crush the Tang Group hard.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.879
Make Tang Hongtu kowtow and apologize at my dad's grave.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.159
Good.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.440
We also need to avenge Dagang.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.600
Deal with that Tang Huiyao.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:13.720
There's another thing.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.320
Chen Xiaobei and Uncle Snake used a fake contract

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.639
to trick the neighbors in the north.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.840
They only paid a down payment

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.360
and demolished half of Old Street.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.000
Luckily, this mine shaft is in the south.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:27.159
Should we tell Old Buddha and the others

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.360
about this gold mine?

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.679
It's not that I don't trust Old Buddha.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:32.840
It's just that with many people, words spread.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.879
Once news of the gold mine gets out,

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.799
I'm afraid the neighbors will panic.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.159
Brother is right.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.759
If this gold mine is exposed,

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.879
forces outside Bian Shui will get involved.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.559
So we need to cooperate with the Qian Group

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.120
and then crush the Tang Group hard.
