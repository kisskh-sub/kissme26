WEBVTT

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:45.759
Come in.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.840
Come in.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.600
Come.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.920
This is from before.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.000
Your commission for persuading the north side neighbors to sign.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Bei Wazi.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.799
This money doesn't feel too hot to hold, does it?

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.079
The demolition is already done.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.280
Now you don't dare take it?

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:07.959
Don't feel burdened.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.840
It's Second Master Tang who wants the street demolished.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.200
Who could stop him?

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.480
Persuade ten households, get twenty thousand.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.840
Earn another hundred thousand.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.120
Then you can move to the city to live with your son.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400
What does this Old Street have to do with you anymore?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.439
Alright.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.760
This demolition commission...

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.959
...earns way more than snatching kids.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.480
Hey, Uncle Snake.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.480
I still need to tell you.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.640
The few dozen households left on the south side...

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.239
...will all be yours from now on.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.480
We'll split the money we make.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.000
Right?

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:00.879
Alright.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.359
Tianyu.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Take a look at this.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.519
Chairman.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.159
Miss.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.719
Mr. Zhao is here.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:09.960
You're busy.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.319
Miss Qian is here too.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.000
Brother Fengsheng, please sit.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.479
So late at night...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.719
...you must have business.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.639
It's still about the Old Street demolition, right?

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.039
Still about this matter?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800
Tang Hongtu has already come to warn us.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.240
The Tang family now...

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.360
...doesn't even regard Young Master Li highly.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.360
We truly are powerless to help.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.639
Aren't you already working for Tang Hongtu?

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.599
Why come back to test our Qian family?

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:38.719
It's a misunderstanding.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.719
I went to work at the Tang Group...

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.400
...to investigate some things.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.360
A spy.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.360
Understand?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.000
Then...

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.879
...what do you hope we do, Brother Fengsheng?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.199
I want you to put up forty million.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.879
To buy up all the land on Old Street.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.560
Forty million?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.280
You've even figured out...

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.319
...how much cash flow our Qian family has?

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.879
Are you trying to wipe us out in one go?

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.080
We're grasshoppers tied to the same rope.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.960
If you can put up forty million...

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.439
...I'm confident I can help you swallow up the Tang family.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.599
Your habit of boasting hasn't changed a bit.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.039
Please come back next time after preparing your script.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.400
Even Young Master Li wouldn't dare guarantee this.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.199
Is this even possible?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.120
Our Qian family is a snake...

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.400
...but we can't swallow the Tang family elephant.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.479
Mr. Zhao.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.639
Please leave.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.560
There's a gold mine under Old Street.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.400
Tang Hongtu wants it all for himself.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.479
A gold mine?

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.840
Brother Fengsheng.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.039
Are your words true?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.919
Chairman Qian.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.879
Do you think I would joke...

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.039
...about something this big?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.439
This is my mother's keepsake.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.560
It was made from the gold under Old Street.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.039
No wonder Tang Hongtu wants Old Street all to himself.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.479
So there's such a huge secret hidden here.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.719
We were already...

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.960
...being crushed by the Tang Group's power.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.120
If Tang Hongtu gets the gold mine too...

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.600
...the Qian family won't be able to stay in Bianshui anymore.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.959
It's precisely because it concerns the Qian Group's survival...

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.600
...that I hope you'll act.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.480
Good.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.079
I'll have someone mobilize funds right now.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.720
Dad.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.920
You can't be so hasty...

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.079
...just because of his few words.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.480
Even if Old Street really has a gold mine...

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.560
...what's the gold content?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.519
Is it easy to mine?

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.040
How much capital do we need to invest?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.680
And how do we negotiate development...

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.360
...with the original Old Street residents?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.079
These are all issues that need consideration.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.480
It's so complicated.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.839
Of course.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:45.959
This concerns...

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.759
...our Qian Group's future.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.079
You think this is child's play?

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:50.480
We must first find experts...

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.759
...to survey the mine's location and content.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.199
Assess the mining difficulty.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.160
Only after predicting the return on profit...

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.399
...can we make a move.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.399
No.

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.079
I'm only giving you one night to consider.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.319
If you won't do it...

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.920
...I'll find someone else.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.279
Tianyu.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.399
This is our last chance.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.680
I'll go prepare the funds immediately.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.959
Dad!

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.360
Young Master Tang.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.319
Why have you come in person?

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.680
Useless.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.319
If you weren't so damn slow...

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.279
...would I need to handle this myself?

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.680
Young Master Tang.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.120
The north side is already demolished.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.560
Just give me a little more time.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.360
No need.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.920
I've already figured out a way to flatten Old Street.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.399
Go call everyone out.

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.360
Yes, yes, yes.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.600
Neighbors!

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.800
Everyone, come out!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800
They're all coming out.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.040
They're all coming out.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.439
They're all coming out.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.839
Our good days are here!

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.240
Neighbors!

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:26.920
Neighbors!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.759
They're all coming out.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.519
Idiot!

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.879
What good is this thing?

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.879
Uh, neighbors!

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:52.959
They're all coming out.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.399
Our good days are here!

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.480
Come on, come on, everyone out!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.199
Quick, quick, quick!

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.759
Come!

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.720
They're all coming out.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.519
Come over!

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.519
Everyone, come over!

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.399
You over there, come over, come over!

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.600
Neighbors in the back, hurry up!

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:10.879
Where's the laundry detergent?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.720
We don't have any.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.040
Just wash it like this then.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.240
Brother.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.560
The Tang family is here with excavators.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.279
Gangzi, your leg isn't healed yet.

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.399
What are you running around for?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800
I'm as strong as an ox.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.199
It's just one leg.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.040
It's no big deal.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.240
Besides,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.839
these bastards started making trouble early in the morning.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.480
I couldn't sleep anyway.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.519
Let's go.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.079
Let's go get revenge for Gangzi.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.839
What are you doing?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.240
It's so early in the morning.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.399
Tang family, why have you brought so many people

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.319
to cause trouble in our Old Street?

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:02.439
Our Tang Group

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.160
signed a development contract with you.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.639
Old Street must be demolished today.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.120
Bullshit!

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.720
We neighbors from the south haven't signed anything.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.319
If you want to force a demolition,

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:14.040
ask if we neighbors agree to it.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.000
Exactly!

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.720
If you want to tear down my house,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.279
I'll fight you to the death!

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:19.040
Fight you to the death!

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.279
What's all this noise?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.720
Everyone, stop arguing!

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:26.720
Those from the north who signed the contract,

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.079
all come stand over here.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.360
I have something important to say.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.720
Tang Huiyao,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.440
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:37.440
Our Tang Group

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.200
wants to demolish the entire Old Street.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.840
You people who signed the contract,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.000
you've already received a payment, right?

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.519
We did get it,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.759
but our houses have been torn down.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.200
This first payment won't last us long.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.240
That's right.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.159
Young Master Tang,

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.039
when can we get

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.559
the rest of our money?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.759
Good question.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:03.200
Take a good look at the contract in your hands.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.919
Doesn't it clearly state

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.399
that the final payment

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.480
is given when Old Street is fully demolished?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.320
What does that mean?

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.039
It means,

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.080
if the south isn't demolished,

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:19.480
you won't get a single cent.
