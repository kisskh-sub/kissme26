WEBVTT

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.842
-Anyone on your mind?
-I felt a spark.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.478
I want to be with someone
who gives me butterflies.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.080
When I think he's cute, that turns me on.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.083
ANYONE CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.255
Are you all in love?

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.757
Yes, I am.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.425
It made me want a boyfriend.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.962
-Do you tell your parents?
-Yeah, I can tell them anything.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.632
"You will go on a sleepover date,
just the two of you."

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.836
THEIR TIME TOGETHER IS LIMITED

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.308
If we wait, happiness will never come.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.177
Why not try to make him fall for me?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.348
I'm glad I could spend this time
with you guys.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.584
In our world…

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.556
A STORY OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.392
I've been without my parents
from the time I was born.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.762
I don't know what "family" is.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.966
Why was I born this way?

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.957
Thank you for inviting me.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.358
I'm Dai.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:16.296
I'm 22 and a university student.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:22.368
I've been through so much
that I believe I may never find love.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:27.807
I really hope to find romance
or a great partner.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.978
A vibe unique to that person.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.514
I'm attracted to people
who are a bit eccentric.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:39.352
What I worked up my courage to say
was totally ignored…

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.554
There is one hot guy.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.555
What?

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:17.824
Nice to meet you.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.892
Nice to meet you.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.395
My name is Taeheon.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:25.031
I turned 34 this year.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.166
I'm a designer.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.869
I'm from South Korea.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:35.141
I'm drawn to people
who aren't also in the field of design.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:40.747
It would be good if we could broaden
each other's perspectives.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:44.450
I haven't come out to my family yet.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.020
Well, all of my friends know.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:50.023
I felt this could be a great opportunity

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.494
to openly express who I am to my family.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:58.197
We can see the entrance a bit from here.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.199
Yes, I saw you coming.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.002
I thought,
"Oh, a good-looking guy is here."

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.952
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.121
Nice to meet you.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.289
Nice to meet you.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.557
Nice to meet you.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.192
Please take a seat anywhere.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.469
I'm Ryota. I am 28 years old.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:40.473
I'm a model, and a barista at a café.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:45.578
I don't think I need to decide
if I'm only attracted

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.114
to men or only women.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.751
No matter who I love, that's who I am.

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.787
I'd like to accept that part of me.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.592
If I'm attracted to someone
who already likes someone else,

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.762
I tend to step back and give up.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.733
I hope I can grow and become brave enough

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.035
to make a move.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.171
How tall are you?

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.373
182 centimeters.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.640
You're tall.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.111
I'm envious, really.

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.423
Someone is coming in.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.060
There he is.

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:34.961
Hello.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.496
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.433
-It's nice to see you.
-Nice to meet you.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.135
Where should I go?

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.171
My name is Gensei. I'm 34 years old.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.707
I'm a hair and makeup artist.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.244
Of course, the best thing is to meet
someone compatible,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.514
but it'd be nice to find romance.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.116
It's a bit abstract,

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:02.088
but someone who is good-looking
and a bit masculine,

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.824
but with a sensitive side.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.093
I tend to like that type.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.009
Someone is…

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.510
We have one more.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.147
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:29.849
Nice to meet you.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.784
I'm Shun Nakanishi. Nice to meet you.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:32.919
-Hello.
-You too.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:39.525
I'm Shun Nakanishi, 23 years old.

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:44.597
My job is to create music, and I also DJ.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:49.735
Ending up with the person I love
would make me happiest.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:53.272
I'm the type of person
who thinks about marriage,

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.341
so I'm looking for someone
I can see a future with.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.679
I'd like a relationship
in which we can grow together.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.249
I want to have a same-sex marriage.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.284
As for kids,

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.855
I'd like to adopt.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:14.060
He didn't really walk the walk.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:16.496
I thought, "Okay, I'm over it."

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.030
I want some space.

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.334
-I know.
-It pinged.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.503
-Will you check, please?
-Should I look?

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.841
It says, "This is a notice."

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:29.842
Okay.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.611
-A notice?
-What is it?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.480
"Welcome to the Green Room."

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.283
Oh, this house is called the Green Room.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.518
-That's cute.
-I know.

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.619
Because it's green.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:45.157
"You will begin living together here
for about a month."

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.058
Your turn.

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.026
Me?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.296
"'Green Room' is a surfing term."

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:56.802
"It refers to the sacred space
inside a barrel produced by a wave."

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:57.703
Here.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:08:59.672
I hope I can read it.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:04.810
"We hope this month will be
a brilliant time for all of you."

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:09.582
"We also hope you find
an irreplaceable partner."

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.019
-That's lovely.
-Please read this.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:18.190
"Now, we've prepared
a coffee truck for you."

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:19.292
-Coffee?
-What?

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.528
"By running it together as a team,

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.531
we hope you can deepen your bonds."

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:29.735
"You are free to use the proceeds
as you wish."

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:31.003
That's how it is.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:38.744
It started.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.613
-This is good!
-Wonderful.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.847
It's gripping already.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.082
I'm psyched.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.886
So now our new show,
The Boyfriend, has begun.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.924
The cast is made up of young men
who are attracted to other men.

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.961
The boys will live together
for about a month.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:59.765
It's a story of love and friendship.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:04.070
Wait. Don't say it like
an announcement at a department store.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.539
-I'm so psyched right now.
-Me too.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.609
-The cast is really attractive.
-It's exciting.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.143
The coffee truck…

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.514
They're going to run one together, right?

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.652
And they will be allowed to use
the proceeds as they wish.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.756
You see a different side of a person
when you work together.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.491
-I know!
-That's really true.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:29.328
This will let them be alone with someone,
discuss various matters,

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.230
and bring them closer.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.865
That's true.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.634
Maybe someone will steal the money.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.202
-What?
-No one will do that.

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.604
The episode title will be
"Today's Proceeds Are Gone."

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:42.074
We'd like to look forward
to such incidents though.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.677
Durian, we've heard you are
an experienced drag queen?

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:48.948
Yes, I am. Usually, my makeup is
six times as thick.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.216
-That much?
-Yes.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.484
Yes, like this.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.885
-Beautiful!
-So gorgeous.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.620
That's how I usually look.

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:55.588
Amazing!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.625
Since it's the first episode,
I came au naturel.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.895
-So you'll show up with different looks?
-Please look forward to it.

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.964
-I'm so excited!
-That makes me happy.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.600
The cast is well-balanced.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:13.205
Gay guys tend to be
attracted to others with similar looks.

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.374
-Really?
-But they're well-balanced.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:21.347
And it's not like they all hit it off
upon their first meeting.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:24.684
They're like flowers in the bud stage.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.952
They're like trembling buds.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:30.189
That metaphor is damn good!

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.291
-You're such a pro.
-As expected.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.959
I really like that vibe.

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:38.698
At the moment, Dai seems the quietest?

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.767
Or rather, as the youngest,

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.970
he might be able
to enchant the older contestants.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:47.606
-I see.
-Impressive!

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:49.775
-I'm so excited!
-I am too.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.210
I'm even slightly sweating.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.745
Oh, I know!

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.114
-Shall we decide on a name?
-Yes, let's.

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.249
-Let's do it.
-We need a name.

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.321
We have the keywords "coffee" and "truck."

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.392
And when we think of coffee,

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.761
we think of the word "brew."

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:12.531
Words like "beans" are common.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:14.967
And so on.

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:18.738
This is an approach I propose.

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:19.939
He's like a teacher.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.207
Apologies.

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:27.847
Since we're male,
we could name it "Boys'" something.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.315
That could be cute.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:36.188
But is there anyone
who doesn't define themselves as "he"?

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.791
I go by "he/him" for myself.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.963
Then can "boys" be used
for the participants here?

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.138
What's this, off the bat?

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:55.007
There was seafood art?

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:56.575
What was that?

00:12:56.642 --> 00:13:01.180
When we describe coffee,
we use specific terms.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.381
"Smooth," for example.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.951
I thought maybe we could use
an English adjective.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:06.852
I see.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.155
It's not really easy to remember.

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.157
It's not catchy, right?

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.391
It's not catchy.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:19.965
Autumn?

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.301
-Should we show seasonality…
-No.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.036
Maybe not…

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:33.112
What about "BL"?

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.614
That's so funny.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.349
People who know will get it.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:39.652
What?

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.153
-Latte?
-Oh, latte?

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:43.222
Too obvious?

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.090
Well…

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.928
So we're settled on the acronym "BL"?

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:53.299
As long as it feels right.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.037
Hello.

00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.576
"Friendly" evokes different images
depending on the individual.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:06.579
Not all of us will be able
to spend the day selling…

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:07.513
Hello.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.414
Hello.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.815
Nice to meet you.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.884
I'll be living here starting today.
I'm Kazuto.

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:13.552
Hi.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.753
Hello.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.422
It's so sudden.

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:17.890
Wow, a new cast member.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.325
Nice to meet you.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.163
I'm a chef, and I brought bonito today,
so I wanted to cook together tonight.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.564
What? That's amazing.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.632
That's so nice.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.402
Another good-looking guy arrived.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.638
It will be great if someone can cook.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:33.572
Yes.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.876
When Kazuto arrived,
I was super surprised.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.211
He's the friendly, handsome type.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.913
I think he must be popular.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:44.717
He seems friendly and smart

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.919
but mysterious too.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.053
He seems

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.357
really upbeat, or rather…

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:52.858
I feel like

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:58.631
he must have led
a totally different life from mine.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.900
What's going on?

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.302
You've only exchanged greetings.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:04.670
Don't be quick to judge.

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:10.809
I'm Kazuto. I'm 27 years old.
I manage a restaurant.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:15.714
I joined this show because
I want to find a life partner.

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:19.551
I work from the afternoon
through to the night.

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:23.856
So if he's asleep when I get home,
and we could sleep together,

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.859
I would be very happy.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.395
I'm the type of person
who wants to live with a partner.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:33.065
I may have a crush on someone.

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.801
I'm kind of overwhelmed by my feelings.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:38.404
This is too much. I can't do this anymore.

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:43.175
First, I'm planning to make a salad…

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:44.076
Okay.

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:49.281
…and make an ohitashi
with mushrooms since it's autumn.

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:52.351
Who can wash and cut the vegetables?

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:54.386
I can. I'll take care of the vegetables.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.754
Is there a knife?

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:57.056
I'll leave it to you two.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:00.092
-Need rice?
-Yes. I want someone to cook rice.

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:02.728
I'm going to fillet the fish

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.064
and make sashimi
and something like a carpaccio…

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.132
I'd like to eat carpaccio.

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.001
That's my plan.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.745
-I'm gonna put it here.
-I've never seen it this close.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:23.415
How can the three guys in the back
miss the filleting of the bonito?

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.317
You're right.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.988
Bonito is really easy to fillet.

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.389
-I see.
-Yeah.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.758
If a guy could fillet a fish…

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.727
-It'd be cool.
-It would be wonderful.

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.142
Is it okay to wash this?

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.377
Go ahead. Thank you.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.359
Let's make a toast.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.328
-It's good to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.229
Amazing.

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.363
Thanks for the food.

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.198
Thanks for the food.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.099
Delicious.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.200
I like the meat.

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.268
Yeah, it's so good.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.269
Is it?

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.305
-Good?
-Yeah.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.809
It's amazing that you can
fillet a bonito at home.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:24.777
Seriously.

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:25.978
Is that a sauna?

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:27.646
It's a sauna.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:28.914
Wow, great.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.015
Let's make use of it.

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.784
-Seriously.
-Let's make it routine.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.684
Totally.

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.421
We were talking earlier
about taking turns in the bath…

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.089
Yeah, let's decide!

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.957
-There are two, right?
-Yes, two.

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.893
Who wants to take a bath tonight?

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:43.028
I do. I definitely want to.

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.997
I won't use it.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.498
-Just a shower?
-Yeah.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.067
I prefer a shower too.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.068
I'll take a shower.

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:51.503
It's so cold.
You're okay with just a shower?

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:55.908
Why did you guys want
to participate in this show?

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:04.683
I realized that I've never
faced romance head-on.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.486
I was hoping for a nice encounter.

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.289
So it's amazing to meet you all.

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:12.024
What a great remark.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.158
That was too lovely.

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:14.593
-And you?
-Me?

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.430
In this world,

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:25.037
it's very difficult to find a friend,
let alone a best friend.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:29.141
Whether I find romance or not,

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.944
I want to foster
a strong connection with all of you

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.014
so that our relationship
can endure long after this show.

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:40.552
Oh, did it ring?

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.089
Did it really ring?

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.891
"This is a notice for you."

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.095
"Your first day at Green Room
is about to end."

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:53.031
"Tonight, as you recall the day,

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:56.702
please write a letter
to just one of the participants."

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.106
"However, please do not sign your name."

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.841
Oh, it's anonymous.

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:06.178
-What? Wait!
-Already?

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.479
-Already?
-It's anonymous.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:10.682
-They won't sign their name.
-They won't know who it's from.

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:13.118
-What? That's so thrilling.
-This is just too much fun.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:15.988
"Drop your letter
in the recipient's mailbox

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.322
on their door tonight."

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.358
That's why we have a mailbox.

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:20.659
Interesting.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.928
"Check your mailbox tomorrow morning."

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.964
What if there's nothing there?

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.500
What can you do?

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.102
Please, no.

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.639
"May your heart reach
the person you like."

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.379
-Bye.
-Have a good night.

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:41.813
Good night.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.217
-Good night.
-Good night.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.119
Have a good night.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.987
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:09.741
When you write to someone,
you realize how much you like them.

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:10.943
That's true.

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.445
When you have an outlet, right?

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.447
Like, "Oh, I do like them."

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.416
I'm pretty set on one person.

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:54.453
If someone sent me a letter,
I'd be curious.

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:57.389
I'm worried. What if I don't get a letter?

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.558
That would mean I'm very unattractive.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.326
I think I'll get none.

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:02.661
-What, Shun?
-Shun!

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.630
-He's super negative.
-Shun is negative.

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:05.697
-Shun.
-Shun.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:56.114
I wrote to Kazuto.

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:58.684
He led everyone in the kitchen.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.986
I had a good impression of him.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:15.634
I'M HAPPY WE MET
THANKS FOR THE DELICIOUS MEAL

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:20.238
I was happy because this person
wrote quite a lot to me.

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:24.876
It's a hunch,
but I think it's Dai or Shun.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:26.978
One of those two.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.432
Does that mean
they weren't evenly dispersed?

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:48.900
It's possible.

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:17.763
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU YET,
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:20.499
I wrote to Dai.

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:24.603
I felt the most comfortable with Dai.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:28.306
I'm grateful he's here… I think.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.448
I think I'll get none.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.684
I don't think anyone

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.754
among them would like me.

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:58.270
-He got one.
-He did get one, see?

00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:00.005
He must be happy.

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:05.243
I'm pretty set on one person.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.245
Definitely Shun.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:14.653
First, I'll tell him I'm attracted to him.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.990
Since I couldn't sign my name,
he may not know it's from me.

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:20.392
He's attractive.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.663
Seriously. I totally want
to sleep with him today.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.765
I don't want to sleep alone.

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:45.484
Whoa, three letters?

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.352
-Dai!
-So that's how it goes.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:49.321
Being carefree reigns supreme.

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.635
I received three letters.

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:08.173
I couldn't be happier
if one of them was from Shun.

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.477
DAI, YOU WERE VERY EASY TO TALK TO TODAY.

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:15.180
LET'S MAKE SOME FUN MEMORIES
AT THE GREEN ROOM

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.348
FROM GENSEI

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.283
DAI, WHILE EVERYONE WAS NERVOUS
ON THE FIRST DAY,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.951
YOUR BRIGHT PERSONALITY CHEERED ME UP.

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.786
LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING TIME WITH YOU!

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:22.687
FROM KAZUTO

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.394
DAI, BY TALKING TO ME AND DOING
FUNNY THINGS, YOU HELPED ME RELAX!

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:32.764
THANKS FOR YOUR SMILES.
LET'S CONTINUE TO HAVE FUN TOMORROW.

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:33.665
FROM RYOTA

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:35.901
Shun didn't write to Dai, then.

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:41.206
No one was even my type.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.383
I like the idea of an anonymous letter.

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.918
I agree.

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:55.153
It really strikes a chord.

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.957
The fact you don't know the sender

00:25:59.024 --> 00:26:01.026
makes you think about the letter more.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:03.428
You'd look for clues the next day.

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:07.165
For now, it may be that
they wrote the letters

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.702
because they got along as friends.

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.938
I'm sure there's
a romantic attraction too.

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:16.675
Whether one should go from friendship
to romance is a difficult decision.

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.842
That's right. Yeah.

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:19.611
Once you get into the friend zone…

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:20.512
Yes.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.747
Within five seconds of meeting someone,

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.884
I decide if they're
lover or friend material

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:26.952
from my first impression.

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.187
Know what I mean?

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.222
If your friendship becomes too good,

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:34.859
it's tough to turn it into romance.

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.561
-It's difficult.
-It's awkward.

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:40.365
Especially in situations where
both friendship and romance are possible.

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:43.868
It makes me wonder what will happen.

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:48.873
-I'm concerned about Shun's negativity.
-Yes, it's worrisome.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.875
He mentioned marriage and kids.

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.545
He's thinking so much about the future,

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.948
he may not be able
to casually step into something.

00:26:57.015 --> 00:27:02.153
He may have had painful experiences
with love in the past.

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.457
Everyone is incredibly earnest.

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.359
Not one of them seems mean-spirited.

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:08.526
They're dazzling.

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:11.262
Can that really be?
Their true natures may come out.

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:12.163
-Oh?
-What?

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.732
-It will.
-Right?

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.667
Not a chance. I mean…

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:18.403
There's no way they're all so earnest.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.540
What's up with that dark outlook, Horan?

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:38.857
Okay.

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.259
I'M SORRY I CAN'T JOIN YOU TODAY

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:43.662
I MADE BREAKFAST,
SO PLEASE ENJOY WITH EVERYONE

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:44.863
FROM KAZUTO

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.506
What? How nice!

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:56.641
-No way.
-What a lovely person.

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:57.742
I'd fall for him.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.045
Amazing.

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:01.880
What a proper breakfast.

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.848
I wonder if he woke up really early.

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:06.184
Yeah, it seemed he woke up early.

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:08.053
You didn't hear him, right?

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.889
The miso soup is so good.

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.691
-This dashi, isn't it good?
-Yeah.

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:17.762
I'll be away for the evening today.

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:23.001
I'll join everyone again tomorrow morning.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:26.104
So I'll be stepping out for a little bit.

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.072
-Okay.
-Sure.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.841
Thank you for the food.

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:30.942
Thank you, Kazuto.

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:32.577
Thank you very much.

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:35.080
Considering the times, let's ask the AI.

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:36.081
TRUCK NAME DECISION

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:37.682
Help us…

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.750
A helper.

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:44.489
It's a truck run by five or six men

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:49.227
that departs from a house
called "Green Room."

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:51.429
Can you provide names for a coffee truck?

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.198
What? Is it possible?

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.265
Amazing.

00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:55.900
-By providing information?
-Yes.

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:58.103
-What? Seriously?
-Isn't it crazy?

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:02.874
Oh, here. "Brewtiful" came up.

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:06.978
We "brew" coffee,
and it becomes "beautiful."

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.113
Is it lame?

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.615
Not at all. I love it.

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:13.151
T, I, F, U, and L.

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.589
"Brewtiful" and "U"?

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:18.623
U.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.592
-Nice.
-Yay!

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:23.128
-It's settled.
-We finally decided on a name.

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:25.130
Thank you, everyone.

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.097
Thank you.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.600
COFFEE MAKING TRAINING

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:29.601
Hello.

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:31.903
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.571
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.039
Thank you.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:39.644
We're here to teach you
how to make coffee today.

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:41.312
Thank you.

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:44.883
We'd like to divide you into groups.

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:49.020
Please divide yourselves
into two groups of two and three.

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:52.357
-What should we do?
-Do you wanna do it together?

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.692
Rock, paper, scissors?

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.829
-Two and three?
-Two and three?

00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:59.264
Okay.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:12.243
Over here, I'd like to explain
how to make drip coffee.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:14.879
Pour up to 300.

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:15.947
It smells good.

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:19.384
The aroma is more pronounced than before.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.985
Yes, I feel like it is.

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:22.954
Now it's done.

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.489
It's dark, isn't it?

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.024
-Probably.
-"Probably"?

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.058
Unenthusiastic.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.666
Let's practice.

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.839
It tastes more robust than before.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.243
-Let's start.
-Okay.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.447
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.350
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.552
-Bye for now.
-See you.

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:56.254
-I'll be going.
-Okay.

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.789
-Take care.
-Thanks for today.

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:11.436
When Dai left, he was like, "See you."

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:12.337
Well done!

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.504
It was good, right?

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.472
Impressive.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.841
-Was that intentional?
-Of course!

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.076
Definitely!

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.510
-Yeah.
-That was impressive.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.780
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:25.617
-Thank you for coming today.
-Happy birthday!

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:28.753
Thank you. I'm turning 23.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.656
BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH FRIENDS

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:33.892
Dai, you're all living together, right?

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.894
Anyone you're interested in?

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.295
His friends are direct!

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.296
They are.

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.797
I like these ladies.

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.066
They're definitely direct.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.903
Well, there's one really good-looking guy.

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:47.972
What's he like?

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.574
Is he your type?

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.975
-He must be.
-What's the type?

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:54.345
There's a guy named Shun, and he's…

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.413
He's crazy hot?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.748
What?

00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:01.686
And today, we learned how to make coffee.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.988
We had training with everyone.

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:06.190
The five of us split into groups
of two and three.

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:09.193
And I was next to Shun at the time.

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:12.096
He said, "Do you wanna do it together?"

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.331
That's great!

00:32:13.398 --> 00:32:15.366
-So you two were together?
-Yeah.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.969
-I thought, "It's just the two of us."
-He's interested.

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.470
Yeah, he was smooth.

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:22.674
I don't know,
but it wasn't really like that.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.709
-Maybe he's just a natural.
-He's used to it?

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:28.146
But that makes us dance to their tune.

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:29.647
Yes, I'm a dancing puppet.

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:31.549
I'm furiously dancing.

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.584
-You can't help it.
-Yeah.

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.619
But he's hot!

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:37.488
-He's so good-looking.
-I really want to see his face!

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:41.059
I like pure-hearted people.

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:41.960
Pure-hearted?

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.027
Yes, pure-hearted.

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:45.797
Youthful.

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:46.698
Youthful?

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:49.867
Yes. And someone
who doesn't make me feel insecure.

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:53.805
-Shun.
-You feel strongly about Shun.

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:54.806
I'm into Shun.

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.307
You're worried?

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:59.210
-But you could get anyone you're after.
-No, stop.

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:01.446
-I agree.
-All the guys are seriously attractive.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.881
-I see.
-You're the most attractive, Dai!

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:05.817
I think I can gradually make Shun mine.

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:07.085
I think so too.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.488
He's very calm, really.

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:13.491
I tend to expect too much from my partner.

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:16.627
I'd like someone
who can accept that part of me

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.197
and has a strong will…

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:24.902
I'm hoping that I can find a good partner.

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.090
Nice!

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.133
Whoa, Dai!

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:56.367
He's so built.

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:59.303
What? You don't get a body like that
with just any exercise.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.271
No way.

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:02.540
Dai really works out.

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:24.595
Dai had the ideal body.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:31.903
He's slim with no fat on his face
and has extremely toned abs.

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.306
I definitely like Taeheon's body.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:40.745
His body is so sexy, isn't it?

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:42.747
I was so surprised.

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:45.116
Shun is also quite

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:46.984
toned.

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.754
But I kind of expected it.

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:54.525
I had seen his pecs through his shirt
and the way he watches his diet.

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:59.363
I knew he wasn't a person
who didn't care about his body.

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:05.269
Rather than someone who's ripped,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:11.776
I feel more relaxed
with someone less toned.

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:17.715
Someone with a belly wouldn't bother me.

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:23.354
Kazuto's kindness and sincerity

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.923
are starting to seem fake to me.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.225
Hey.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.861
His personality is too innocuous.

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:34.065
Right, since he's so neutral,
he can't get close…

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:38.536
Well, he's close with everyone
but can't get any closer.

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:43.040
He's 27, so his experiences
may have become like…

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:46.344
-Like a barrier?
-Yes, he may have built a barrier.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.247
Will his nice personality work for
or against him in love?

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:53.251
Yeah, I feel like
we haven't seen his true self yet.

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.920
You're right. We can't see his true face.

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:59.223
-Another wonderful day.
-Thank you so much.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.291
I didn't cook at all.

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:02.593
I brought two kinds.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.062
One is spicy, and the other is not.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.798
Here's to our great day.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:09.967
Let's dig in.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.069
This is so good.

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:12.970
Delish!

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.839
-It's so delicious.
-Yeah.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.942
Are you attracted to women?

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:22.680
My last relationship was with a woman.

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.182
-What?
-Oh, I see.

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:30.188
I like both,
but maybe that sounds a little unfair.

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:36.527
But I mostly date men,
and I feel more comfortable that way.

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:39.997
Do you mean
you're sexually attracted to both?

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:44.802
With men, it usually starts with,
"Oh, he's sexy."

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.838
But with women, it starts with emotions.

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:51.676
Only after falling for them
have I taken the next step.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.679
Is anyone else bisexual?

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:57.748
Me. I'm the same as Dai.

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.918
They could fall in love
with anyone in the world.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.157
It feels like it would increase
the competition.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.858
It raises the bar.

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:12.396
If women are also included,
I don't feel like I could win.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.565
There'd be too many rivals.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.134
I'd be jealous of a female.

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:23.507
There have always been bisexuals
in gay circles, of course,

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:27.612
but it was rare for them to be able
to unabashedly say, "I'm bisexual."

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:30.781
I mean, even if you're gay…

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:36.220
you might tend to see
bisexuals as living in a different world.

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:39.023
So it was nice that they came out
without any hesitation.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.124
Yeah, it was great.

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:43.995
As Shun said, is it true
there'd be more reason for jealousy?

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:47.098
It's possible, especially if you're young.

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:52.203
Shun was like, "If women are rivals,
there's no chance I can win."

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.038
It's probably a source of worry.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:01.445
We need to decide
what to sell in the coffee truck.

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:05.283
So far, we've decided on
hot and iced latte.

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:08.753
And hot and iced drip coffee.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.688
Then for the filters…

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:14.325
It says, "This is a notice for you."

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:16.627
-I haven't heard that sound in a while.
-Yeah.

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:19.530
"You are going to go meet
a new cast member tonight."

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.399
They're going to go meet him?

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:22.833
Is that it?

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.469
-I'm excited.
-Me too.

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:28.105
-He could be a rival.
-I don't like that kind of thing.

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:31.309
It says, "Going to go meet."
Where are we going?

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:03.841
Anyone you're interested in?

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.109
Interested in?

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.210
Yes.

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.346
You look happy!

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.084
Then the person who loses
in rock, paper, scissors will go first.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.418
Who you're interested in.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.821
-Name the person I'm interested in?
-Yeah.

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.356
No, I can't do that.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.125
Dai is carefree and going for it.

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.059
That's it.

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.628
Oh, he's got the advantage.

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:28.866
A game where you say the name
of the person you're interested in.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:31.836
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
Loser says the name.

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.404
Then let's do it with everyone.

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:34.805
With everyone?

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.342
This is a confession, right?

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.878
It's gonna be a confession.

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:42.480
Who do we tell?

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.549
-Let's tell everyone.
-No, not everyone!

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.618
A person you can trust.

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.856
Let's do it!

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.991
Rock, scissors, paper. One, two, three!

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.394
Rock, scissors, paper.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.294
Yes!

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.063
Seriously?

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.264
This sucks!

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.298
DAI AND GENSEI LOST

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.566
Who will you tell?

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.535
I'm going to tell Shun.

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.938
If you open the phone, you'll see it.

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.076
How about you, Gensei?

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.480
Look at both. Have you looked already?

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.049
Are you looking?

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.586
I'm still exploring my feelings,

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.456
but I want to talk to Kazuto a bit more,

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.091
which is what I wrote.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:31.562
I wrote "Shun" on my iPhone
and handed it to him.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:33.431
I just thought I'd go for it.

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:34.932
I figured he already knew.

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:38.302
Hey, wait. Dai is a formidable guy.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.537
That's incredible!

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.905
He's a love monster.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:43.874
Is "attack"
the only word in his dictionary?

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.062
A big smile on his face.

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.430
This is good!

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.766
But what a thrilling development!

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:10.034
Dai is impressive!

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.402
He struck his heart.

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.807
Wow, that's amazing!

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.585
They all have incredible muscles.

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:34.492
Is one of them the new cast member?

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:36.794
A new cast member?

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.538
I want it to be him on the far end.

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:49.907
I know what you mean.

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.208
Farthest end.

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.947
-He's famous.
-He is famous.

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.482
He's unreachable.

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.019
-Isn't he sexy?
-The man is…

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:04.321
-He's sexy, right?
-In a different league.

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.223
He's super sexy!

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.432
We'll get to meet the new cast member
right after, won't we?

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.375
The fave for me and Ryota.

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.810
Him or the slender one.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.779
-Oh, right.
-With the beard.

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.382
We predict one of those two.

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.287
-Excuse me.
-What?

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.389
The man from earlier came.

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:39.390
This is crazy!

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.458
Nice to meet you.

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:43.961
I'm Usak, the go-go boy.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.031
I'm the new cast member.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.033
-This is awesome.
-Thanks for having me.

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.635
-We're happy to have you.
-I'm excited!

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.640
He's one of the most popular
go-go boys in Japan.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.609
This will change things.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.244
Most definitely.

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.745
I can't believe this.

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:03.814
I was like, "He really came."

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:08.152
I've only seen him on stage or on flyers.

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.792
So I'm kind of in a panic.

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:18.028
I'm not calm about the situation.

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:20.264
He's too hot.

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.766
I'm looking forward to the future.

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.301
You were so cool.

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.604
You were so bright on stage. The best.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.173
-We thought it couldn't be you.
-No.

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:31.575
Are you serious? I'm very happy.

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:35.512
-Okay, to our friendship.
-To our friendship.

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:44.355
You were my fave. I wanted it to be you.

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:46.557
-Hey, Dai.
-No.

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:58.802
See!

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:01.105
-This is great!
-Shun!
