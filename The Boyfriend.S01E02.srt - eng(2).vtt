WEBVTT

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.414
He's here.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.149
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.885
-Thank you for joining us.
-Thank you for coming.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.887
-Thanks for having me.
-Thank you.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.322
-I'm Usak.
-I had fun last night.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.823
-I enjoyed it.
-Thanks for having me.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.195
What were you doing?

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.198
-Our morning routine.
-Your morning routine?

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.135
Is this even a routine?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.237
Just chatting.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.073
Let's have lunch together later.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.042
Can he eat the same dishes as us?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.076
Can you?

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.445
I'd like to make a chicken smoothie.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:46.880
I see.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.214
I brought chicken breast.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.682
-What?
-Wow.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.917
How many kilos is that?

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.119
Around 1,700 grams.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.621
I see.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.023
I'll put all this in a pot.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.430
Is this for one day?

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.098
Yeah.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.666
Yay.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.675
-Huh?
-What?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.377
Wow, does that taste good?

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.279
So it's boiled chicken?

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.182
-Boiled chicken? That's quite…
-Too intense.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.485
That's how disciplined he is.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.453
For his job.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:31.391
He may have been pursuing
his own path in solitude,

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.227
so maybe he hasn't had
a serious relationship.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.995
If you date Usak,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.932
you almost have to be
like an athlete's partner, right?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.233
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.871
YOUR COFFEE TRUCK IS READY
PLEASE GO OUTSIDE TO SEE

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.106
Look, there it is.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.908
That's amazing.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.245
Wow, that's cute!

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.080
-It's stylish.
-And the logo is cute.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.181
The logo looks great.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.484
What? Cool!

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.053
-It's mint green.
-This mint is cute.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.889
That's cute. So awesome.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.327
Looks great.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.229
-I like the contrast.
-Awesome.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.097
-I know.
-This is so amazing.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.065
Yeah.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.867
-I like the color.
-Yeah.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.136
-The boys are photogenic.
-This is great.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.404
They're living their youth.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:25.812
If you were to do an illustration here,
what would you draw?

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.213
Can you draw?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.282
I enjoy drawing.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.817
That's good.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.886
DRIP COFFEE, CAFÉ LATTE

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.122
What a wonderful side to him.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.858
The teacher said
to stop it in front of our body.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.627
I don't have any muscle.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.730
What am I gonna do? I don't work out.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.798
Try the other way around. You'll be fine.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.801
Turn it four or five times and squeeze.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.338
Then maybe you can think,
"I want to make it for that person."

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:56.242
The desire to make delicious coffee
for the customer will come across.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.746
Hey, Gensei…

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.948
-Is that how it is?
-His expression…

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.553
We got a message.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.456
"You will start running
the coffee truck tomorrow."

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:16.729
"From now on, you will be required
to live off a budget of 200,000 yen."

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.131
-Got it.
-I see.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.501
If we calculate for a month,
that's 6,600 yen per day.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.136
That sounds doable.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.938
Who wants to manage the budget?

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.040
-Can two of us do it?
-Two works.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.274
I think two is better.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.576
Then I'd be happy to.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.712
Okay. Do you wanna try accounting, Dai?

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.815
Totally. I just have to calculate, right?

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.850
Budget and calculate?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.728
Oh, I'm impressed.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.896
He's using a face mask.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.564
As expected.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:54.934
He's working out.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.436
There's even a gym there.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.828
-Our names are written there.
-Yeah.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.763
There it is.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.101
-"This is a notice for you."
-Okay.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.604
"It will be Ryota's shift today."

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:33.640
I'll do my best.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:35.875
What is it?

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.812
"Ryota, please choose one person
you would like to work with."

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.713
Okay.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:42.682
Seriously?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.050
So that's how it is.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.220
"This is also a chance for you
to talk to the person alone."

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.522
Yeah, that's very important.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.291
This is crazy!

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.159
Whoa!

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:55.795
This is so fun!

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:08.935
"After you pick a person,
turn over their nameplate."

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:12.171
I have to choose, right? I got it.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.807
Anyone in mind?

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.511
-Yes.
-Oh, you do.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.548
Do you just want to work with him,
or do you want to get to know him?

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:23.716
Maybe both.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.088
I see.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.123
This is intense.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:33.760
It'll spice things up.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.662
Okay.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.265
Who will he pick?

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.268
You know, it's almost a confession.

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.537
It means "I'm interested in you."

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.719
-What?
-Hey, look.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.154
Will you work with me?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.321
What?

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:05.158
Me? Oh, I'm happy to work with you.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.263
Our historic inaugural day.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:11.531
Great.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:40.960
Have fun.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.063
Drive safe, Ryo.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.565
-Drive safe.
-Drive safe.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.203
Wow, amazing.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.370
-Wow.
-It's huge.

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:52.738
It's quite a big van.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.844
Wow. What an amazing view.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.245
It couldn't be better.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:04.784
We've arrived.

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.853
It'll be perfect if it's sunny.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:08.888
Shall we get ready?

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.427
The apron fires me up.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.728
-That's true.
-Right?

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:19.932
That looks good.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:21.601
Yeah, it's cute.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.735
Very cute.

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.270
Usak's drawing is amazing.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.471
Seriously.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.907
-I like the color too.
-Cute. He did a good job.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:32.578
Are you ready to open the shop?

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.613
The shop is open.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.814
We're open.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.315
Let's do it.

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:37.450
Let's have fun.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.651
Hello.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:42.054
Would you like a cup of coffee?
It's very tasty.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.224
Our shop opened today.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.926
You're our first customers.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.194
-Seriously?
-Yes.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.730
A small latte, please?

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:51.964
Thank you.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:52.865
Hot, please.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.300
-Hot.
-Same for me.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.505
Do you usually drink coffee?

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:00.740
One cup per day.

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.776
Do you drink lattes or black coffee?

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.645
Lattes?

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.813
The first cup is ready.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.283
Here's the first one.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.018
It's so cute.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.519
We added our hearts.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.691
Oh, they said it was delicious.
I'm relieved.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.159
-You heard?
-Yeah.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:25.831
This one is strong since it has
a double shot of espresso on top.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:29.669
The beans are from Ethiopia,
Brazil, and El Salvador.

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:30.570
Nice.

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.771
Thank you very much.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.307
You're impressive.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:35.207
Thank you.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.209
You were so good.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:38.978
I like these two.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.313
They're a good match.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.614
They're calm.

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:44.216
They look cute looking out
the window, don't they?

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.451
So cute.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.386
Shun.

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.056
Shun.

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:51.624
We have to go.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.758
Where?

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.226
We have to work on coffee.

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.995
I have a headache.

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:57.229
-Headache?
-Yeah.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.832
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:04.770
Shun?

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.172
I'm coming in.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:07.540
Yeah.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.143
Here's water and medicine.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.212
For real? Sorry.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.183
It's all right. Just take this for now.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.285
-Thank you.
-Here.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.320
I'll try to get back soon. Thanks.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.255
Don't worry. Don't push yourself.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.156
Thank you.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.359
See you. Get some rest.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.293
Yeah.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.329
It was really fun.

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:31.330
I had fun too.

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:34.467
It'd be nice
if we could work together again.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.702
I really think so.

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.538
Today, you unexpectedly

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.941
had to choose someone…

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:42.842
Right.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.678
But you're the one…

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:46.646
Really?

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.616
I've been wanting to work with you.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:51.784
Oh, really?

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:54.754
So I turned over your name right away.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.988
I'm happy.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.491
I didn't really have to mull it over.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.734
They'll still be like this
30 years from now.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:11.203
Yes, still running the shop here.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.808
-They spent quite some time together.
-Right.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.444
They've been working hard since morning.

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:23.482
-We're home.
-Welcome back!

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.518
How did it go?

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.919
It was fun, actually.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.421
It was fun.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.189
We had good teamwork.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.824
Yes, there was a lot of teamwork.

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.626
-That's necessary.
-Yes.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.028
We took notes on things
that caught our attention.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.997
-Yes, we did.
-Thank you so much.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:42.034
We'd like everyone
to write your notes here every time.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.937
Today's sales

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.239
were 1,700 yen.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.008
What? Great!

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.914
-Nice work.
-Good job. Thank you.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.949
They made 1,700 yen.

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.084
That's like them.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.585
What were they doing?

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:00.753
Yeah.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.688
Honestly, I was at a loss for words.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:05.157
1,700 yen? Really?

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.894
-There were few customers.
-It's the same as the chicken…

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.530
-There weren't many people there.
-I see.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:13.666
-Good job.
-Thank you for today.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.435
-Yay!
-Yay!

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:21.006
I have big news.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:28.013
At the end of the day, we were asked
to write messages to each other.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.182
TO GENSEI:
THANKS FOR TREATING CUSTOMERS WELL

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.318
TO RYOTA:
YOU WERE SO COOL AND SKILLFUL

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:34.086
Ryota mentioned…

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.824
The handwriting may give away
who wrote the letters.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:43.696
I think it was probably Ryota
who gave me the letter.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.031
I checked the letter,

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:51.036
and I think his handwriting
was the same as the previous letter.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:54.140
Is he interested in me?

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.609
That's what it means, right?

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.612
I see. So he's interested in me.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.214
It's surprising.

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.450
-That's good.
-Great.

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:08.354
I wrote the letter to Dai. Yes.

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.360
-What?
-Huh? Wait a minute.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.327
A misunderstanding.

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.629
-No way. What?
-Huh? Wait.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.164
He saw the handwriting…

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.698
They're not the same at all.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.568
-You're right.
-I was surprised.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.204
When we compare them, they aren't similar.

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.039
Misunderstanding could lead to love.

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.574
-That's it.
-Right.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.310
Love needs a bit of misunderstanding
to make progress.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.046
Good morning.

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:35.181
Good morning.

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.883
"Dai will have today's shift."

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.818
Okay.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.187
This is nerve-wracking.

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:42.888
Yeah, it really is.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.128
Are your eyes closed?

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:52.765
Shun.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.335
Please work with me.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.204
My pleasure.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.140
I'm so glad.

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:02.842
Right. That's what I expected.

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:04.543
-If not, it'd be wrong.
-Yeah.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.579
An iced latte.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.347
Iced latte.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.915
And a black coffee.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.250
Black.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.221
Are you okay?

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.555
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:18.591
Pour it slowly.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.395
Sorry for the wait.

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:25.331
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.200
Thank you very much.
We look forward to seeing you again.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.936
I enjoyed myself the whole time.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.239
In the coffee truck,

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.575
we were so close
we could've kissed 100 times.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:41.380
When I looked up,
Shun's lips were right there.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.016
I probably could've gone for it.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:46.986
Is he into me or not?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.757
I'm… not sure how he really feels.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.162
I've never seen such muscle this close.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:59.398
I can't help but stare.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.566
Incredible.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.569
Are both of you

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.506
your true selves on the show,
in this house?

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.675
I'm very much my true self.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.576
Are you?

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.677
Are you okay?

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.779
Tell me if something's wrong.

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.414
I'm totally fine.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.316
Totally fine.

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:20.085
I think everyone
mostly shows their true colors.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:22.788
You know how you guys
play games together at night?

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.557
I haven't been able to join in.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:27.359
No need to worry about that…

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.128
I need to work out.

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.563
I also often keep to my room.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.368
I'm hoping I can be comfortable
doing my own thing.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.536
Please don't worry.

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:40.005
Feel free to be yourself.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:43.943
At times, I'm not sure
what my true self is.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.010
I know what you mean.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:48.113
Is this the real me,
or am I trying to be considerate?

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.114
I understand.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:51.183
Is being considerate my true self?

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:56.288
I'm not sure who I am sometimes, you know?

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.258
Thoughts like that
pop into our heads at times.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:03.028
In my past relationships,

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:06.598
there were many times
when things would end

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.669
with me being unable to express
my true feelings.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:16.141
Exposing my inner self to others…

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.144
I've never had that experience.

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:21.447
During my stay here,

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:26.085
I'm hoping to be able to honestly express

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:28.787
my feelings to others.

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.423
Since he is famous,

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.926
it's hard to be yourself.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.394
Those in the public eye

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.630
have images of themselves
that people expect.

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:40.833
When subject to that expectation,

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:42.901
they feel they have to live up to it.

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.738
It sometimes becomes even harder
to show your true self.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:49.975
I'm certain Usak
is a very considerate person.

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.144
-9,000 yen?
-Amazing.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:57.516
How many people have you seriously dated?

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.584
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.185
Three.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.387
-Three?
-Yes.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.322
Were they all older?

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:07.192
The first was 30, the second was 28,

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.794
and the third was 23.

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.864
-The third one was the same age?
-Yes.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.032
He was from New York.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.533
You met in Japan?

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.368
Yeah, I met him in Japan.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.203
It was love at first sight.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:19.905
For him.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:25.110
He… really loved… me.

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.714
But what I got out of the relationship

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.016
wasn't enough.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:33.886
I wanted more.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.891
I started having lofty ideals.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:44.663
That's okay.
You were able to avoid wasting time.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.633
Yeah.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.005
I still can't grasp his feelings.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:59.211
Maybe I'm enjoying wondering
whether he likes me or not.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.220
What happened to Shun with the New Yorker?

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.355
What sort of painful breakup did he have?

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.124
He knew his ex loved him,

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:15.327
but something happened
to make him this timid about love.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.029
Something must have happened.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.332
Assuming you like each other,

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:23.402
when a crush tells you
about his past big relationship,

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.571
would that fire you up more?

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:31.310
Or would it throw a bucket
of cold water on your feelings?

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.445
I would've been fired up in my youth,

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.848
but now I'd be like, "Okay, I'm done."

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:37.683
-But Dai…
-We stop trying as we age.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.185
-Dai will get fired up.
-Of course, he will.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.321
-He'll go for it.
-It won't matter to him.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:44.857
He's acting like he's listening,
but he's not.

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:45.891
He only sees himself.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.293
And when he meets
with his opinionated friends,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.430
they'll say, "Who cares? Just go for it!"

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.199
Why don't we try Jenga?

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:58.337
The loser has to say the name
of the person they're interested in.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:03.976
We can't lose.

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.711
It's a battle we can't lose.

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.453
Is there anyone you like?

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.655
-I'm interested in someone.
-Yeah?

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:18.824
I am interested in someone.

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:22.494
-You mean the person next to you?
-Oh dear.

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.930
Have you said something to him?

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.199
I haven't yet.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:31.270
-He won't know otherwise.
-You're right, but I haven't done it yet.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:34.039
There's no way I can say it.

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.275
He's right in front of me.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.343
There's no way.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:40.979
It's Shun.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.482
-What?
-Huh? Wait a sec.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.716
It's Shun?

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:48.787
Shun is someone who does funny things.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.658
He's quirky and offbeat.

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.793
He's interesting.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.296
I want to get to know him.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.531
I like him.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:06.905
I already know he has feelings for me.

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:11.443
So he could be more physical,
more touchy-feely with me.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.613
I… wouldn't mind that.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.417
I'd be okay with him being more forward.

00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.119
See, Gensei misunderstands.

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.502
You're good, Shun.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:38.537
You're weak!

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:46.845
Ready?

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.385
Gensei, wanna join in?

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.763
He's taking pictures.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.367
From that angle, Ryota should know
he's taking pictures of him.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.402
And he's zooming in on Ryota.

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:16.108
I mentioned this last night,

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:21.513
but I wanted to chat about
our budget of 6,000 yen per day.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.017
What should we do about the chicken?

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.118
How much is it?

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:30.622
One pack costs about 800 yen,
and I need three of them.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.724
So we need 2,000 yen?

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:33.625
LAST NIGHT

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:38.430
Gensei and I discussed it last night
while doing the finances.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.500
It's 6,000 yen per day for seven of us.

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:44.603
That's about 800-something-yen
per person per day.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.975
I'm sure many of us will find that tight.

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:54.613
The seven of us need to make do
with 6,000 yen, right?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.614
Yes.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:58.817
These are the expenses from yesterday.

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:00.185
One-third is chicken.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:03.288
Half went on dinner.

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:07.092
We couldn't afford breakfast or lunch.
Only two bunches of bananas.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:10.228
Oh no. Usak's chicken
is a strain on the family budget.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.798
But it's vital for Usak.

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:18.470
We understand you feel you need
to maintain your routine for your job,

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:24.009
but since we live together,
we'd like to be fair to all the cast.

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:32.417
This is what I'm thinking.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:35.687
-Don't do that. I feel so bad for him.
-Oh, Usak!

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:38.724
What if the 2,000 yen
we spend on the chicken

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.760
could be reduced to 1,000 yen?

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:44.696
Then 1,000 yen will be for the chicken,

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:48.100
and the remainder could go toward
food for seven people.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.936
Can I even buy chicken for 1,000 yen?

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:53.905
Please keep in mind

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:58.243
that this 1,000 yen would normally be
for everyone to share,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:03.582
but everyone is willing to compromise.

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:06.585
I would appreciate it
if you could keep that in mind.

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.486
Okay.

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:14.326
The youngest is warning the oldest.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.196
I didn't expect chicken
to pull me back to reality like this.

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.599
The weather is nice today.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:27.305
"Taeheon will take the shift today."

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.608
Yeah!

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.843
-Taeheon!
-Taeheon!

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:36.448
Who is Taeheon going to choose?

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.649
I can't predict it.

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:44.289
Shun.

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.290
Really?

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.391
Please work with me.

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:49.795
I'm kind of happy.

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:50.862
"Kind of happy"?

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.831
Not "kind of." You should just be happy.

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:54.299
I'm happy.

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.567
-I'm happy for you.
-Yeah.

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.370
-Hello.
-Do you have a latte?

00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:01.440
-Latte? Yes.
-One latte and one iced coffee, black.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:02.607
-Black, please.
-Okay.

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:04.943
What size would you like?
There are two size--

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.044
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:07.479
I'm sorry.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:09.014
Please don't worry about it.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.282
How much is a hot coffee?

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:12.317
-First…
-I'm fine with the smaller one.

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:14.753
-Smaller…
-The S-size.

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:17.656
I want the smaller hot coffee too.

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.624
Hot black coffee?

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.560
Latte?

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.695
-With sugar and milk.
-How much?

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:26.798
-For me, I mean.
-Please hold on a moment.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:31.002
So you'd like a latte with sugar and milk.

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.605
Am I correct? Thank you very much.

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:35.540
I should've picked this one.

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:38.677
-Hurry up.
-Yes, I'll get it to you quick.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.249
Ouch.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.484
Are you okay, Taeheon?

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.987
Can you trim and thin it out a little?

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:50.155
Sure, okay.

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:53.124
Were you pretty nervous
when you picked your shift partner?

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.527
Yeah, I was very nervous.

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:57.629
My heart was pounding,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.932
but I had already decided.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.836
I just had to flip the name.

00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:07.038
You're so talented!

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:08.673
Thank you.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:13.144
While you were in the coffee truck,

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.614
did you feel anything?

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:19.651
When a customer
or third party gets involved,

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.688
I get to see a different side of Shun
we don't usually see.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:29.594
He's the type of person
to take work seriously.

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:33.465
The moment you chose Shun…

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.366
Yeah.

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:35.967
…he couldn't stop smiling.

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.202
-Who?
-Shun.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.904
Really? Are you serious?

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.773
He was blushing.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.741
For real?

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:49.381
When you become the truck leader,

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.583
do you know who you'll pick?

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.484
I do.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.286
-You've decided already?
-Yeah.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:55.954
I've decided.

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:57.355
I'm looking forward to it.

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:06.898
I didn't expect you to choose me.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:10.268
One of the reasons I chose you…

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:12.871
It's kind of rude to say this,

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.107
but you have an unfounded confidence.

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:18.209
I admire people like that.

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.711
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:25.717
No one else will believe in you
if you don't believe in yourself.

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:30.555
It felt like that was important.

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.525
You're someone who doesn't

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:36.261
hate yourself, right?

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:38.363
-That's what your confidence means.
-Yeah.

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:42.067
If anything, you love yourself…

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:43.101
Yeah.

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:49.140
That means you're ready
to be loved by someone.

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.112
Makes sense.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.681
That was a bit philosophical.

00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:01.286
Shun lives life at his own pace.

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.555
"It's painful. It's fun. I'm happy."

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:05.657
He's surprisingly expressive.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.025
Yes, that's right.

00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:08.927
He doesn't force himself to fit in.

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.328
He doesn't.

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:14.766
People who adjust to others are popular,
but people who don't are also popular.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.101
-Yes.
-Right?

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:18.036
Especially when they're young.

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:22.574
Oh, they're hunting for chicken.
Affordable chicken.

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:25.844
It's 75 yen per 100 grams.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.712
So two kilos for 1,500 yen.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.914
I'd like to get this one.

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:38.523
CAN I BUY 2 KILOGRAMS
OF CHICKEN FOR 1,500 YEN?

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.292
But we had this talk already.
That's not right.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.328
That's a little…

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.163
Seriously?

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.400
He doesn't get it, does he?

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:50.568
What he's asking is beside the point.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.569
You're right.

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:57.308
Today's main dish is
trumpet mushrooms wrapped with pork.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:02.414
-We can make a side with what we have.
-You're right.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:06.985
It says, "We got it!"
Good! He bought the 850 yen one.

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:12.724
-You did a good job.
-I shouldn't be proud of it, but I am.

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:15.360
Sorry for the long wait.

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:17.962
-Welcome back.
-Thank you for waiting.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.064
Look at this.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.300
You found affordable chicken.

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.601
850 yen.

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:24.803
It's under budget!

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:29.574
-He's so happy. That's cute.
-He's celebrating with a chicken cheer.

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.615
He's incredibly disciplined.

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:47.726
-What is this scene?
-What?

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.662
-What was that cut?
-Why does only Usak get this section?

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.601
What's the penalty?

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:59.170
Let's continue the game
we played at the club.

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:03.174
Tell the person you trust
who you're interested in.

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.643
-All right.
-Okay.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:08.747
-We're playing for real.
-For real? All ready?

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.181
Here we go.

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:14.185
The lowest card loses.

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.921
The one with the lowest number loses.

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:17.822
Is it me?

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.759
You should exchange cards.

00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:21.726
You're in danger.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:24.462
-Seeing that, you think you'd win?
-Dai is also in danger.

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.032
Let's do this at the same time.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.567
-On three?
-Yeah, I wanna see.

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.668
Ready? Go.

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:32.470
That was close!

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:34.038
Shun.

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:36.141
Okay.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:41.346
No one was even my type.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.515
He did say that.

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:46.417
Tell the person you trust the most.

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.519
I don't have one.

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.587
I'll tell Ryo, then.

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:51.156
What game should we play?

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.158
-What should we play?
-This?

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.893
Do you have a crush on anyone?

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.928
-I am interested in someone.
-Oh, I see.

00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:58.663
I'm interested in someone.

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.064
It's Shun.

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.801
I like him.

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:06.771
We should be talking
so we can't hear them.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.740
-What should we do?
-Anything.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.575
-We can still…
-Uno?

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:11.976
Uno for our last game.

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.279
It'll be fun if we play
with this many people.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.313
Uno!

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:16.981
Still playing?

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:22.053
I told him the person
at the top of the nameplates.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.740
-This is the worst.
-That is pretty…

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:46.477
-How Ryota must feel after that…
-Ryota!

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.147
Ryo, sorry, but how was it?

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:51.983
I was happy…

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.451
"Happy"? No way.

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:54.519
…to know.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.321
-That's good.
-You're glad to know?

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.322
Yeah.

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:14.539
That's heart-wrenching!

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:17.775
Now that the members are starting
to know what they feel,

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:20.111
that game is a form of violence.

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:25.884
It's painful
because now Ryota knows the truth.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.653
Right. And he said he was happy.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.322
-It's heartbreaking.
-It must have been so difficult to say.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.626
I couldn't have said "I'm happy"
or anything like that.

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:37.662
Did Dai's attentiveness
when Shun was sick work, then?

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.931
-Oh, you mean Dai's?
-If he chose Dai.

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:43.701
Ever since the beginning,
when Dai said he liked him…

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:47.372
Shun may be the type of person who tends

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:51.676
to like the person who already likes him.

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:57.448
He may be someone
who places importance on feeling loved.

00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:00.251
Everyone's feelings are in motion!

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:01.853
Dai is working it.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.721
-He is making it happen.
-Impressive.

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:09.894
"Gensei will take the shift today."

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.497
Now, huh?

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.999
-Who will he pick?
-What are you gonna do, Gensei?

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:18.469
I'll look after he flips.

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:19.671
I know.

00:32:19.737 --> 00:32:21.306
Please work with me.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.075
Who?

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:25.710
There.

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.611
Dai.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.214
Thank you for choosing me.

00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.549
Good luck.

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.951
I'm excited.

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:33.885
Let's have fun.

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:38.556
I wanted to go with Dai
and make lots of money with him.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.325
We're like the best of friends.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.393
Ryo…

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.463
No, I can't yet.

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.899
That would mean we both like each other.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:50.969
It's not the right time.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.073
What's going to happen?

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:57.041
-Gensei…
-I don't want him to get hurt.

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.143
He thinks he won't be able
to stop himself.

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:03.815
I just sent you a funny picture.

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:09.120
-Look at his face.
-Funny, right?

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.723
Ever since you told me…

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:12.690
Yeah.

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:15.360
I realized you see him that way.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.895
It just suddenly hit me.

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:18.830
Really.

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:21.132
Yeah, maybe three days ago.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:24.502
At first, he was the least likely.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.106
You know how he overreacts at times.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.540
That's true.

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:30.775
"It's so good!"

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.510
-Yeah, exactly!
-"It's delicious."

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:34.779
I didn't like that part of him at first,

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:40.551
but I realized
that's probably part of his charm.

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.021
He's sincere

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:44.822
and kind.

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:46.090
Yeah, that's right.

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.093
Once I started to realize my feelings,

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.929
he seemed better and better.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.998
I see!

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:57.969
The shift from "dislike" to "like"
can be powerful.

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.237
It's unshakable.

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:03.341
-Shun told Ryota who his crush is, right?
-I know.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:04.642
Do you wonder?

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.678
Well, of course I do, but…

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.414
Yeah, I thought so.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.785
I feel like it's going well.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:16.587
When we were playing games yesterday,

00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:19.824
he rested his head here the whole time.

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.459
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:24.028
My heart was pounding the whole time.

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:26.464
I feel like I'm finally

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:29.500
getting closer to him emotionally.

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.236
So you both feel the same?

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:33.271
I don't know.

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:36.340
-I'm still not ready for that.
-Yeah?

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:38.776
I'm afraid.

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:43.748
I want him to show me
that it has to be me.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:46.651
Otherwise, I can't.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.154
But

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:54.158
I can't help but wonder

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.527
what he likes about me.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:02.366
I want to confess my feelings to Shun.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:05.837
I hope to at some point.

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:07.171
Seeing Shun today,

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:12.009
it didn't feel like the right time
to tell him how I felt.

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:16.814
I felt it would be too much
for Shun emotionally.

00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:20.351
He's so kind.

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:21.719
This is so painful.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.155
-Ryota's taken on the listening role.
-Right.

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.760
I can't narrow it down from these three.

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.167
No, they aren't good.

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.135
All of them?

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.103
Yeah, I found a better one.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.605
Are you serious?

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.206
Yup. Hey!

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.107
What?

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.076
What?

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.145
Wait, sorry.

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.149
-What?
-What's going on?

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.783
Was it a picture?

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.352
Inappropriate ones? Is he okay?

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.120
Did he swipe to other pictures?

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:07.165
I happened to open his photo folder.

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:12.170
I found pictures
that could be used for dating apps.

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.839
Like, totally naked.

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:17.909
Really extreme ones.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.512
It made me think, "Oh, he's a player."

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:26.150
It was something I didn't want to see.

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:40.064
With what happened earlier,

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:47.405
I feel like maybe I destroyed everything
we had built up to this point.

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:51.876
Well,

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:53.945
in my past relationships,

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.113
there were…

00:36:58.115 --> 00:37:02.186
many… player types.

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:04.855
Those never worked out.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.960
They're a cause for concern.

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.862
Photos like that, I mean.

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:43.828
I'm sorry.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.671
It made me remember things.

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:06.484
The surfer I broke up with… was horrible.

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.553
I had become dependent on that person,

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.723
and I couldn't get out of it.

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:19.163
But I had decided that from then on…

00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.768
I would avoid those kinds of people.

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:28.372
I want to live a happy life.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:36.681
I want to find someone I could be with.

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:42.520
I was kind of hoping to find
the right person here.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:46.357
I want to reset my life…

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.728
and start all over again.

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:55.299
From what I saw of your reaction earlier,

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:59.670
it's natural to imagine
all kinds of things on your own.

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:00.571
Yeah.

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:05.076
But I'm so attracted to you,

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.812
and I want to know you more.

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:14.418
I know that I'll be able to reassure you,

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:20.524
to prove to you, through my actions,
that you'll be safe with me.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.463
So I hope that you don't worry.

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.642
Won't this make Shun aware
of his own feelings for Dai instead?

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:39.877
I think it will.

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:45.883
The photos perfectly fit into the scenario
he was already worried about.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.784
The worst case.

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:50.421
It came out more negatively.

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:53.190
But it tends to be difficult

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:57.528
to meet people
in ordinary places like work.

00:39:57.595 --> 00:40:03.868
So it's quite natural
to use such apps to meet people.

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:09.273
And taking some risqué photos
for apps like that is totally…

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.475
-Really?
-…expected.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.844
So I don't want Shun
to get upset over that.

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.546
I thought so too.

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.114
-I don't like that.
-No?

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.015
I don't like it.

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.719
Shun has been hurt by players before.

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:25.222
If he's going to be on the show,
he wants to choose the opposite.

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:29.393
He's trying to find someone
who will really care about him.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.061
I think he's pushing away.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:34.665
But his pushing away means
"I love you," right?

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:37.001
-Yes, that's right.
-You think so?

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.669
I agree with him too.

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.271
Shun likes him, but…

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:43.674
There it is.

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:48.712
"Kazuto will be taking the shift today."

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.415
Finally, you can go.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.819
I have to leave again
for about three days for my work.

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.753
Starting when?

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.821
Starting tomorrow.

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:59.824
So I'll do my best today.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.826
How do you feel about everyone?

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:04.094
What sort of move will he make?

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:05.696
Who will he choose?

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.065
Who is it?

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.235
Ryota, please work with me.

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.136
Sure.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.142
Have fun.

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:19.210
I will.

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:22.880
Have a good day!

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.081
Bye!

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.249
Do your best!

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:35.960
They left.

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.529
-Beautiful.
-So beautiful.

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.897
This is nice.

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.566
Are you originally from Tokyo?

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:44.635
No, I'm from Shimane Prefecture.

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.370
-Oh, Shimane.
-It's very rural.

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.572
You came
after you graduated from high school?

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:51.475
No, I came here at about 22 or 23.

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.378
Are you originally from Tokyo?

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.380
-I'm from Niigata.
-Niigata…

00:41:56.447 --> 00:42:00.451
So everyone is from
relatively rural areas.

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.119
Usak said he's from Gifu.

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.721
Speaking of Usak,

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.958
you know how he usually eats around
1.5 kilograms of chicken breast?

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:12.029
You know what?
I tried making it at my restaurant.

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:13.764
The chicken smoothie.

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.733
-How was it?
-It was so disgusting.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.336
I felt so sick after drinking it.

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.572
It's funny you actually made it.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.708
I grossed out my staff.

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:29.480
No matter how gross,
Usak keeps drinking it.

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:32.049
-It must taste bad, obviously.
-It must take a lot of effort.

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:33.350
Usak is admirable.

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:36.086
Hello, how are you?

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:39.323
We have iced coffee.
Three? Thank you very much.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.659
We also have incredibly delicious cookies.

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:44.061
-Did you climb up here?
-Yes, we did.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.931
-That's nice. It's a beautiful day.
-Exactly. It was perfect.

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:50.568
This is the iced latte,
and this is the iced coffee.

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:53.404
-Good luck.
-Thank you very much.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:58.576
Kazuto, you're amazing.
I really like your customer service.

00:42:58.642 --> 00:42:59.977
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.780
We're doing great. What time is it?

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.148
-It's 2:15 p.m.
-2:00 p.m.

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.451
Very good!

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:16.193
-They sold 14 cookies!
-Amazing!

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:20.798
Can I ask you about
your past relationships?

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.133
When was your last one?

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:25.269
Less than two years ago.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.338
How about you?

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:33.544
I had someone I was dating
for about five years.

00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:34.812
Quite long.

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.447
Anyone else?

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.148
So that was the second one.

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.249
The first one

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:44.722
I dated was when I was 19,
and that was the first time.

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:50.027
Yeah, but at that time, I hadn't yet…

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:55.299
I hadn't completely admitted
that I was totally this way.

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.267
-Not "admitted," but…
-I understand.

00:43:57.334 --> 00:44:01.205
I didn't see the point of a relationship
when you couldn't even marry.

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.506
I know.

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:05.609
There was no one else like that
in my hometown.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:10.714
The accepted idea is that a man and
a woman date, get married, and have kids.

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:11.882
Right.

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:14.585
That's the general path of life.

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:17.888
Yes, that track is already laid out.

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:21.458
I was confused about what it meant
for two men to date.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.960
I really…

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:26.530
Yeah.

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:38.542
"Why was I born this way?" In our world,
everyone wondered about that.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:41.645
Everyone has thought that at least once.

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:50.721
My parents are rice farmers.

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:55.392
I'm the eldest son,
so I was supposed to take over the farm.

00:44:55.459 --> 00:45:00.264
But when I realized my sexuality,
I found it difficult.

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.966
Taking over my parents' business

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:08.672
meant there were expectations
from my parents and others around me.

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:13.077
But I betrayed those expectations.

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:19.583
I feel guilt and shame… about it.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.354
In an effort to dispel those feelings,

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:27.791
I want to use the rice
from my parent's farm

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:30.461
and the produce from my hometown

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:35.699
and open my own restaurant.

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.936
That's my driving force or dream now.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.439
That's so nice.

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.640
He's admirable.

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:46.009
He's trying to repay his parents
in his own way.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.113
Everyone opens up to Ryota.

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.181
-They open up?
-A lot.

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:54.551
They're able to speak openly to him.

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.420
He must give off that vibe.

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:58.021
He must!

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.126
-So…
-Yeah?

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:05.462
Is seeing a movie
on a first date good or bad?

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.264
We were discussing that.

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.267
I wouldn't do it for the first date.

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.535
You wouldn't, right?

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:15.739
For a first date, I would go to a café
or some other place we could chat.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.442
Then suggest it
for the second or third date.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.444
Like, "Let's go see this next time."

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.480
Shun, can you please join us?

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.682
No opinions?

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:26.784
Nothing?

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.656
I didn't want to talk to him.

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.693
I can't even make eye contact with him.

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.129
What should I do?

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:44.301
But you talked to him yesterday, right?

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:46.170
Yes, and a lot happened.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.872
I couldn't hang out with him anymore.

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:52.676
But he told me he wanted to make peace.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.711
-So you talked?
-We talked.

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:58.982
But after thinking it over again…

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.685
I mean, we talked about it last night.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.853
And you calmed down?

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.155
We were able to settle things, but…

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:08.091
but…

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.493
I see.

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:10.828
Yeah.

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:15.599
I'm not really sure.

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:24.208
He's still fretting over it.
He's a worrier.

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:31.415
"Shun will be taking the shift today."

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.416
All right.

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:34.551
Please go ahead.

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.253
Here I go.

00:47:41.358 --> 00:47:42.559
-Shun.
-Let's see.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.094
What's he gonna do?

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.395
Who will it be?

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:46.630
How dramatic.

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:18.328
I said the person
at the top of the nameplates.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.903
It was something I didn't want to see.

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.351
-Hey!
-What?

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:42.819
What the heck?

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:45.355
-What was that?
-They left us hanging!
