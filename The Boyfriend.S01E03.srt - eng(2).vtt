WEBVTT

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.949
"Shun will take the shift today."

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:16.916
ARTIST

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.190
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.459
Well, they're a cause for concern.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.128
Photos like that.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.597
MODEL AND CAFÉ MANAGER

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:31.631
It's Shun.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.334
I like him.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.694
Whoa, he went for him!

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.898
-Now we know.
-He chose him?

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.399
We thought it was Ryota, didn't we?

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.535
They're going to deepen their bond.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.969
Definitely.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.707
-Please work with me.
-I'd be happy to.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.985
FROM TAIWAN, HAIR AND MAKEUP ARTIST

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.423
We're off.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.358
Have fun.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.259
Bye!

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.971
I was surprised today.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.375
That Shun chose Dai.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.043
GO-GO DANCER

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.879
-I thought he might choose him.
-Yeah.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:01.381
Really? You all expected it?

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.184
Dai chose Shun,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.752
and Shun chose Dai.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.254
It's a match made in heaven.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.957
Yeah, if both of them

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.960
are interested in each other,

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.563
that may be true.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.064
Yeah.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.209
Excuse me.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:39.352
A cookie and a small iced coffee, please.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.286
Sure.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.056
They should be ready
in less than five minutes.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:43.990
We'll be over here.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.930
I'll give this to them. Where are they?

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.239
Please enjoy.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.081
Shun isn't saying anything.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.515
Is he just waiting?

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.251
-Yes, I think so.
-Right?

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.855
If you're interested in someone,
would you be assertive

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.458
and speak to the person?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.892
To show interest?

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.895
I don't usually.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.697
-You don't?
-No.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.632
Really?

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:27.800
Why is that?

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.136
I don't want them to know.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.407
And did that ever work out?

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.675
Never.

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.077
What about you, Ryota?

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.747
Me? If I was interested in someone?

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:41.648
Yeah.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.385
I wouldn't make my interest obvious,

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.021
but I'd want to spend more time with them.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.390
If I'm interested in someone,

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.860
the amount of time we hang out

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:57.664
and the amount of time we chat
may naturally increase.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.472
-Thank you for today.
-Yeah.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.707
Thank you.

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.180
I was super happy that you chose me today.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.516
I hesitated though.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.984
-You did?
-That's right.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.719
Why did you hesitate?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.823
I'm not really sure sometimes.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.359
Why?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.862
My feelings of interest in you

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.065
may not be real.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:36.836
It may be that
because I know you're interested,

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.573
I may be under the illusion
that I like you too.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:44.310
I'm not sure about my feelings.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.046
Frankly speaking,

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.217
I think maybe a kiss…

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.520
might make it clear.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:56.823
In this case,

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:58.891
if we kiss…

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.929
I'll know if I really like you.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.864
Oh, I see.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.667
What did he say?

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.802
Do it. Before the sun goes down!

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.774
Right now, I'm not sure.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.610
After another two weeks,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.080
I wonder what I'll be feeling.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:24.217
That's where I'm at.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.254
I'm looking forward to finding out,

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:29.722
but I'm anxious.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:35.795
In order to eliminate that anxiety,
I'm trying to be discerning.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.664
That's where I am.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.879
Should we get going?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.014
Okay.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.851
Let's go.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:06:59.752
Stand up.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:01.988
Huh?

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.190
-What?
-Give me your hand.

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:06.793
What?

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:07.760
-What?
-Let's kiss.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.061
-No.
-Why?

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.196
I don't want to.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.265
Not now.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.240
When I feel…

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.412
comfortable, then I'll kiss you.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.723
If we kiss now,
I'll be even more confused.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.595
-Why not?
-Why?

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.997
-Now's the time!
-I guess it's not.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:47.567
He said a kiss now would confuse him,

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:50.603
but it let Dai feel like
his chances are not zero.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.105
Shun is such a schemer…

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.441
He's the type that gets you hooked.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.143
Yes, it'd be easy to get addicted.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.912
-Shun is very complicated.
-It's riveting.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.880
This is great.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.782
It really is great.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:06.118
Both are the type that can get you hooked.

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:10.590
It's a matter
of who's got the stronger hook.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.491
That's true.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.893
Right, both are addictive.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.731
I can see the two of them
French kissing within a few days.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.299
I see, yeah.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:24.971
The tension between them
will keep winding tighter and tighter…

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:27.173
-And smooch!
-…until they smooch!

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.008
I don't know about that.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.465
And…

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.536
Is this your underwear?

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.004
The rest are yours.

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:01.874
He loves him a lot.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.809
That's right.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.078
-Can I hide the bags under your eyes?
-Please do.

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.014
There's a line here, right?

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:09.982
You should start from here.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.150
Below the line?

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.585
-Yes.
-I see.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.320
Start with a darker color,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.124
apply it, and spread it out, okay?

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.826
Then apply pressure with your fingers…

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.628
Oh? It disappeared.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:25.698
Is this makeup
just to remove dark circles?

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.967
I don't need any around the area?

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.535
No, you have beautiful skin.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.704
You don't need it.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.739
Your freckles are adorable.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.042
Your eyebrows are well-grown.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:38.277
Your eyelashes are amazingly long.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.079
I like the width of your forehead.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:46.352
Gensei thinks that Ryota likes him,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.155
but actually, isn't Gensei more into him?

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.957
-Yes, he is.
-I think so.

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:56.362
We've all had a chance to go sell.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.330
Yeah.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:58.364
What location worked?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.600
-The third day was good.
-Yeah.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.335
That's a good place to go.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.637
We could've hit 10,000 yen
even on a weekday.

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.872
-Yeah.
-It's definitely an option.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:10.209
The place Kazuto and I went to
was a park about 20 minutes away.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.811
-So close.
-Yes, it's close.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:15.348
There were many families and couples.

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.785
-What?
-Huh?

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.420
Now? Unbelievable.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:22.655
Hey, hey, hey!

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:27.093
This is a kind of ferry terminal,

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.762
so there's a good flow of people.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.470
People gather at roadside stations
and ferry terminals,

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.606
so if we try circling around a station…

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.778
Whoa, he's lit!

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:49.115
-An assertive one.
-There may be a storm coming.

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:54.053
I think we'll succeed in hitting
our target profit margins…

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:03.095
Not all of us may remember, but…

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:05.531
Oh, good timing.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:07.767
What?

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.037
Someone you know?

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.571
Yeah.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.275
This is insane.

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.612
-Hello.
-Good morning.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.713
Nice to meet you.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.783
My name is Alan.
I'll be living with you starting today.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.118
We're happy to have you.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.320
My name is Alan.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.458
I work for an overseas IT company.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.592
FROM BRAZIL

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:36.462
I'm part Brazilian, Italian,
and a quarter Japanese.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.932
I identify culturally as Brazilian,
but the place I live is Japan.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.535
I'm quite assertive.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:46.472
When I meet someone who's my type,
I'll be like, "I like you."

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:49.208
I felt a spark.

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:50.476
-Wash each other?
-Huh?

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.644
Wanna wash each other?

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:52.912
No, I can't.

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.818
Crazy. Can I sit?

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.753
-You can sit anywhere.
-Over there?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.788
-Let him sit in the middle.
-He's a friend?

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:03.789
He's my friend.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.225
Wow, Usak!

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:09.261
Holy crap.

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:11.130
Hug me. Let's hug first.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.532
This is insane!

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:19.105
I'm so happy. I want to hug everyone.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.973
What were you all doing?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.374
Nice to meet you.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.210
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Alan.

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:25.111
I'm Taeheon.

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.078
-What?
-Taeheon.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:26.979
Taeheon?

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.748
Nice to meet you. I'm Alan.

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:30.483
-I'm Ryota.
-Aw, Ryota.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:32.418
This is crazy, Dai.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.586
It's been a while.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:34.954
This is almost funny.

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:38.090
-Glad you're doing well.
-They know each other.

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.326
-This is crazy.
-How are you?

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.794
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.329
I'm Shun.

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:44.497
-Huh?
-I'm Shun.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:45.464
-Shun?
-Yes.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.066
-I'm Alan.
-Nice to meet you.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:50.069
It's unusual to go around the table
and hug people like this.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.471
I'm Alan. Nice to meet you.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:53.372
I'm Gensei.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.840
-Gensei?
-I'm Alan.

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.308
Nice to meet you.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:59.745
This is insane.
Wait, am I being too loud coming in?

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.214
Not at all. It's perfect.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.415
You're going full throttle.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.583
It's too crazy.

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:11.023
Hey, Alan, you know Usak and Dai?

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.926
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Dai, how did we meet?

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.696
Well, I DMed you on Instagram
because you were hot.

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.031
Oh yeah?

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.300
Was it me first, or was it you? You?

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.201
Yeah.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:25.604
But you were seeing someone at the time.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:26.572
Right.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:30.242
We've been connected ever since
with no weird exchanges or anything.

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.244
"Weird exchanges"?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.484
I wouldn't call our relationship
very deep,

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:43.422
but we did go "all the way."

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.458
So they did sleep together.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.593
They did.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.830
That means that they were
attracted to each other in the past.

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:51.831
Of course.

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:03.976
Usak, that's not fair. It's super unfair!

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.478
Hey, hey, wait.

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.482
-Don't burn yourselves!
-It's hot.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.284
Just bear it.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:14.019
-Let's switch sides.
-Yeah.

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:17.022
-Shun.
-What?

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.190
This must be hard.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:21.060
-You're fitting in better than anyone.
-That's not true.

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.661
I can't believe you just arrived.

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:25.097
Are you all right?
You're not feeling bothered by me?

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.932
-Well, I don't know…
-Or, you know…

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:27.967
Bothered? No.

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:28.901
No?

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.271
When you think about it,

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.174
the next month will be so memorable.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:37.176
You don't get opportunities like this.

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.311
It's incredible. I'm having a lot of fun.

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:42.481
It's so fun.
We should just enjoy it, right?

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.983
We should just enjoy it.

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:50.556
Will Alan's arrival

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.058
be encouragement for Shun and Dai,

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.428
or will it bring about their end?

00:14:56.495 --> 00:15:00.499
But Shun's feelings for Dai
are flourishing, aren't they?

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:04.103
Shun knows that better than anyone,

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.171
but he can't accept it either.

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:09.842
It must be a real struggle
for Shun right now.

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.879
Shun has to do things differently
from his past relationships.

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.714
Until now, others made the effort…

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:18.584
-He was passive.
-Yes, he received the love.

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.553
So I wonder if he can step forward.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.789
There's so much going on.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.424
Yeah.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.726
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.295
Cheers!

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:31.230
It smells good.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.166
-Delicious.
-Yes.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.168
What's your type?

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.169
My type?

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.073
Someone with a kind face

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.510
but with a meaty body, I guess.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.914
Simply speaking, I like big butts.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.951
-That means…
-Usak.

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:53.585
-Sak-sak.
-And Taeheon.

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.087
-Yeah, Taeheon too.
-His is big.

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.755
-Mine is small.
-No.

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:59.725
Buttocks get bigger
if you work hard together.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.695
-So the possibilities are endless.
-Grill, please.

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.929
Grill the meat, please.

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:04.997
All right.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.000
What made you join us?

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:12.538
It takes me a long time
to get into a serious relationship.

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.607
Having a boyfriend is a big deal to me.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:18.410
But I'm 29 now.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:24.350
I don't want to prejudge
what I can or can't do.

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:28.854
I thought I could have experiences
and feelings I'd never had before.

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:30.856
That's why I came.

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:32.825
Bravo! Amazing!

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:35.828
Thank you for joining us.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.363
The sound of the applause

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:39.264
really resonates here.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:44.003
He's been through a lot.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:46.705
He seemed shallow on first impression,
so his words now…

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.707
He's becoming a lot more likable.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.310
So I think self-love is important.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.612
I seriously believe
self-love is important.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:57.616
But I'm afraid
of becoming self-centered too.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.252
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:03.789
I think many people
complained about the government,

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.591
including my family.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:10.029
But what can we do without the government?

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:14.166
We shouldn't place blame on others.
Instead, do what you can.

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:18.270
Get to the point
where you don't need them.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:22.408
Expressing our ego
doesn't mean being selfish.

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:24.309
"This is what we need."

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.612
"This is what we're asking for."

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:28.814
Society won't change if we don't speak up.

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.884
Isn't it too difficult to change society?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.185
But it should change.

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:36.822
Water gets stagnant if it doesn't flow.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.223
Change is necessary.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.926
The flow of water is what keeps it clean.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:44.563
Our current society
benefits the mainstream.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.967
But thinking that way
is disrespectful to mainstream people.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.869
It's not about being disrespectful.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:54.840
When you benefit, you may not
even realize that you're privileged.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.810
You may think that,

00:17:57.876 --> 00:18:02.414
but through the media,
I can tell mainstream people

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:07.386
are becoming more considerate
of LGBTQ people lately.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.021
No, I don't think that--

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.024
-So that's your viewpoint, Dai.
-Right.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:17.930
In the end, the stronger your belief,
grasp, and embodiment of it,

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:21.133
and the more fervently you cherish
what's important to you,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.635
the more infectious it becomes.
Same as love.

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:26.672
What I truly believe…

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.041
When I wake up each morning,

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.943
I perceive myself

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:34.179
as someone capable of influencing
the world I am about to encounter.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:38.417
I choose to believe
that the world I live in is full of love.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.120
It's actually very simple.

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:46.291
And… the meat is cooked just in time!

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.131
-Where are the chopsticks?
-Let's eat.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.067
I should've added this rosemary.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.035
-We don't have any.
-Yes, we do.

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.604
Huh? Rosemary?

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.372
Maybe some oregano.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.611
-I really wish we had added rosemary.
-Yeah, sounds good.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:07.880
-What happened, Dai?
-That was…

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:09.281
From Dai's standpoint…

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:10.849
He may feel upset.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.819
Pass me your plate, guys. I'll serve you.

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:17.656
So juicy.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:18.790
It's delicious.

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:20.726
-It's good?
-Yeah. It's good.

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:23.896
High five!

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.498
-Is it good?
-Thanks.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.101
-Another beer for me.
-I'm going to the bathroom.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.270
-Nice, Shun.
-Very good.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.038
Very nice. This is important.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.440
Dai will be happy.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.611
Dai.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.013
-Shun?
-Hmm?

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.881
I wanted to see you.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.153
I had to calm myself down a bit.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.126
Things happen, right?

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:57.863
I've known Alan for a while.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.332
He always tries to sum things up
nice and neatly.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.366
Alan does?

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.904
I don't think life is so neat.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:08.507
Who cares if it's dirty or messy?

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:11.944
I think it's fine… as long as you're real.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:13.779
Yeah.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:16.281
I know.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:23.622
"How can you know anything when
you haven't experienced any hardship?"

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.224
People tend to think that of me.

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:29.995
So when you sit
and listen to me calmly like this,

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.763
it makes me want to know you more.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:37.636
I don't know what made you
who you are right now.

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:42.341
There must be some reasons.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be you.

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.178
You're different from anyone
I've ever met before.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:51.550
I think you must have experienced
something substantial and heavy,

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:56.488
and those times
must have forced you to be strong

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.590
and made you who you are right now.

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:02.628
I hope I get to hear about
that part of you someday.

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:08.100
If you really want to hear about that…

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.570
I think I could tell you.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.339
How could I not want to?

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.442
Like how I grew up?

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:18.377
Yeah.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.150
From the time I was born,

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.687
I've been without my parents.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.058
Most likely,

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.162
I was abandoned as a baby

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.465
at an orphanage.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.737
That's where I was left.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.506
-You were?
-Yes.

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:51.276
Well, I'm not sure since I don't remember.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:58.216
And I was raised at a children's home
until I was 18 years old.

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.618
An orphanage?

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:02.421
Yeah, that kind of place.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.955
Even there…

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.193
I went through a lot.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.261
I bet.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.865
I don't know what "family" is

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.535
or what familial love is.

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.871
I didn't have a normal life.

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:24.142
I grew up without really picking up
what should be common sense.

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.079
And…

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.114
Well,

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:31.616
after a lot happened,

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:37.989
I ended up coming to Tokyo on my own.

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:43.595
For the past five years
since I've been here in Tokyo,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.897
I've been…

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.267
free.

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:54.339
You know?

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:56.808
I can't even imagine.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.981
I'm going to play

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.884
to help calm you.

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:06.818
I see.

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:08.720
So…

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:10.655
It's calming

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:13.058
while I play.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:16.595
You're cute. Are you creating a song now?

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:25.564
Shall we go back to everyone?

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.531
Why not.

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:28.700
Did you calm down?

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:32.204
-I'm calm now, thanks to you.
-That's good.

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:34.873
Thanks.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.807
Yeah.

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.587
You said earlier
that some people important to you

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.556
had passed away.

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:55.327
Can you tell me who they were?

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.229
My dad and grandpa.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:59.831
I thought it might be your dad.
And grandpa too.

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.300
-I see.
-Well…

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:06.104
My dad suddenly became ill.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:09.975
When he couldn't stand it,
he went to the hospital

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.310
and was told he had
only three months to live.

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:14.980
It was stomach cancer.

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:19.184
In fact, my dad didn't even make it
a month before he died.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:25.624
In the end, he was unconscious
and unable to think.

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:30.061
But my dad said to me at the end,
"I admire you."

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.430
I was…

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:36.034
Oh, it must've been hard for you.

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.242
-Do you need this?
-Yeah.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:47.579
It hasn't even been a year yet.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.385
I hadn't really talked with my dad
since I started working.

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:57.055
I was quite independent.

00:25:58.356 --> 00:25:59.958
I started working young

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:02.160
and couldn't go home often.

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:06.298
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't tell my parents what I was doing.

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:11.202
But they still supported me
behind the scenes.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:12.971
And his last words were,

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.007
"I admire you."

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.788
You never know what will happen in life.

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:35.760
I want to cherish the present moment

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.530
so I won't have regrets.

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:43.468
I'm glad I was able to meet you all.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.175
And then my grandfather passed away too.

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:57.148
I thought this might be an opportunity
that my dad had given me.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.651
Yeah.

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.587
You know, I think so too.

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:06.858
So… I'm grateful to my dad.

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:18.737
Everyone has come here with
their own backstories and experiences.

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.338
When we see that side of them…

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:21.473
You know?

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:22.407
It's true.

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.411
It's difficult to open up
about yourself in the beginning,

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.613
especially about weaknesses
or what's precious.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.517
But as they gradually become friends
and develop feelings for each other,

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:35.587
they feel secure enough
to open up to each other.

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:39.290
When a side of Gensei
or Shun we don't know comes out,

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.059
we realize the others,

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:44.996
like Usak, Kazuto, and Taeheon,
must all have those sides too.

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:47.732
-Everyone has their own experiences.
-Of course.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:51.870
For now, this has helped Shun and Dai

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:55.373
to really connect emotionally.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.010
It felt like they were just themselves.

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:00.945
That scene with the piano.

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:03.014
-It was a gentle moment.
-It was so nice!

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:06.317
It was so beautiful, wasn't it?

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:07.919
It was like a movie.

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:10.321
Yes, it was like a film poster.

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:13.258
There was even space for a title.

00:28:13.324 --> 00:28:15.493
-It's backlit too.
-Wong Kar-wai-style.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.496
Wasn't it lovely how Dai approached him?

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:22.967
The way he asked Shun
why he's the way he is.

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.436
I liked how Dai did that.

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:27.939
Shun was like, "I know."

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:30.709
-I thought it was nice.
-A lot happened.

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:32.477
Their bond has grown stronger.

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.345
-Yeah, quite strong.
-Very much.

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:37.716
Isn't it awkward
to borrow money from friends?

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:40.118
-I couldn't.
-When money is involved…

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.219
Not with friends.

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.587
Is this condensation?

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.089
It's so wet.

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:47.225
You may see their desperation…

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:48.693
-It rang.
-We got a message.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.061
Something rang.

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.629
What?

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.765
-"This is a notice for you."
-Wanna eat this?

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.033
-I want bread.
-Okay.

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:56.401
What?

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.169
What is it?

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.938
-What?
-Come on.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:03.975
"Tomorrow, two of you
will go on a private date."

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:06.778
That was the message?

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:08.046
That's how it goes?

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.581
-That's great!
-That was sudden.

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.750
-Out of the blue?
-Okay.

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:16.321
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on paper."

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:18.757
-Insane.
-We can all write a name?

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:20.492
-Probably.
-Wow!

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:21.392
What?

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:24.395
-I really wanted to go to Disneyland.
-Hey, listen.

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:30.735
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings are mutual."

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.238
Maybe I'll write my own name.

00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:34.606
Your own?

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:39.077
"The announcement will be made
tomorrow morning."

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.145
Do you like this?

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.013
I love it!

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.882
This was way too sudden.

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.617
But it is really exciting.

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:48.620
They're finally going to reveal
their true feelings.

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:49.988
Could be reciprocal love.

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.957
After opening up, they must be
seeing things differently, right?

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.125
Right.

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:59.257
I guess Dai and Shun are solid, right?

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.491
Dai and Shun, yeah.

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:02.694
If they aren't matched,
I'll be like, "What?"

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.129
Yeah, it wouldn't make sense otherwise.

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.165
I hope they end up together.

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:14.739
"Tomorrow, two of you will go
on a private date."

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:20.979
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on paper."

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:29.954
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings are mutual."

00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:35.994
Please read it, Usak.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.895
Okay.

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.464
"Good morning."

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.965
Good morning.

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:44.369
"We will announce the pairs
who can go on a private date."

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.771
It's very sudden.

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.139
Wow.

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.442
-I don't want to do this part.
-Agreed.

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:53.845
I'm feeling so antsy.

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.079
The first pair is…

00:31:57.815 --> 00:31:59.083
Shun.

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:05.623
Okay.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:06.824
My stomach hurts.

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.459
Shun knows who it is, right?

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:09.694
Yeah.

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.930
-Lucky!
-That's right. You'd know.

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:16.567
Then Shun's partner is…

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:27.745
-Who?
-Dai.

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:29.080
Thank goodness!

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:32.917
THE FIRST PAIR
SHUN AND DAI

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.452
I'm relieved.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:35.553
Congrats!

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:39.223
Oh yeah. That was obvious, of course.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.459
Usak took a long pause.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.927
Yay.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.298
It was just as expected.

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:50.335
I knew Shun would write Dai.

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:55.006
Seeing Shun, I sensed that Shun liked Dai

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.742
or that he might have fallen for him.

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:01.579
You said, "The first pair."
That means there's a second pair?

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.880
Okay, I'm going to tap it.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:04.782
I'm curious about the second pair.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:13.591
I chose Ryota because
I've always wanted to talk with him.

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:20.365
I wrote Usak's name.

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.900
The reason is that I find him unexpected.

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:27.071
When I saw Usak eating ice cream,
I thought it was cute.

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.513
"That is all."

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:38.950
That's all?

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.218
Is that what it says?

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:41.786
That's what it says.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.523
Did I misunderstand?

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.727
Is it possible he wasn't interested in me
to begin with?

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:50.628
Or no?

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:54.298
Was it all just in my mind?

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.934
Is that what it was?

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.873
Gensei wrote Ryota's name,

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:03.441
but he ended up like, "What?"

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:08.312
"If he didn't write my name,
did I misunderstand?"

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:09.647
That's what happened.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.182
I wonder which way he'll go.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:13.017
Will he give up?

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:16.654
Or will he realize
he actually likes Ryota?

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.689
I wonder.

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:20.291
-Have fun.
-Are we saying bye?

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.626
-Yep. Have fun.
-See you.

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.827
-Have fun.
-See you, guys.

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.062
Have fun.

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:25.863
How nice.

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:29.333
They must be excited.
It's kind of exciting for us too.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.636
They're cute.

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.311
I'm happy to know
that you wanted to go on a date with me.

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:43.514
Well, I don't have any other options.

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:47.885
Hey, you could've just said,
"I wanted to go out with you."

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.254
YOKOHAMA CHINATOWN
FUKUMANEN

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.322
Let's eat.

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:56.594
I was thinking about this
in the bath yesterday.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.530
I was thinking how you're not very good

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.200
at showing your emotions.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.768
-You know?
-Am I?

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.903
I often thought that at first.

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.539
I wasn't interested in you then.

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:12.977
Yeah, maybe
you really weren't interested then.

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:16.047
I was getting no reactions from you.

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.784
I'm glad that I actually had it wrong.

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:24.689
I came on pretty strong.

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:31.562
Have you never been chased like this?

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:35.533
I have,

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.303
but I wasn't interested,
so I just dropped them.

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.606
What can you do, right?

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:42.507
Yup.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:47.311
I don't really like being pursued.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.715
Until we start dating,

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:53.885
I don't care if I'm at level ten
and they're at zero.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:55.953
-Okay.
-Do you understand?

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.489
-I mean our feelings.
-Okay, I get it.

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.858
Then it should be 50/50 when we're dating.

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:02.960
So it's flipped now?

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:05.196
Right now, your level is

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.632
around eight.

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:10.935
Why do you say that?
That's rather presumptuous.

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.638
You don't know
if I'm at level eight or two.

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:16.240
But you're expressing your feelings
more than me.

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.475
-That's true.
-Yeah.

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.677
I'm not used to it.

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.813
I'm not good at this.

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:29.887
-I think they balance each other.
-Yeah, a nice date.

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.255
Dai can joke with him more.

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:34.225
Yes, they're building a good relationship.

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.196
It's been a while
since I've been to an aquarium.

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:41.365
I wonder what this one is doing now.

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.303
I've never seen a fish like this.

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.405
-It's hiding.
-Amazing.

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.540
-Look, there are sharks.
-Wow.

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:51.809
That's huge.

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:54.779
This kind of aquarium is fun, isn't it?

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:57.081
-It's so fun.
-Their relationship.

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:59.517
Glancing at each other's reflections
in the glass.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:00.885
I know what you mean.

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.153
So cute!

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.689
I wonder if they're swimming hard.

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:06.557
They're swimming!

00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:08.292
They're adorable!

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:10.428
They're coming! So cute!

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.863
They're playing together.

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:17.335
What? Is that one alive? It's super cute.

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.903
Isn't it cute?

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:21.906
I wonder if it's full.

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:24.909
Yeah, cute.

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:27.778
Look at them.

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.114
Oh, it's moving!

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:32.116
Cute.

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.851
They're super cute!

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.954
I wanna take photos.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.294
Is it good? Yummy?

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:45.496
Yummy?

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.265
So cute.

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:57.141
You wrote my name on the paper,

00:37:57.642 --> 00:38:00.511
put it in the bin, and now we're here.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.447
That's something meaningful to me.

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:07.918
If you still feel the same
about me after this,

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.887
it doesn't have to be obvious,

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:15.926
but it would make me happy
if you were open about your feelings.

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:17.928
Like today.

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:21.098
I was so happy.

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.433
I see.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.669
Of course. It's obvious.

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:27.138
Of course that would make me happy.

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:31.008
My heart feels really full right now.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:32.877
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:34.545
I feel happy.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.751
You're very important to me.

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.555
Thank you.

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:46.590
"Thank you"?

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:48.092
That's it?

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:58.336
What is it? What are you doing now?

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.805
I'm thinking.

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.106
Were you?

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:04.342
About what?

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:07.244
-You know what?
-Yeah.

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.047
Well…

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.516
-Tell me.
-No.

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.085
You said, "You know what?"

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:17.388
What?

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:28.232
I saw some bad aspects of him.

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:31.402
It threw cold water on my feelings.

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.804
What?

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:35.473
-What?
-Why?

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.274
-When did that happen?
-When?

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:38.509
Hey, Shun!

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:39.610
What's the issue?

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.645
Let me watch the next ten minutes.

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:43.514
-I know, right?
-Seriously.
