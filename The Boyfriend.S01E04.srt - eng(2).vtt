WEBVTT

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:16.783
Good morning.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.284
DAI - STUDENT
SHUN - ARTIST

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.586
Good morning.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.987
Good morning.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.326
What a nice sound.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.501
"Usak will take the shift today."

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.769
Of course.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:36.836
Usak.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:42.242
"Usak, please choose one person
you would like to work with."

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.143
Okay.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.677
Wait a minute.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.080
Some people aren't here, right?

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.251
TAEHEON, ALAN, AND KAZUTO ARE ABSENT

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:55.955
Okay.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.402
-Please work with me.
-My pleasure.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.138
I'm excited.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.512
I knew I'd be appointed
as the truck leader.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:26.419
I had already made up my mind
that I would choose Kazuto.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.320
ON HIS FIRST NIGHT

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:31.925
Based on first impressions,
Kazuto was my type.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.961
His looks and his aura.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.496
He's a bit mysterious.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.065
That's part of what makes him attractive.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.434
I already have a crush on him.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.709
BUT KAZUTO AND USAK HAVEN'T SEEN
EACH OTHER FOR DAYS DUE TO THEIR WORK

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.048
HE COULDN'T CHOOSE KAZUTO TODAY AGAIN

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.583
Usak is after Kazuto.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.984
First time we're hearing it.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.819
Let those feelings grow.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.495
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.429
Hello.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.730
Thank you for coming.

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.733
-Can I get three cookies?
-Three cookies.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.104
-We apologize for the wait.
-We're sorry for the wait.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:29.008
The one with the letter "L" is the latte.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.210
Thank you very much.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.679
Be careful when you hold it. It's hot.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.514
Are you okay?

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.285
How's life in the house?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.653
In the house?

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.523
How do I put this?
I want to be my natural self…

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.524
Right.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.427
I'm still adjusting.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.861
You still can't relax?

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.397
There are many types of people.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.298
Yes, exactly.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.935
I have to adapt to others…

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.371
Yes, I understand.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:01.507
Sometimes I think,
"Oh, I should avoid doing this."

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.577
I'm not

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:08.581
the aloof guy that I am on stage.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.516
Not in my private life.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.552
I know. You're totally different.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.453
My true self?

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.121
-Your true self?
-Yes.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.857
I'm just ordinary

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.628
and timid…

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.230
Are you timid?

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.465
I think so.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.066
I'm just your average guy.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:33.640
I've never really
opened myself up to others.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.676
I lack that kind of experience.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:40.179
During my stay here,

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:44.050
I hope to be able
to openly express my feelings.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.453
It's scary because you might get hurt.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:53.726
All right.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.162
TAEHEON
DESIGNER FROM KOREA

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.498
ALAN
IT WORKER FROM BRAZIL

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:01.968
Hey.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.612
What? He's unfriendly.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:13.980
Why is he being so cold?

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.315
Yeah, what happened?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.655
It needs some sauce.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.128
But Dai is starting to pick up on it.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.698
That Shun's reactions are odd.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.666
It's tough when they don't tell you

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.035
because you know something is wrong,

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.738
and the silent treatment can be agonizing.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.173
Yes, so painful!

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.207
Agonizing!

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:45.345
That's not the usual reaction
when someone listens to your heart.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:48.414
You would say, "Hey!"

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.550
-Or you'd hug him.
-That's right.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.219
This position was a…

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.220
Major rejection.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:56.689
He was like a real dying person.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:00.893
KAZUTO RETURNS AFTER FIVE DAYS

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.628
-Good morning.
-He's back!

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.630
I was afraid you wouldn't be back.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.500
Welcome back.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:08.735
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:09.635
Right.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.371
-I'm Alan.
-Alan, nice to meet you.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.906
Nice to meet you.
I was looking forward to meeting you.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:17.443
Oh my God. I'm in trouble.
He's my favorite.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:22.982
I like his face, vibe, and everything.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.584
It's like, "Thank you, Lord."

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.186
-There it is.
-What? Nice!

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.454
He's popular.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.889
Super popular.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.457
Wow, you're big!

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.061
-Are you all right? Are you doing well?
-I'm good.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.562
I'm so happy to meet you.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.934
"Alan will be taking the shift today."

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:43.936
-The truck?
-Yep.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.071
Yeah!

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.272
-What's this?
-What?

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.275
"Please indicate
if you'd like to work with Alan."

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:50.209
What?

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:55.381
"If there are multiple candidates,
Alan should pick one."

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.383
-Volunteers?
-That's new.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.319
Have you guys made up your minds?

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:03.956
All right.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.465
-Should we raise our hands?
-Alan should count down.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:13.733
Got it, okay.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.935
Ready? Go.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:22.708
Whoa!

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.981
What? Then, you.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.484
That was quick.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.919
Please work with me.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.954
My pleasure.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.289
What are we gonna do?

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:39.826
All right.

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:41.260
Have fun.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.395
We will.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:45.932
Are you Horan?

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.067
-I'm Alan.
-Alan.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.202
She said Horan.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.838
-What? That's me.
-She confused Alan with Horan.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:56.142
My father is half-Italian
and half-Brazilian.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.043
I see.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.811
My mother is Japanese-Brazilian.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:07:59.812
I see.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.650
I was born and raised in Brazil,
but I'm also part Japanese.

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.854
Oh no.
You're starting to look like my mom!

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:13.125
Since the others are cooking right now,

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.661
why don't we relax?

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:16.929
Relax?

00:08:18.364 --> 00:08:19.932
What do you like to do?

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.468
What do I like to do?

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.403
I like taking baths.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.304
Public baths?

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.241
Public baths, saunas, and bedrock baths.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.378
I usually go on my days off.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.779
-I see.
-Yeah.

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.684
When you're in a sauna,
do you stay for a while?

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.921
There are times when I don't.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.292
I see.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.061
Usak's conversation is boring.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.531
He started with, "What do you like to do?"

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:54.267
-"Do you stay in a sauna for a while?"
-It's cute.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.769
When you go to a sauna,
you usually stay a while.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.607
Are you picky about anything?

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.075
Me?

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.644
Not anymore.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.146
I was really fussy when I was little.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.781
You grew out of it?

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:09.682
Yeah.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.622
He must've been bored talking with me.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.424
I wonder if he had fun.

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:23.563
I was worried that I was giving off
a negative energy the whole time.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.299
Not everyone is a good conversationalist.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.967
Just get your feelings across.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:33.639
When he's on the stage,
he's so glaringly masculine,

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:37.577
but he was quite the opposite
and laid back.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:38.911
It was nice.

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.281
It may be presumptuous to say this,
but it was a plus for me.

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.417
A guy at Usak's level…

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.253
I don't think I'm allowed
to be interested in him.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.889
I feel like I'm not good enough.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.560
Kazuto worships Usak like a god,
but when he actually spoke with him,

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.495
he saw this endearing side to him.

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.631
He took it as a positive.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:09:59.632
A nice gap.

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:00.766
In Kazuto's eyes.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.935
-And Alan is after Kazuto too.
-That's right.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:05.471
There's going to be more turmoil.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.006
Kazuto is a guy magnet.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.608
I see why Kazuto is popular.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.744
He's a well-balanced person.

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.280
-And he can cook.
-Right!

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.148
It's also kind of nice to be busy.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:19.318
Yeah. It doubles the joy
when you see them.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.220
When he came back, everyone applauded.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.955
-"Welcome back."
-That's true.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.225
Makes me think
that romance is like fermented food.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.160
It's about how long you let it ferment.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.328
How deep.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.897
Look.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.366
He's joyfully watering the plant.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:34.500
This is amazing.

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.068
He's so cute!

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:43.643
He's not watering the plants.
He's playing with water.

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.245
He's doing it, so it's okay.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.614
Ready, go!

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:54.720
Amazing.

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.024
Who was first?

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.228
There's one issue I want to bring up.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:08.601
Our daily budget is essentially 6,000 yen
for our meals.

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:13.873
And Usak uses chicken breast
for his shake.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:17.410
The chicken breast keeps causing problems.

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.078
The chicken breast issue…

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:23.215
There's 1,000 yen put aside per day
which he can use on chicken.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.085
But when we went shopping today…

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.920
This one is two kilos.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.189
But look, it's 1,560 yen…

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:31.390
It's relatively cheap.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:34.694
It doesn't matter. We decided
it had to be 1,000 yen or less.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.997
…he left the two kilos of chicken
for 1,600 yen in the basket.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.832
Today's expense was 7,000… how much?

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.167
It was just over 7,000 yen.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.269
Over 7,000 yen? Right.

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:47.173
What took courage for me to say
was completely ignored.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.775
I can't say it doesn't bother me.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.812
I wanted to hear everyone's opinion.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.015
What can I say?

00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:03.589
I'm very sorry
I didn't follow the 1,000 yen budget.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.825
You know, recently,

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:12.231
the cost of the chicken
has been going over budget.

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:16.836
I interpreted that to mean it was okay.

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:21.440
So I was buying the expensive ones.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.010
Yeah.

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:31.417
Is the two-kilo rule important to you?

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:40.493
Objectively, this is hilarious.
But for them, it's a serious matter.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:43.362
Well, the chicken
is an important part of his livelihood.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.797
It's important.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.966
-I will reduce it.
-What?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.667
The chicken.

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:53.873
I'm sorry. It may be too forward
of me to make this suggestion.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.377
If we could add chicken to our meals…

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.881
As part of our daily meals?

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:02.815
And…

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.016
We'd all eat chicken?

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.651
Yeah, and

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:09.255
if I could use what's left
for my smoothie…

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:10.656
Yeah.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.927
This is just my opinion.

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:21.901
I believe two kilos is important for him
to keep in shape for his livelihood.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.704
If we sell one latte, that's 500 yen.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:29.441
If we sell one latte and a drip coffee…

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:34.413
If we can support his job
and what's important to Usak…

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.781
Okay. So?

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:39.652
If we're able to cover the cost
of the chicken with our sales,

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:43.856
I think that would be nice.

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:47.860
That's the best idea. It's ideal.

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.295
I think that's great.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.800
It motivates me to work harder
at the coffee truck.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:59.171
If everyone agrees, it's settled.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:03.175
I'll come up with money-saving recipes
to make up for it.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.848
-Oh, Kazuto.
-He's so sweet.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.217
-I'd fall for him.
-Yeah, I love you, Kazuto.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:13.152
Everyone is falling for Kazuto.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.724
Sorry about today, Dai.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.860
-It's okay.
-I was thoughtless.

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:23.329
No, don't worry about it.

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:27.733
And I appreciate that you brought it up.

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.301
Not at all.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:33.539
I'm glad I was the only one bothered.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.942
I really wasn't thinking, you know?

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.877
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.621
I'm starting to wonder
if I'm even needed at this house.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.626
I've made things uncomfortable.

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:54.894
No, that's not true.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.062
The problem is the chicken, not you.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:02.401
"Usak will take the shift today."

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:07.740
"Please indicate
if you would like to work with Usak."

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.112
Okay, I'll count down from three.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.158
No one. Oh, there are.

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:34.199
I thought, "Oh, he's not into me."

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.403
I looked over,
and Kazuto didn't raise his hand.

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.805
He doesn't even want to chat.

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:42.675
He's not interested in me at all.

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.310
It made me sad.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:47.913
Okay.

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.122
Please work with me.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:59.892
My pleasure.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.698
-Over there?
-Yeah.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.167
-They have to roll up their sleeves now.
-Right.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.401
Let's do this.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.302
Yep.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:11.770
All right.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.372
Whoa, look.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:14.907
Amazing.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:16.508
Crazy.

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.277
Here come a bunch of people!

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.478
Let's get selling!

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:21.947
Excuse me, I can take it for you.

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.417
Isn't it better if you're all in it?

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:28.687
Three, two, one.

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.056
Okay.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.158
It's totally backlit.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:39.631
If you like coffee and juice,
we sell them right here.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.100
We're here!

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.470
-Hello.
-Can I get a coffee?

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.404
A coffee, sure.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.706
The quickest is a small iced coffee.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.908
-Then I'll take a small iced coffee.
-Iced?

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.910
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:53.579
Great.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.382
-What?
-Why? No way.

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.650
Maybe they didn't have enough hands.

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:04.123
I felt like you were a little
down in the dumps in the truck today.

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.092
Like you had a lot on your mind.

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:14.033
I can't help but think
that maybe I don't fit in.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.169
I really think

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.338
that you're the type of person

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.074
who really cares about
how people think of you.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.476
You're someone who really considers

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:29.048
how your words affect others.

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:32.451
And I really hope

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:38.023
that you realize how kind you are.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:43.395
All the guys say you're charming.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.032
But still…

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:51.703
if I don't change myself,

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.741
the environment won't change either.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.278
What you just said
gives me something to work with.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.781
Thank you.

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.650
Not at all. Thank you too.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:08.787
Alan is great.

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.323
It's wonderful that he encourages others.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.825
He's amazing.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:17.696
We can learn a lot from how
he listens to and encourages people.

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.731
It's very instructive.

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.233
With the chicken too.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.771
It's true that they can make
the extra money for the chicken.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.507
It was practical and kind.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:31.243
It was a nice idea.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.446
Dai was also able to say
what was difficult to say.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.615
That's very important too.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.816
You're right.

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.320
By the way,
I wonder what Kazuto is thinking.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.288
-Right?
-He didn't raise his hand.

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.289
Right.

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:47.793
I don't know how he feels about anyone.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.595
He's mysterious in that sense.

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.067
He's drinking it.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.201
-His chicken.
-I'm glad.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.236
Are you okay, Shun?

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:03.942
Shun.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.078
Shun.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:06.979
What?

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.381
The chicken…

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.383
For the shake?

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:13.819
Are you making it today, Usak?

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:26.565
Is it yummy?

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.301
It's good.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:30.802
Take it easy.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:33.539
I'm gonna draw.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:35.574
I don't know.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:42.447
I don't… understand Shun.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:46.952
Today, he completely ignored me
for no reason.

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.887
I'm like…

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:53.125
I want more time alone with him.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:57.329
I'm making my feelings so obvious!

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.665
I don't understand Shun's feelings.

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:01.800
I'm a little tired.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.304
He really doesn't like to be chased.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.239
He's difficult.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:11.043
Shun said he wanted Dai
to express how much he likes him.

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.011
-He did say that.
-Right?

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:16.615
He's giving contradictory opinions,

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.717
but in Shun's mind, it's consistent.

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.618
I see.

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.954
-But it's tough for others to follow.
-It is.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.488
I really don't get him.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.091
And some people may try harder,

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:29.595
but Dai is
quite a happy-go-lucky hedonist.

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:32.364
So he may just say, "Forget it."

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.066
It can't be helped.

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:37.169
But it would be wonderful
if Dai could verbalize the situation

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.905
and make things work out.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:41.773
That's true.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:47.913
"Kazuto will be taking the shift today."

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.648
-I wanna know. Who?
-Here it comes.

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:51.016
-Hold on.
-Who will it be?

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:55.153
"Please indicate if you would like
to work with Kazuto."

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.090
Should I say, "Ready, go"? Is that okay?

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:00.559
Ready? Go.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.730
Wow! So many hands. I'm so happy.

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:06.331
So many.

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:08.467
What should I do?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.581
Who will it be?

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.717
-What?
-What? Shun?

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:30.722
It's my first time with Shun.

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.791
-Please work with me.
-Happy to.

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.596
Please have fun.

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:38.730
I will.

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:42.868
I avoided choosing you two since
you'd have to work two days in a row.

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.671
Oh, Usak and me.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.739
-He's kind.
-Yeah.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.308
-You could do it though.
-Yeah.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:51.243
But it was kind of him.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.144
He's kind.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:58.617
I was surprised you raised your hand.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.786
I just thought, "What?"

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:03.989
But I feel bad for Dai.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.392
He didn't raise his hand.

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.927
How's it going with Dai?

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.529
Nothing is going on.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:11.930
Nothing?

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.467
Well, maybe not nothing.
We went on a date.

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:16.468
So far so good?

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.837
It's not that good.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.172
You guys seem good.

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:22.708
You have good chemistry.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.444
-You think we have good chemistry?
-I do.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.345
Seriously?

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:27.646
I don't think so.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.081
You don't think so?

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:31.683
That's my concern.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.652
I'm attracted to him,

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.188
but Dai is high-energy.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.824
I'm rather low-key.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.425
You are low-key.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.395
So that sometimes his vibe…

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.165
is too much for me.

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.066
I see.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.237
It's their difference in energy.

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:56.675
If the pairing thing happened again,

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.976
who would you pick?

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:00.679
I'm not sure.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:01.747
You're not?

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.886
That feels so good. Incredible.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.892
You went on a date with Shun, right?

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:14.793
Yes.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.561
-Can we talk about it?
-Of course.

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:17.662
Totally.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:23.135
I've only had relationships

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:26.772
with people who were easy to read.

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.107
It's refreshing for you?

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.876
It's refreshing but confusing.

00:23:30.942 --> 00:23:32.110
-You're confused.
-Yes.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.346
It's a new experience.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.949
Exactly. I often don't understand him.

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.686
Are you all friends?

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:43.822
-We're siblings.
-Oh, siblings.

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:46.792
Oh! You all seem to get along very well.

00:23:46.858 --> 00:23:47.692
Yeah.

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:50.462
Here's a small iced latte.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.398
There's one and another.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:54.900
-Thank you.
-Here we go.

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:56.701
-Thank you.
-See you. Thank you.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:58.003
-Take care.
-Good luck.

00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:59.237
Thank you.

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.841
-There's a bunch of people.
-I'm glad.

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:04.209
A big family.

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:05.911
Yes, they are.

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:08.346
What a nice family.

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:09.247
Yeah.

00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:13.652
I keep thinking about Shun and Kazuto.

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:15.153
About one more than the other?

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.054
Yeah.

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.290
Why don't you tell us?

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:19.558
Yeah, you should.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:23.094
I'm interested in Kazuto.

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:24.429
Well, yeah.

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:28.266
I would simply say I'm attracted to him.

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:33.605
Now I know Alan has his eyes on Kazuto,

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:35.574
I can't help but feel intimidated.

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.711
I can't help but think Alan is more fun.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.179
Oh no!

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:42.848
That's not true.

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:45.417
You never know
what will affect someone else.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:49.855
I haven't actually been able
to really talk to him.

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:56.094
It's rather difficult
to create the opportunity.

00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:59.064
By the way,

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:04.703
we were trying to guess
who you're interested in.

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.572
I thought it was Usak.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.309
But you didn't raise your hand
for Usak yesterday.

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:12.244
Yeah.

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:18.750
I may have a crush on someone.

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.151
For real?

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:22.454
-The way he's saying that…
-Who is it?

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.189
-Shun?
-Is it Shun?

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:33.331
-Anyway, let's make dinner.
-All right.

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:34.299
Let's do it.

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:40.805
What?

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.407
-What?
-What happened?

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:43.475
What's wrong?

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.676
I don't know.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.682
-The lights are on in the sauna.
-Yeah.

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:55.787
Welcome back.

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:56.755
Welcome back.

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.356
-We're back.
-Welcome back.

00:25:59.024 --> 00:25:59.891
Welcome back.

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:06.765
-Hey, Alan. Can you come outside?
-Okay.

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:08.500
-What?
-What? What is it?

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.534
Kazuto is…

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.371
Wait a moment, guys.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.506
We'll be waiting.

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.541
The truck crew has stuff to do, right?

00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:21.513
Is this mine?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.881
You can serve over there.

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:26.318
Of course Usak is concerned about
what's going on between those two.

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.889
Oof.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.925
-Sorry, I know it's sudden.
-No problem.

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.998
Man, my heart is pounding.

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.266
-Why?
-Hold on.

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:47.572
WE'RE COMING BACK
CAN THE TWO OF US CHAT?

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:49.407
What?

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:52.344
What does that mean?

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.980
What? This is bound to be exciting.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.514
-This is great!
-I love it!

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:59.351
I'm super pumped!

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:03.722
I wanted to work with you today,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.992
but that would be two days in a row.

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:09.995
I wanted to work with Shun too.

00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:13.198
So next time…

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:18.336
Yeah, I'd like to work with you too.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.805
That's what I'm thinking.

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:22.540
I'm so…

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.443
-Let's go next time.
-Yeah, I'm so happy.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:26.845
You know…

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.347
Since I feel the same way.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.350
Now I know it's not one-sided.

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:34.285
Now I'm a little--

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.654
No, a lot relieved.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.123
Yeah.

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:40.792
Look.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.628
What? Are Kazuto and Alan talking?

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:45.664
Just the two of them!

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.465
Can I hug you to calm myself down?

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.434
-I'm a hugger.
-A hugger?

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.236
Seriously, thank you.

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:57.942
Kazuto and Alan are talking.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.244
That's exciting.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.914
The one who makes the move wins.

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:03.848
That's true.

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:05.684
-That's so true.
-Yes.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.619
Whoever makes the move wins.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.190
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:13.391
Is it cold outside?

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:14.592
It's cold.

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:22.367
-I'm going to go to the bathroom.
-Yeah.

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:39.818
-Nice work today.
-Thank you.

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.586
-Isn't it cold?
-You must be freezing.

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:44.255
-I'm fine, but--
-No, I don't mind at all.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:49.260
What's wrong?

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:54.799
-Well, I wanted to tell you something.
-Yes.

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.436
Among the Green Room participants…

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:01.973
How can I put this?

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.176
…you're…

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.514
my type.

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:10.949
What?

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.051
That's how I feel.

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:15.253
That can't be true.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.055
Of course it's true.

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.458
-I wouldn't lie in this situation.
-Seriously?

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.060
Yeah.

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.261
I'm so shocked.

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:27.832
The first day I came to this house,

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.701
I felt that way

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.103
on first impressions.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.574
-But you left for work the next day.
-That's right.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.843
And then I had to leave for work.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.879
-We missed each other.
-Yeah.

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:44.549
So it was hard to find time to connect.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.987
I want to connect with you.

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:51.222
I think.

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:55.360
My brain froze.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:12.777
I'm not asking you for an answer
or a response right now.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:18.883
I just wanted to tell you
about my current situation.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.419
But in the future…

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:23.321
Do you remember the date?

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:25.890
…if we do that again,

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:29.194
I'll choose you.

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.930
I want a date with you.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.934
-That's all I wanted to say.
-Unbelievable.

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.803
That's all.

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.206
I'm so happy.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.210
I can't believe it.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.280
Of course I'm happy,

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:55.420
but now that I know how he feels,
I wonder how it will affect my feelings.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:31:00.925
I'd like to get to know Usak as well.

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:05.997
That's nice!

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:08.333
-Major upheaval!
-Is that what's happening?

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:11.102
When things happen, things happen.

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.037
Alan can't just twiddle his thumbs.

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.339
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:18.743
I notice that everyone
speaks politely to Usak.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.912
Right? Doesn't that…

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.981
-It feels distant.
-…create a wall?

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.949
There's respect, of course.

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:27.585
So Kazuto and Alan are more frank,

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:31.589
but with Usak,
everyone is like, "Mr. Usak!"

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.825
Only Alan casually says, "Usak."

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.061
Alan gave Usak advice,
but now they're rivals in love.

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.563
That's right!

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.198
So much drama!

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:41.165
I see.

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.600
Yeah, that's right.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.736
They're friends but rivals.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.639
Did you guys have time to talk today?

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:49.908
Yeah, while driving.

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:51.876
Did you talk a lot?

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.046
He said he has a crush.

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.547
-Who?
-Kazuto.

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:57.882
I didn't say that.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.118
-You did.
-No way.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:01.085
He's blushing.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.520
Shun, you're a gossip.

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:05.323
You're such a gossip!

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.491
Oh no!

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.928
I'm joking. He didn't.

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:10.862
-He didn't?
-Really?

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.063
I really didn't.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.164
Yes, I'm serious.

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:16.968
But really liking someone
doesn't just happen overnight.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:20.505
I've never experienced
love at first sight.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:25.143
So every time my friend said,
"It was love at first sight,"

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.445
I'd think, "What the heck?"

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.848
But when I met Kazuto, I felt a spark.

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.050
I was like, "Wow."

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.059
When I met him, my heart raced.

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.495
This may have been my first time.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.597
-He said it.
-In front of people.

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.232
That's bold.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.468
-It could warn off others too.
-Yes.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:52.670
I think so.

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:54.872
I'm glad I got it off my chest.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.077
I'm the type of guy who tells it straight.

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:10.088
-Were you able to be assertive?
-Yeah, I was.

00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:13.091
I hit on Kazuto.

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.993
Wow, what? Kazuto? Earlier?

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:15.893
Yeah.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.462
What did you say to him?

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.931
I told Kazuto that…

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:23.167
Well, that he

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:25.970
made a good impression on me.

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:30.508
And if there's another dating event,

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:33.311
I would write his name.

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.079
You said that, Usak?

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.115
-Nice.
-That happened today.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.150
All in that short moment.

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:41.285
It's like, "Wow!"

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.889
We can draw up a relationship chart.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.491
-Yeah, we can.
-Why don't we?

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.693
We still have some.

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:01.539
-He's drawing it.
-It's just conjecture.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:03.775
Yeah. "Disclaimer:…"

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.077
I need to use the bathroom.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.384
What?

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.319
Wait.

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:18.656
Something wrong?

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:21.225
I also like Kazuto now.

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.193
What?

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:24.095
Really?

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:27.932
He had a change of heart?

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:33.838
My feelings for Shun
hadn't really developed yet.

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:39.944
When I objectively observed
Shun and Dai's daily interactions

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:44.282
and tried to imagine myself dating Shun,

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:49.554
I realized I couldn't see myself
in a romantic relationship with him.

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:56.894
Earlier, when Alan publicly confessed
his feelings for Kazuto,

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:59.964
I couldn't help but think
I didn't want him to take Kazuto.

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.800
I was like, "What are these feelings?"

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:07.305
I realized I'm most interested in Kazuto.

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:08.439
And after that…

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:11.776
-He shared his feelings.
-Right.

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:14.011
-The two of them already made a move.
-Yeah.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:17.648
If we have another date event tomorrow,
it would be bad.

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.150
Yeah, you'd be in trouble.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.587
I wonder what will happen.

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:24.655
Tomorrow…

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.400
How about this?

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.703
I'm gonna show this later.

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:56.087
KAZUTO, I WANT THE TWO OF US TO TALK
COME TO THE TERRACE

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.221
Kazuto's got a handful.

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:58.356
GOT IT

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.824
He's very busy.

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.630
Hey, Ryota.

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:06.898
Thank you for coming.

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:08.733
It's cold, isn't it?

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.537
-Sorry it's so cold.
-It's fine.

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:19.477
I wanted to tell you

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:22.246
how I feel about you right now.

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:25.850
So

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:28.986
I like you very much.

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:32.757
I don't know if I can call it love.

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.460
I'm becoming more and more
attracted to you.

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:42.733
So I want to spend

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:46.204
more time with you.

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:48.973
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.376
I find you kind of adorable.

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:59.217
My feelings for you
became clear to me today.

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.852
That's it.

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:04.589
Seriously?

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:08.593
Thank you. That takes courage.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.761
A lot of courage.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.664
But I'm surprised.

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:17.602
I never would've imagined
you felt that way.

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.503
I didn't really show it.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.438
Yeah.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.612
Wow. I'm surprised.

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:30.681
I'm so surprised.

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:32.583
So shocked.

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.422
I hope we can go on a date.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.391
Yeah, I want to go on a date with you.

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:44.762
That's how I feel.

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:49.367
Thank you for telling me your feelings.

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.268
Yeah.

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.506
The moon is beautiful.

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.674
Thank you, Ryota.

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:57.575
Thank you.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.078
-See you tomorrow.
-Yeah, tomorrow.

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.313
-Good night.
-Thank you.

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:19.797
There are three.
Alan and Usak will be Ryota's rivals.

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:21.232
Formidable opponents.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.566
-Very formidable.
-Yeah.

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:27.471
The ways that each of them
expressed their feelings

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:30.541
were different, and I like that.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.876
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:33.978
It's unusual for Ryota to act like this.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:34.879
Yeah.

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:45.823
This is too much.

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.226
You're my type.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.530
But when I met Kazuto, I felt a spark.

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:55.666
I like you very much.

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.106
I can't do this anymore.

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.743
Kazuto is in a tough position too.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.011
Very tough.

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.153
-I'll read it out loud.
-Go ahead.

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:17.755
"Good morning."

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.657
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:22.193
"The coffee truck will be closed today."

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.728
Our income…

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.296
-"You will…"
-A sleepover date?

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.697
-What?
-Sorry, I said it.

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:27.631
What?

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:31.335
"You will have a sleepover date,
just the two of you."

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.304
-A sleepover date?
-What?

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:36.107
A sleepover date? That's a first.

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:37.041
Crap.

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:40.644
-Oh my God.
-What a surprise.

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.249
"Write the name of the person
you'd like to go with on paper."

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:51.689
"You can go on a date
only if your feelings are mutual."

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:56.827
This is a tough decision for Kazuto.

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.629
What's he going to do?

00:39:58.696 --> 00:39:59.663
What will he do?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.832
I feel like Shun will write Dai after all.

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.667
-I think so too.
-Yeah.

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.636
I wanna go on a date.

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.239
-Do you want to?
-Of course.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.074
Insane.

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.342
-This is insane.
-Totally.

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.611
So intense!

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:14.545
It is.

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:18.115
Does everyone have a name to write?

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:19.683
-Yeah?
-Yes.

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:21.619
Everyone's decided, huh?

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.511
-What?
-They all have to prepare.

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.880
-Since it's a sleepover.
-Oh, I see.

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:40.197
You know you'll be able
to spend a lot of time together

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.967
with the person you like.

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:48.472
It's like, "Yes!"
even before the date starts.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.008
-If we can go…
-Like, "I'm super happy!"

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:53.677
If I get to go on a sleepover date today

00:41:54.311 --> 00:42:00.484
and share some relaxing time
together until we go to sleep,

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.853
I want to share
many things with that person.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.890
I want them to get to know me more,

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.192
and I want to get to know them more.

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:12.129
If I get to have that time today,

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.398
I'd feel fulfilled.

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:20.771
Who's gonna read it?

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.873
I'm not good at Japanese, but…

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.041
Do you wanna try?

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.610
-Can you help me if I can't read it, Shun?
-Okay.

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:30.180
"We will announce the pairs
who get to go on a sleepover date."

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.325
The first pair is…

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.569
Kazuto and…

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:56.840
-Right, Kazuto.
-And?

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.842
-Who is it?
-Who?

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:16.860
FIRST PAIR
KAZUTO AND ??
