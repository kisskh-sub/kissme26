WEBVTT

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.078
"We will announce the pairs
who can go on a sleepover date."

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.116
Kazuto and…

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.953
I want to go on a date with you.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.622
MODEL AND CAFÉ MANAGER

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.592
But when I met Kazuto, I felt a spark.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.294
FROM BRAZIL, IT COMPANY EMPLOYEE

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.930
I'll choose you.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.499
I want a date with you.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.168
GO-GO DANCER

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:40.006
FIRST PAIR
KAZUTO AND ????

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:47.580
All right! Oh man, I'm happy!

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.848
FIRST PAIR
KAZUTO AND ALAN

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.750
It's me, Alan.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.954
-It's Alan.
-Of course.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.624
Kazuto was the first
to show interest in Alan.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.858
Alan!

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.794
I'm so stoked!

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.868
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.937
ARTIST

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.481
"That is all."

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.682
What? Are you serious?

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.484
It says, "That is all."

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.821
-Is that all? What? No!
-No way!

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:28.788
Seriously?

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:33.059
A complete no for Shun, I guess.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.435
What?

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.237
I see.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.206
All right…

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.081
Let's go. Let me carry your bag.
Are you okay?

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.883
-I'm fine.
-I'll carry this top one.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.509
I don't understand him anymore.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.312
THAT IS ALL

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.125
I wanted to go!

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.864
Staying overnight equals "that."

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.724
-Huh?
-Can we talk?

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.658
Okay.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.694
Where?

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.029
Where?

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.397
-In the dining room.
-Okay.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:27.934
What happened?

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.136
Today.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:31.704
What?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.041
-Why didn't I choose you?
-Yeah.

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:40.446
After I gave it a lot of thought,

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.215
I decided not to choose you.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.454
I want to know what happened.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.224
I've felt this way since the beginning,

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.727
but you don't really have
a darkness to you.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.697
Your reactions and energy…

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.767
I feel we have different vibes.

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.269
Remember our date?

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.170
Yeah.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.306
So cute!

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:07.340
Isn't it cute?

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.043
They're super cute!

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:12.512
Is it good? Yummy?

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.314
Yummy?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.149
They're so cute.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.484
I'll feel like I'm having fun,

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:22.288
but then it makes me aware
of our differences in personality.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.892
I'll have fun,
feel the difference, then feel down.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.394
Then it's fun again. Back and forth.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.031
In the end, it's exhausting.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.871
I want to date someone
on a similar wavelength.

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.873
We wouldn't even have to talk.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:44.344
So I don't think

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.748
we're compatible.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.317
We're better off as friends.

00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:01.461
I think that…
might be a better fit for us.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:06.999
Yeah.

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:13.406
You know, last night we said good night
and hugged before going to our own rooms.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.275
In my mind, that sort of thing

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:20.580
was something you do with someone
you have special feelings for,

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.248
beyond friendship.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.819
I was thinking about it in my room today.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:35.461
If you really think
that you just want to be friends…

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.297
If you've made up your mind already,

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:40.366
I'm willing to accept that.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.736
Do you really want to end things

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:48.441
and start again as friends?

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:53.713
Yeah.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.087
Then…

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.796
Thank you for being honest with me.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.106
It's heartbreaking.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:25.845
It was a very good decision
for Dai to back down at that point.

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:29.549
Not many people can do that, right?

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.983
Not usually.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.252
Pressing the person like, "But why?"

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.222
would only have a negative effect.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.890
Exactly. He was amazing.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.393
The best thing to do is to back down.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.730
But being told to remain silent
in an aquarium is tough, no?

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.500
-Very tough.
-You can't help but talk.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.736
If it was an art exhibit
or something like that,

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:51.971
then that may be fine.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:54.173
-Right.
-But at an aquarium…

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.809
-You'd say, "It's cute. It's big."
-You'd be excited.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.344
He's a complicated person.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.213
Could it have a reverse effect?

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:04.450
If Dai really backs off,
it may trigger Shun's interest again.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.719
-I think that's likely to happen.
-Definitely.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.368
Hello.

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.302
Hi.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.004
Were you in your room?

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:25.972
Yeah, I was.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.273
What were you doing?

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.909
I was drawing a bit.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:30.843
Drawing?

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.847
-How are you doing today?
-Today?

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:35.815
Yeah.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.984
It's tough to handle.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.253
How about you?

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.324
FIRST PAIR
KAZUTO AND ALAN

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.996
Well, I knew he would choose him.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.632
It's still frustrating though.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.003
And what?
Did you write Kazuto's name today?

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.237
-Yes.
-I see.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:03.075
Last night, when Alan told Kazuto
he was interested in front of everyone,

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:07.013
I felt like,
"I don't want him to take Kazuto."

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.915
That's when I realized.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.051
But seeing how Alan did it,

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.688
I guess the way Alan behaved
is what resonated most with Kazuto.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:16.722
Yeah.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:19.325
Right.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.530
I wonder if it's a twin or double?

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.799
Let's hope it's two twins.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.101
I agree.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.269
I hope it's a twin.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:32.838
I know.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.340
They're so cute.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.308
Yeah!

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:38.477
Even if it's the same room,
it makes a world of difference.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.279
-Totally different.
-A different story.

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:44.383
Even if you planned on nothing happening,
if they're right next to you…

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.285
-You feel their warmth.
-You get excited.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:49.956
Alan comes off as bold,
but how will he behave?

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.824
Will he be an unexpected gentleman?

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.559
-Right.
-Or will he go for it?

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.595
I wonder which it'll be?

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:57.263
Zekuu.

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.199
Damn, I'm so excited.

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:06.639
Insane!

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.808
Isn't this great? I'm stoked.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:09.909
Wait a minute.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.477
Is that a tub?

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:13.813
It's a hot spring.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.448
Wait!

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.817
It's a private open-air bath?

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.019
-Insane.
-It's so nice!

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.454
-Yeah.
-Which side do you want?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.788
Either one is fine.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.024
It's essentially a double, Usak.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:28.961
Isn't this gap sad? Let's close the gap.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.663
Let's move it.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.365
-It's super light.
-It doesn't move!

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.633
It doesn't? What?

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.469
-Did it move?
-Yeah.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:39.572
All right.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.141
It's turned into a double, Usak.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.476
Sorry.

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:47.913
Are you half-Japanese?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.082
My dad is half-Italian and half-Brazilian.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.985
My mother is Japanese-Brazilian.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.689
Yeah, but I've been in Japan
since I was two.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.025
-You were born in Brazil?
-Born in Brazil.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.160
But I've never been back.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.561
-You haven't gone.
-No.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:03.529
You must want to.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.964
I definitely wanna go.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.332
I want to go before I die.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:11.103
I haven't seen my dad since I was six.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.005
I want to go see my dad.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:18.277
My father was caught when I was six.
He was arrested.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.814
And when my dad was caught,

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:24.784
he told me to take care
of my little sister.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.520
He entrusted her to me.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:32.091
He told me,
"You're the man of the house now."

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.829
"I'm counting on you. I'm sorry."
Then he was arrested.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.664
That's all I have.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:43.369
That promise is the only connection
I have with my dad.

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:46.806
My mom would work
from early morning until late.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.408
I would take my sister to school.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.310
Then pick her up.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.314
For a long time,
we usually had no food for dinner.

00:11:55.815 --> 00:12:00.686
We lived in an apartment complex,
and we had a lot of neighbors.

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:04.056
So we'd visit different families
and have dinner with them.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:05.958
My sister and I.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.527
What about your family?

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:09.462
What do you mean?

00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:12.698
Did you all sit around the table
and eat together?

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:13.933
Until high school.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.435
-Right. When you were in your hometown.
-Yes, at home.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:21.874
Eating together with my family at a table
has long been my dream.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:25.544
I just never had that.

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:30.349
It was rare for me to have dinner
with my family at the table.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.820
So those things are very important.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.692
You know, today…

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.094
How was it when you wrote my name?

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.764
-Well, I was so nervous.
-What did you think about?

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.865
How did you feel?

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.202
You're my type.

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:52.938
I like you very much.

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.611
Did you assume I'd write "Kazuto"?

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.480
Why?

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:04.416
Actually, I like you very much.

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:06.352
I said that in front of everybody, right?

00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:09.755
I know I tend to express
pretty openly how I feel,

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:11.957
but feeling this way is a first for me.

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.426
It was love at first sight.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:19.799
My heart has never been moved
like this before,

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.934
never pounded like this before.

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:27.339
I wanted to let you know how I feel
before we start our time here.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.288
What's going on with you?

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.825
You look like a Buddha statue.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.497
Being Buddha is pretty comfortable.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.200
Really? Isn't that position straining?

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.037
The coffee truck will open tomorrow.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:01.273
But those two are coming back
tomorrow morning, right?

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.876
Yeah, tomorrow.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.878
-Cheers.
-Yay!

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.616
So the reason

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:14.954
I wrote your name today…

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:18.991
I think you're a considerate person.

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.393
For example, when we're eating dinner,

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:24.830
you talk to fill the silence.

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:27.466
You're so cheerful and fun,

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:32.671
but I sensed your brightness
is partly an act

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:36.008
to hide an existing darkness.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.811
I was attracted to that part of you.

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:44.116
My childhood wasn't particularly happy.

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:51.690
I feel like my sister and I
did our best to survive.

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:52.625
Yeah.

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:57.930
But then I grew up
and found people important to me.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:02.268
Now I can say,
"My experiences all led up to this."

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:06.705
If someone asked me if I'd go through it
all again from childhood,

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:09.341
the exact same experiences,

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:10.676
I'd say I would.

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.415
Once I was able to think that way,

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.918
I became very happy.

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:22.621
Now I love the current me. I really do.

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.557
Man, why am I crying?

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.294
I'm sorry. It must be awkward.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.862
It's not at all.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.064
Thank you for sharing.

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.066
You're

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.302
easy to talk to.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.673
Kazuto is a good listener.

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:41.874
It's going well.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.214
What's your type?

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:55.921
Well, I like animalistic facial features.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.357
-That's like me.
-Huh?

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.893
-That's totally me.
-I don't know about that.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:05.864
I've been in two relationships before.

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.634
Completely different
from each other, looks-wise.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:14.840
Do facial features matter to you?
Well, I'm sure they do initially…

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.775
Someone kind-looking

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.979
with muscles.

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.214
Know what I mean?

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.282
No, I don't.

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.217
Just look at your own body, and you will.

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.220
I don't have muscle…

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:30.422
What? You do.

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.425
I'm gonna go wash off.

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:35.160
Your body?

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.929
Tired of the bath?

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.331
-I'm getting hot.
-Really?

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.266
You stay.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.603
-Wanna wash each other?
-Huh?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.239
-Wanna wash each other?
-What?

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:49.108
-Hey!
-Oh my, that's dangerous.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.747
If it gets too intense, I'll make an exit.

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.715
Let's not do that.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.752
-That's dangerous.
-You're right.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.086
You're right. It's risky.

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.903
He hasn't read it yet.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.371
Huh?

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:22.074
I sent a message to Kazuto,
but it hasn't been read.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:23.575
Seriously?

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:29.948
That's painful.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.850
Well, that's how it goes.

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:32.751
Yeah.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.232
Why are you being so seductive?

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.005
Open your shirt.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.506
-Huh?
-Try it.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:00.846
I can't do that like you.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.014
Sexy!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.953
That wasn't sexy at all.

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:10.456
Let's do a massage.

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:11.623
All right.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.225
No need to wear your T-shirt.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.493
No, I need it.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.761
-Why?
-It's cold.

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.729
-It's a massage, right?
-Yeah.

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.665
-You don't need it.
-What do you mean?

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:20.999
Please take it off.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.134
-What? This one?
-Yup.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.202
Are you serious?

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.072
Is this really okay?

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:29.675
This isn't good.

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.044
It's not a good idea.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:33.846
My mom is…

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.014
-Wow.
-…a masseuse.

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:37.983
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.520
It feels so good, but…

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:45.257
I don't want it to be half-assed.
I want to give you a proper massage.

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.862
-Hey!
-Wait a minute!

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.330
Alan is good, isn't he?

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.798
He's an expert.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:53.866
Like his hug.

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.969
He's good at using
his amiable nature to get close.

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:57.870
Really good.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:01.707
But Kazuto seems to have
mixed feelings right now.

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:07.045
Kazuto seems to want to slow things down,

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.981
at least a little bit.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.616
But Alan is pushing hard!

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.251
His foot is on the accelerator.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:15.420
Well, a lot is happening very quickly.

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:20.959
They're coming back today.

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.361
From the honeymoon.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.262
The honeymoon?

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.230
-Honeymoon is not a good word.
-Exactly.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:28.133
But after spending the day together,
they must've gotten closer.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.235
They might be coming back with big smiles.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:34.740
Holding hands?

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.108
-I can see them.
-Are they?

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.177
Are they holding hands?
They're not, right?

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.444
Oh, matching outfits.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.812
Yes, matching. Twinsies.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.848
-That's true.
-They have matching outfits.

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.583
-Coincidence?
-Hey, welcome back.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.084
Welcome back.

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:47.052
Hi.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.987
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.890
You're eating Hamburg steak?

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:52.791
Is it good?

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.760
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.062
-We bathed a lot.
-Yeah.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.664
What does that mean?

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.800
Take it for what it is.
Don't read into it.

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.702
Did you sleep well, Alan?

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.138
-You didn't sleep, did you?
-Sleep well?

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.307
We fell asleep
right after the massage, right?

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:09.274
Massage?

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.744
You mean a massage service at the inn?

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:15.047
No, just on our own.

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:15.981
Yeah?

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:17.983
Was it a tatami room?

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.319
-It was?
-We were naked.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.887
-Naked?
-During the massage.

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:23.455
That was a bit crazy.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.691
He still cares about the room.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.127
Were there futons on the floor?

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:33.799
We had separate beds,
but I joined them as soon as we entered.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:38.904
How nice.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.844
Alan blurts out everything.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.546
-Yes.
-He holds nothing back.

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.815
But he doesn't know
those two also like Kazuto.

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.551
-Right. Alan doesn't know.
-He doesn't know.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:58.824
Have you decided that Kazuto is the one?

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.394
I want to get to know him more.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:04.529
How about you?

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.498
I've made up my mind.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.434
But to make it happen,

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.738
I need to make one last effort.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.877
You know?

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:21.913
Yeah.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.918
I really have to do something.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.387
I see.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.024
Sorry, Ryota.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.992
-Did you wait long?
-Not at all.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:39.031
Well, you went on a date, right?

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.265
-Yeah.
-So…

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:44.536
Have you made up your mind
about who you like after that?

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:46.638
Wanna wash each other?

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:47.606
Sexy!

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.174
Wow.

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.278
No, I'm not sure yet.

00:21:54.112 --> 00:21:54.980
Yeah.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:58.817
I'm kind of more confused.

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:00.519
I see.

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.088
Why is that?

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:04.756
Why?

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:09.161
I'm still not sure why.

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:14.599
Alan was very physically assertive.

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.202
We weren't in the same place.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:20.305
I wasn't… I don't know…

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.773
at that point yet.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.043
So my feelings were rather mixed.

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.380
I need to calm down a bit.

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.650
-You weren't calm?
-Calm?

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:37.022
I haven't been feeling calm
these last few days.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.394
I don't want to rush,
but our time is limited.

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:44.763
I see.

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.867
Maybe I shouldn't say this,

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:52.471
but rather than talking like this,

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.576
if we could just talk
while everyone else is around,

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:59.578
it would make it easier for me.

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.286
He means, "Don't summon me."

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:11.423
He's feeling overwhelmed with everything.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.191
Alan is too much,

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:16.728
and Ryota seems to
be pressing for an answer.

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.731
Does that mean there's a possibility

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:23.001
that Kazuto will start to think
that Usak is the right one for him?

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:27.205
It would be easier
if he could just say no, like Shun,

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.575
but with Kazuto, even if he's not into it,

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:33.278
he's the type of person
who tries to respond.

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:35.347
-He must be suffering.
-He's overwhelmed.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.983
-And Ryota's messages don't help.
-Right.

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:40.485
I wonder what Ryota messaged.

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:43.755
-He really shouldn't have done that.
-He shouldn't have.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.991
I understand why he wanted to though.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:48.193
-Totally.
-You want to know.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.763
And Usak said
he's going to make one last effort.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.666
-He said he was going to do something.
-He did.

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:07.145
PLEASE DISCUSS AND DECIDE
WHO WILL BE TAKING THE SHIFT TODAY

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:08.079
Me.

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:10.315
What?

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:16.121
I'd like to take today's shift…

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.357
for the coffee truck.

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:20.258
Really?

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:25.197
And… with Kazuto.

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:27.399
-What?
-Is that okay?

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:28.867
Wow.

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:31.870
Oh, now he knows.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.506
Yes, of course, I'd love to.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.141
Let's have fun.

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:38.844
Have a good day.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.545
-See you.
-Have fun.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.513
See you.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.782
This is sudden. A new development.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:51.690
Thanks.

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.259
-Did you bring your driver's license?
-Yeah, I did.

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.528
You don't usually drive?

00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:59.431
Only when I'm in my hometown. Yeah.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:03.468
This is my first time
in the passenger seat.

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.940
Let's go!

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:13.912
Smooth driving.

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:15.313
Is it?

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:21.386
Oh, look at the sea.

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.754
Wow, there's the sea.

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.289
It's beautiful.

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.859
It's so beautiful.

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:29.628
Yeah, it is.

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:32.831
Were you mentally prepared
to work the coffee truck today?

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.467
No, I wasn't, really.

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:41.306
I figured the truck was the only chance
I had to talk with you.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.274
Right.

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:45.544
Why did Usak want to go?

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.812
What do you think will happen?

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.781
Something will happen today, for sure.

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:50.782
Definitely.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:52.417
Yeah, it was unusual.

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:54.386
It may not be a big deal,

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:56.955
but it is
definitely something different than usual.

00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:01.793
Isn't that a little far, Usak?

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.995
-Take a picture when I jump.
-Okay.

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.096
Ready?

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.737
This might be a good shot.

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:15.073
Or should we jump together?

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.575
Should we?

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.009
-Go!
-Go!

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:22.280
This is awesome.

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:24.482
-Great one.
-Yeah.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.550
Amazing.

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.518
They're cute.

00:26:30.822 --> 00:26:31.756
A latte.

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.592
A latte, thank you.

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.560
Thank you for waiting.

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.596
-Here's an iced latte.
-Thanks.

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:41.399
Sir, this is the guava juice.
Thank you for waiting.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:43.702
I tried it before. It was delicious.

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.937
Oh, really? Thank you.

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.505
Thank you for waiting.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:48.873
Here you go. Thank you.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.208
Thank you very much.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.343
Thank you.

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:55.280
This makes me happy.

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:56.414
Yeah.

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.617
You know, this is a wonderful time.

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:01.753
-Wait, I like these two.
-They're good together.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.121
Frankly, yes.

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.756
They seem to be a good match.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.627
It's possible that Kazuto,

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.763
who's exhausted,
will find comfort with Usak.

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.409
-I can carry the logbook.
-It's so beautiful. Thanks.

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.616
Beautiful.

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.721
Makes you want to walk barefoot,
doesn't it?

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:39.758
Yeah, shoes are a bit…

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.605
Oh, be careful. The wave is coming.

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:55.473
Oh no!

00:27:57.575 --> 00:27:58.443
I got wet.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.248
You first.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.650
Please.

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.038
Your turn.

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:27.939
Okay.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:37.315
Before I write a message,
I want to talk to you.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.351
Can I write the message later?

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:41.920
Yes, sure.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.190
I'm a real

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.358
snot-- I didn't mean to say "snot."

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.028
Snot?

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.197
I'm terrible at talking.
I meant to say shitty.

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.131
Snotty?

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.635
A snotty instead of shitty speaker.

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.105
It might be incoherent,

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.742
but if you can just give it a listen…

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.110
Yes.

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:10.815
I don't want you to feel like
you have to respond.

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:17.989
When I came to the Green Room,
you were the first person

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.925
who made an impression on me.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:25.296
You're a hard worker.

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:29.067
And your cooking is delicious and amazing.

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:35.173
When you made the effort to talk to me,
I knew you were a kind person.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.708
I think…

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:39.677
you have

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:43.515
a lot of wonderful sides to you.

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:55.760
And at the Green Room…

00:29:57.762 --> 00:30:03.735
everyone still has half their time left.

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:07.305
But for me,

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:11.075
today will be the last day.

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:11.976
What?

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.880
I'm leaving the Green Room.

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.249
Seriously?

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:20.051
Yeah.

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:22.954
-What?
-What?

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:24.622
No way.

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:25.990
-But why?
-Why?

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.593
I came here because

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:33.798
I wanted to be able
to communicate what I was feeling.

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:38.970
So I really wanted to do that today.

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.038
That's why

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.208
I invited you out.

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.611
I wanted to make sure to tell you.

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:52.550
I found someone I like here

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:54.819
and was able to express my feelings.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.287
Now

00:30:58.156 --> 00:31:00.959
I'm satisfied.

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:07.932
Yeah.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:15.473
That's all I wanted to say.

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:23.948
Well, I'm going to write a message.

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:28.486
You go back first.

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.292
I'll head back, then.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:35.760
Thank you.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.434
-What's that sound?
-They're back?

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.269
-Hey!
-Oh, they came back.

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:19.804
Kazuto is the chauffeur.

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.239
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.508
-He's so calm.
-Thank you for your work.

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.610
Welcome back.

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.313
-We're back.
-Welcome back.

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:29.714
Welcome back.

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.282
-We're back.
-Welcome back.

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.751
Welcome back.

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:35.620
Are you tired?

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.455
-Isn't it cold?
-It went by so fast.

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.458
You look serious.

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:44.662
I feel some tension from you, Kazuto.

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:47.332
-What happened?
-Your grown-up face is on.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.470
-Huh? What's happening?
-What?

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:53.371
What?

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:56.040
No way.

00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.443
-What? You're kidding.
-No way.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.978
Hey, what?

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.881
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:09.620
Today, I will be leaving the Green Room.

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:10.688
Are you serious?

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:12.757
I'm serious.

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:14.759
For real?

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:18.763
Yes. I'm going abroad for work tomorrow.

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:20.098
I see.

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:21.165
From the start,

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:25.970
I knew I'd only be here
for a limited time.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.572
-This is sudden.
-What?

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.374
Yeah.

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.476
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:34.746
Today…

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.987
Oh no.

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.490
I can't talk.

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:52.096
Today, I worked the coffee truck
with Kazuto,

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.635
and I was able to accomplish my goal

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:00.471
of conveying my feelings.

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:07.011
I can leave here feeling positive.

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:15.520
It doesn't matter if you're staying here
for love or friendship.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:22.060
I think there are things
you can only say because it's here.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:27.165
I hope that all of you guys will cherish
this opportunity to convey your feelings,

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:31.369
share your thoughts, be happy…

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:36.474
and finish your stay here

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.343
at the Green Room.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.387
Nice to meet you. I'm Usak, the go-go boy.

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:55.393
At times, I'm not sure
what my true self is.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.195
What do you like to do?

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:02.400
What took courage for me to say
was completely ignored…

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:03.367
I'll reduce it.

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.203
The chicken.

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:08.573
If I don't change myself,

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:12.777
the environment won't change either.

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.412
You're my type.

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:15.847
What?

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:18.149
All right!

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.419
It's still frustrating though.

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:23.321
With Kazuto.

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.523
Is that okay?

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.625
What's for dinner tonight?

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:04.128
We made Keema curry today.

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:09.834
We bought chicken breast too.

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.236
Thank you.

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:30.288
Please eat the chicken breast as well.

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.117
Thank you so much.

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:05.089
I can't take this.

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:09.560
Seriously, thank you.

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.100
I'm happy we spent this time together.

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.036
-Thank you very much, Usak.
-Thank you.

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.538
I wish you luck.

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:24.609
Usak. Thank you very much.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.512
-You helped me feel comfortable here.
-No.

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:30.948
We've just started to have fun though.

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:34.785
Thank you.

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:36.654
Thank you, Shun.

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.155
Thank you very much.

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:39.857
We only just got close.

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:41.225
I'm glad we met.

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:43.961
Thank you for caring for me.

00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:46.664
Thank you, Kazuto.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.300
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:56.140
I was able to have these feelings
because you were here. Thank you.

00:38:01.178 --> 00:38:02.146
Good luck.

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.791
Take care. I wish you good luck.

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.893
I'll do my best, and you should too.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.128
Thank you, Usak.

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.095
Take care.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.404
Wow.

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:01.572
What is it?

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:03.040
-Amazing.
-What?

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.175
Huh? What's that?

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:05.710
He drew a lot.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.379
Incredible.

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:13.050
-Is that what he was drawing?
-Amazing!

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:55.459
It was a stimulating half-month for me.

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:58.929
I consider it great progress

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.966
that I was able to express
what I was feeling.

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:05.903
I believe it'll help me
in future relationships.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.940
It'll be a lifelong memory.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.477
I'm sure of it.

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.812
It's very precious to me.
