WEBVTT

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.610
Let's do this.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.644
Water the plants?

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.612
Yeah.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.552
MODEL AND CAFÉ MANAGER

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.490
FROM TAIWAN, HAIR & MAKEUP ARTIST

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.693
It doesn't matter
if you're here for love or friendship.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.098
I think there are things
you can only say because you're here.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.070
I hope that all of you will cherish
this opportunity, share your feelings,

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.640
and finish your stay here…

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.710
at the Green Room.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:50.850
Watching Usak speak…

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:56.489
He expressed what he wanted to
and did what he set out to do. No regrets.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.526
It really left an impression.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:03.863
I believe seeing it through to the end
is important.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.167
There are a few days left,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.871
but I want to do everything I can.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.609
Do we have any syrup?

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.011
There's chocolate syrup.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.312
-Chocolate.
-Café mocha.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.847
That sounds good!

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.315
-I want some.
-We can make it.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.983
I can make café mocha.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.552
-Can you make it?
-Yeah.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.088
-Will you make me one?
-Sure.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.024
Ryota is going to make one for me.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.158
What? I'm jealous.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.394
Ryota is going to make one for me.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.963
Ryota is going to make one for me.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.431
"For me."

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.533
"For me." Are you guys listening?

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:45.405
That's amazing!

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.075
Here.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.579
Thank you.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.114
Should I make one?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:55.615
I see.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.694
Oh, with Ryota's back.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.063
Oh my!

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.431
Implying, "That's my guy."

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.166
Will he see it later?

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.772
PLEASE DISCUSS AND DECIDE
WHO WILL TAKE TODAY'S SHIFT

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.807
Who wants to work the truck today?

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.244
I wanna work with Ryota.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.845
Let's go, then.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:33.813
Yeah.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.116
No objections?

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.586
Why do you want to go?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.421
I want to go with Ryota…

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.322
Cute.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:43.489
You're so cute.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.258
We welcome that kind of opinion.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.159
Why?

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.660
That's so cute.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.029
I want to work with you.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:50.930
Let's go.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.534
Let's have fun.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.109
At first, I misunderstood
that Ryota had feelings for me.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.445
I'm still very attracted to him.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.514
I enjoy talking with him.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.483
It feels comfortable.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.458
Hello. Would you like some coffee?

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.525
Hello.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.061
Coffee is available.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:23.730
Do you have an iced drip coffee?

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.897
We do.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.966
Please give us a few minutes.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.169
Were you taking a walk nearby?

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:31.738
Yes, we were.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:32.672
The two of you?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:33.640
Yes.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.775
How nice. He's smiling a lot.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.145
Here. Thank you for waiting.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.613
-Can you hold it?
-Thank you.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.948
Thank you.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.116
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.117
He's cute.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.119
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.689
-Hello.
-Hello. Would you like some coffee?

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.091
How do you like it?

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.960
It's refreshing. The aroma is great.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.395
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.263
It has some Ethiopian beans, so…

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.399
-I like the acidity.
-Yes, it's acidic.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:04.437
Colombian beans tend to be acidic,
so you may be tasting that.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.039
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.407
Thank you for your time.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.943
You're cute when you're serious.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.280
I usually work like this at my café.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.589
You know what?

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:26.125
From the beginning,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.730
I've wanted to talk with you.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:33.599
Almost since day one.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.401
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:39.706
The first time you asked me
to work the coffee truck with you,

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.842
I was happy and kind of surprised.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.778
And remember the first date event?

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.313
I wrote your name.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.214
What?

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.485
I'm surprised. Are you serious?

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:56.689
Well, we didn't go,
but here at this coffee truck,

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.292
this could be considered a date, right?

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.094
Yes, you're right.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.432
That being said, I have a gift for you.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.367
What?

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.536
I have a gift for you. This.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.441
-Please open it.
-Thank you.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:20.413
Hey, wait.

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.715
I bought it for you.

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:23.850
What?

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.784
Thank you.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:28.087
Oh, it's cute on you.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.422
Is the length okay?

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.524
I'd like to see it as a choker.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.826
It's cute as a choker.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.028
Nice. It looks good as a choker.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:37.497
Is it good?

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.465
-It suits you.
-Seriously? Thank you.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.768
Please use it.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.171
-Usak's words made an impact.
-It's so true!

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.773
This is a nice change.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.176
So I gave you the necklace,

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.978
but can I ask for a favor?

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.279
What is it?

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:56.416
-I want to do your makeup.
-Oh, please go ahead.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:07:00.019
Looking at your face
makes me want to do your makeup.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.821
I want to polish you up.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.956
-Let's do it.
-I'd like you to.

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.625
-May I?
-Please do.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.260
-Then…
-Please make me beautiful.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.194
I will.

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:13.800
I feel like I was clear with him today.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.438
I conveyed my feelings properly. I did.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:22.175
How I wanted to talk to him
and all that's led up to it.

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:23.643
I think I expressed myself.

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.447
Yes. So the rest is up to him.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.282
Well,

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:35.021
if I get a chance to talk to him again,
I would love it.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.992
This is a gift from Gensei.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.561
It's so cute.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:42.962
Yeah, it's very cute.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.033
There was an accessory shop
near our selling spot.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.370
I went to the shop before we opened
and gave it to him after we finished.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.307
What? That's so sweet!

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.908
That's too lovely.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.711
I like giving gifts on ordinary days.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.848
If it suits the person…

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.517
That feeling of wanting
to give someone a gift…

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.686
It doesn't come every day.

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.188
That feeling is special.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.223
Yeah, I agree.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:16.095
I thought maybe it was meaningful
that he gave this to me,

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:20.466
but then he asked,
"Will you do me a favor?"

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:23.703
So maybe it was meant to be
more light-hearted.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.839
To tell you the truth, I wasn't quite sure

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:30.576
how serious his feelings were for me.

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:35.848
I couldn't tell if he liked me or not.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:39.218
-What? I see.
-His feelings didn't get across?

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.553
What?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.190
It seemed pretty clear,
but people perceive things differently.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.626
Maybe it wasn't clear enough for Ryota?

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.629
So he needed to clearly say, "I like you"?

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:50.763
-Maybe.
-I see.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.633
But Gensei's change… evolution.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.835
-He really evolved.
-Thanks to Usak.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:56.802
A parting gift.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.038
A parting gift for everyone's heart.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:02.842
It was planted and started sprouting.
I'm impressed.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.143
Amazing.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.146
When people change,
their faces change too.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.948
Yeah, that's so true.

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.617
-They gain resolve.
-That's really true.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.720
We're talking normally,
but someone has transformed.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.123
I didn't notice myself.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.625
-You're beautiful.
-Thank you very much.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:22.094
-So stylish. Gorgeous.
-This is my business look.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.763
Finally, I'm back in normal mode.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.935
That's amazing
how you made these so quickly.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.404
Hey, Dai, come.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.806
Huh?

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.708
He says you should come here.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:45.985
Please go ahead.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.086
Please go ahead.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.288
Oh, hey, now…

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.724
-This is exactly why!
-Stop it.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:54.327
-He's confusing Dai.
-Yeah!

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.463
But he can't put his hand on him.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.397
What?

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:03.536
There's one thing that bothers me.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.438
We're better off as friends.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:09.308
I think that might be a better fit for us.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.643
And yet,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.011
despite that,

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:15.848
he keeps trying to provoke me.

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:25.758
I really don't get that man!

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:32.164
I'm kind of

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:37.103
getting comfortable with him.

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:39.839
Right now,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:40.873
he's not as…

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.678
Since we said we'd be friends again,

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:49.615
he's no longer as clingy.

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:54.887
If things continue like this,
things might work out.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:01.994
I feel more comfortable
when they don't come on too strong.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.531
At least until we begin to date.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:10.369
Now that there's space between them,
he's more comfortable with Dai.

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:13.673
But it doesn't necessarily mean
Dai also feels comfortable.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.408
It must be hard for Dai.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:18.411
He wants to be lovey-dovey.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:19.779
-Like that.
-Yeah!

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.048
That's a bit…

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.783
That is not good.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.117
No, not good.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.652
They really suck you in.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.721
-And he pushed his hand away.
-Exactly.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:31.057
-He's so bad.
-And look at his face!

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:33.626
-No wonder his face was like this.
-Of course.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.727
It's natural.

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:38.297
So it's okay for Shun to make a move,

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.568
but when Dai puts his hand down,
he pushes it away.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:46.572
It's like he made the move
just so he could push him away.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.709
He's clarifying his stance.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.312
To clearly define his boundaries?

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.015
That's very confusing.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.516
He's difficult.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:01.687
PLEASE DISCUSS AND DECIDE
WHO WILL TAKE TODAY'S SHIFT

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.855
Raise your hand.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.156
I'll do it.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.326
-That was quick.
-So quick.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.694
I'll go.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:09.962
You wanna go?

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.263
Cool.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.298
Taeheon, then.

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:13.666
Who will you choose?

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.167
I choose

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.903
Kazuto.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.574
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:23.776
Then…

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:26.645
you should go.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.720
-Good luck.
-Please work with me.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:35.855
My pleasure.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.491
Kazuto again. Isn't this great?

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:40.493
He's unrivaled.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.862
Shunko!

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:49.568
I couldn't object.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.538
-Why not?
-Well, I wanted to ask him out.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.506
I understand.

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:56.842
I never imagined
Taeheon would beat me to it.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.180
I wonder what his intention is.
Not that I think he has one.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.020
Did you think you'd work today?

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.756
No, I didn't.

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:13.592
But I wanted to work with you.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.761
-Really?
-I haven't yet with you.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.497
I thought the same.

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.167
Welcome to our shop. Oh, hello.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.035
Welcome.

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.770
-Here.
-Thank you.

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:27.006
-Thank you very much. Take care.
-Thank you.

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.475
Hello. Welcome to our shop.

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.878
We have coffee, lattes, and cookies.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.851
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.291
-Hi, sorry for the wait.
-Here it comes. Thank you.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.193
Thank you.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.295
-Thank you.
-I can take it. Thank you.

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.797
-Here, thank you.
-Have a good day.

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:56.402
Do we just let these Hamburg patties stew?

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:59.171
How do you change
after you start dating someone?

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.573
When I date someone,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.542
my life centers around them.

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:06.111
-I see.
-I always adjust to them.

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.314
Unconditional love, you could say.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.415
Unconditional love.

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:14.820
How do you change?

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.589
I can go either way.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.491
I want to be with someone
who gives me butterflies.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:21.293
I totally agree.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.229
-That's important, right?
-It's important.

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:27.099
It's important to find them attractive,

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.635
but also important to find them endearing.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.905
Then I feel like I can forgive them.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.512
Have you talked with your crush lately?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.450
I've been able to talk with him a little.

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:50.990
It's kind of important to spend time
with everyone, but also with my crush.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.192
I'm finding the balance.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.929
I'm trying not to call on him too much.

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.901
Did you tell him how you feel?

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.303
Yes, I did.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.708
I told him I was attracted to him.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:13.012
Were you straightforward?

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.347
Yeah, I told him quite clearly.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.287
-That's tough.
-What?

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.055
-That's tough to do.
-Me?

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.723
I don't know, but…

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.260
I must be clear in situations like this,
or they won't get it.

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.634
Ryota is interested in someone,

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:39.305
and I could tell he was really into them.

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:41.907
That hurt my feelings.

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.344
Yeah… I think so.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.247
But he was wearing the necklace.

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:51.884
I'm not sure what it means for him.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:56.455
Gensei realized that Ryota likes someone.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:59.525
But Ryota is wearing his necklace.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:03.896
-But these things happen, don't they?
-They do.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:05.898
Sorry for the wait.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.467
-Come again.
-Take care.

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.478
-There they are.
-Here they come.

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.512
-Yes!
-A new person?

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:24.717
So this is where they join?

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:46.505
Welcome.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:47.539
Hello.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.078
-One iced latte, please.
-An iced latte. Sure.

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.947
Cookies are on sale now.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.048
I'll buy one, then.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:58.517
-Really? Thank you. It's 600 yen.
-Okay.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.388
Thank you.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.028
Here's your change.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.897
Should I wait here for the coffee?

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.099
-We'll bring it to you.
-Thank you.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.067
Thank you.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.610
Maybe he's a new cast member?

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.112
-Is that what's happening?
-I don't know.

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.647
Is that why he has a suitcase?

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.315
Should we go together?

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.520
-Thank you.
-Excuse us.

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.155
Thank you for waiting.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.723
Your iced latte.

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:39.324
Actually…

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.763
I'm Ikuo. I'll be living
with you guys starting today.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.831
Wow.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.933
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:49.968
My hunch was right.

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.272
-I'm glad to meet you.
-Wow, glad to meet you too.

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.644
I wonder how their day went.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.711
I'm curious.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:06.118
-Look, they're back.
-We're back.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.821
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:10.222
-Welcome back.
-Home we are.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.990
-That was your outfit, Taeheon?
-Cute.

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:14.293
You look different. So cute.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:16.395
-Great. You look wonderful.
-So sleek.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.000
We have an important announcement.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.068
-No, don't.
-What?

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:24.570
-Don't.
-What?

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:26.205
What?

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:33.612
Good evening. I'm Ikuo.
I'll be joining you as of today.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:34.780
Nice to meet you.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.648
That's hilarious.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:37.549
What a surprise.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:40.285
-A refreshing type.
-Ikuo.

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.754
He's different from the others.

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.990
-Do you know him?
-No, I don't.

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:48.160
You were talking as if you knew him.

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:50.762
I just thought the timing was hilarious.

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.030
Glad to meet you.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.632
We're happy to have you.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.567
I'm Ikuo.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.136
I'm 22.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:58.871
I work at a burger shop.

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:01.440
I love getting butterflies.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.409
I want to sleep together,
take baths together…

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:07.946
I like to enjoy the simple things.

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:11.316
I'm the kind of person
who wants to take care of them.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.018
I'd even wash their hair.

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:16.355
I'd like to play
with the bubbles in their hair.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.458
I don't want to be passive in love.

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.727
Do you mind if I fall in love?

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.830
I'm sorry I poked my nose into this.

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:27.966
I'll show you such loving care,
no matter what.

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.568
Did you see the previews?

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:30.569
He's assertive.

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:34.373
You know this has got to be good.

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.842
Why did you decide to participate?

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.111
I wanted a boyfriend.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.114
Quite simply.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.183
I haven't had one for a year and a half.

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:48.253
I'm hoping this will give me
the opportunity to find someone nice.

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.625
What kind of person is your type?

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:56.528
Someone on the same wavelength.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.263
I know what you mean.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.832
Shun says, "I know what you mean."

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.935
In a soft whisper.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.002
And…

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.371
Well,

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:11.310
I like to be spoiled.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.379
I like feeling cherished.

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:17.583
What?

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:20.552
No one's reacting!

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:22.788
-I wanted something.
-We needed more of a response.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:27.526
I'm happy to have another cast member.

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.761
He's good-looking, isn't he?

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:33.498
He smiles a lot. Seems friendly.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.467
He's a positive person.

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:37.436
He seems mentally strong.

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:46.211
-Yeah, this shirt might be good.
-Huh?

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:47.479
This shirt might work.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:48.447
Looks good.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:54.753
It's cute.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.721
Do you like it?

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.989
Hey, Ryota.

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:58.056
Yes?

00:20:58.123 --> 00:20:59.925
If I ask for the usual…

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:01.994
Oh, a café mocha? I'll make one for you.

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:03.528
Would you?

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.197
Yes, of course.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.434
-Here.
-That's the most beautiful one yet.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.435
Thank you.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:16.742
The café mocha is an important factor
that connects them.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:17.909
That's true.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.978
I'll be there soon.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:23.849
What about Ikuo?

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.450
What if he likes you, Gensei?

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.819
That won't happen.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.689
It's unlikely.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:31.590
Why?

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:32.924
They're 12 years apart.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.360
Does that even matter?

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:40.098
What if he likes Kazuto?

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:41.833
Well…

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:46.638
But I feel like those two
aren't compatible.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.840
Kazuto and Ikuo.

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:50.275
I agree.

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:51.610
Different personalities.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.246
I don't know.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.814
I can't picture them together.

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:58.116
-That's important.
-Yeah.

00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:00.152
Yeah, that's very important.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:04.623
Shall we ask him who he likes best
based on first impressions?

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:06.858
-I think he'd tell us.
-Yeah, he would.

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.994
He'd say it with confidence.

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:10.629
"I like Shun."

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.334
What if he says it's Dai?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.270
You're saying it'll be a battle
between me and him?

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.105
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:21.740
You're right.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.277
It could be anyone.

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.645
It could be any one of us.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.083
It could be a battle.

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:34.786
-"A battle."
-"A battle."

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.023
-Ikuo has arrived.
-Yes, he has.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.859
-Yes, welcome.
-A new cast member.

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.894
He likes to be pampered, but he's bold.

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:46.264
He's a new type. We have the young guy,

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.301
but no one who'd boldly say,
"I like to be spoiled."

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:50.469
You're right.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:52.871
Who do you think he likes?
Well, we don't know yet.

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:53.872
Ikuo? Who…

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.341
-He said someone in tune with him.
-Yeah.

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:57.442
-Alan?
-Alan?

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.578
I thought it might be Alan too.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.313
-Someone mature.
-Right.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.115
I think Ikuo will go for Dai.

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:04.850
What? You think so?

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:05.951
Why?

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:09.421
They're on the same wavelength.
They're both excitable.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.323
-They're both extroverted.
-I see.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.925
Dai is the young guy,

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.394
but he loves being clingy.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.030
I feel like he'd totally welcome
someone being needy.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:21.333
Upcoming turmoil?

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.002
It smells good.

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:25.437
Oh wow!

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:28.039
It's my favorite dish!

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:29.775
It looks delicious!

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:30.942
So good!

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.744
Is the potato hard?

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:36.448
It's good.

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.349
It's okay?

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.251
The picnic will be special today.

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:40.886
It's gonna be so special.

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.521
Making rice balls?

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:43.855
-Let's do it together.
-Sure.

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.224
We're leaving.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:48.760
-Shun is worried.
-Yeah, he looks a bit concerned.

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.498
-We're the same age, right?
-Yeah.

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.967
You've been single a year and a half?

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.235
Yes, I have.

00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:58.370
How about you?

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.471
Two years. Exactly two.

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:00.539
We're about the same.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.740
Exactly two years.

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.408
It makes you want one.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.643
Yeah.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.347
Hey, have you ever made this
for a boyfriend?

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:11.149
No, I don't think I have.

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:15.053
But it'd be so nice.

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:17.456
Please put rice on top.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.125
Wait.

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:21.993
Go!

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:23.929
I'm not a dog.

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:24.863
I'm sorry.

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.531
Plastic wrap, please--

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:27.999
No need to get so mad!

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.167
-I know.
-That's right.

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:32.571
I've already had fun today.

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:35.240
-The picnic hasn't even started.
-You're not going?

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.445
When was the last time
you went on a picnic?

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.481
Three or four years ago.

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.648
For real?

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.684
Whoa, that's a lighthouse, right?

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.219
Yeah, I wanna go up there.

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.320
It's beautiful.

00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:49.888
Can you go inside it?

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:50.956
I'm sure you can.

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.625
Here we go.

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:55.193
Thank you for the food.

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.896
I'm gonna eat the fruit first.

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:01.132
Delicious.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.502
This is delicious.

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:05.904
Kazuto, this is really good.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.639
-Yeah. You're a genius.
-Good?

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:08.640
Yes, genius.

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:10.375
-Thanks for the food.
-So good.

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.544
-Do you like the potato salad?
-It's delicious.

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.579
It has crab meat in it. It's so posh.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:16.515
It's so good. Everyone should try it.

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:18.116
-I'm gonna try some.
-Yeah.

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:22.420
-Has anyone caught your interest?
-Yes.

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:28.193
I'd like to get to know him more
and talk to him more.

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.166
Oh, great.

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:36.101
Hit it back.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.504
It's peaceful.

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:40.772
-Nice.
-Too peaceful.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:43.508
It's hot.

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.744
-Let's find shade.
-Break time.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.746
-Let's take a break.
-Volleyball time!

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:49.147
You're a tough coach.

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:50.248
Let's play, then.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.922
-He's good.
-Yeah, he is.

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.323
Did he used to play?

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.158
He's the type who can do anything.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.494
He's athletic.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.362
-I find that…
-Yeah.

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:05.931
…endearing.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:11.570
You know what?

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:12.904
Yeah, what do you think?

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.807
I like this Mr. Ikuo.

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:22.747
But it could just be that he's new,
so it's refreshing.

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:27.085
Remember when you were making
sandwiches and rice balls today?

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:29.721
Ikuo was mostly next to you.

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.656
I think he likes you.

00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.658
I can't say I disagree.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.295
I like his vibe.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.464
Well…

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:41.633
He's straightforward.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.801
-What?
-Dai?

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:43.969
-Dai, dear?
-Oh, Dai.

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.937
Are you moving on to the next guy?

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:49.007
-Ikuo is totally different from Shun.
-That's right.

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:51.142
Wanna go take a pic up there?

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:52.310
-Huh?
-The rock.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:53.545
I want to.

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.080
-Let's go take photos.
-Sure.

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.749
Over by the rock? Or this way?

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.151
-Which one?
-Maybe this way first.

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:01.453
Yeah, sounds good.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.288
Hey, I'm back.

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:10.362
Did you have fun watching us?

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.864
Thank you.

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:13.999
Here you go, Ryota.

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.100
Thank you.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:18.536
-It's cute.
-Nice, right?

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:20.205
Did I gain "cute" points?

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.706
-One?
-One.

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.642
Is this the birth of a new couple?

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.517
Should we go to the lighthouse?

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.086
Tell us what you wanna do.

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.055
I want to talk with Kazuto.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.625
Ever since our date at the inn,

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.228
I have been unsure about how Kazuto felt.

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:46.464
I've been moving forward
without knowing how he feels.

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:50.402
That's been unsettling for me.

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.771
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.339
Where are we going?

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:55.507
To the lighthouse.

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:09.054
Their feelings are intertwined.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:18.930
I don't think Dai likes
what's happening over there.

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.699
It must be worrisome for you.

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.234
I'm not worried or anything.

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:26.337
I'm not worried at all.

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:29.274
I don't think Dai would choose him.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.544
I think he'll choose me,

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.746
but you know…

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.283
that's…

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:42.287
If I were you, I wouldn't like it.

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:43.254
Yeah, right?

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.830
How was the coffee truck
with Taeheon yesterday?

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.032
It was fun.

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:55.300
Did you enjoy it?

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:58.403
I see. I was really worried about it,
to tell you the truth,

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.674
when Taeheon raised his hand
and said he wanted to work with you.

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:09.013
I realized I want to know how you feel.

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:12.083
So I really wanted this time with you.

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:13.852
I see.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.492
Compared to how I felt
before the overnight date,

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:22.694
after the date,

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:26.931
I was genuinely interested in you
before the date.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.167
That's why

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:33.404
I wanted to go with you then,
so I wrote your name.

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:42.614
Now you're more like a friend to me.

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:45.784
That's how I feel now.

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:48.987
What a shock…

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:51.156
But he told him clearly.

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:52.357
-That's important.
-Yeah.

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.925
That makes you wanna cry.

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:00.899
Don't you wanna catch crabs?

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:02.600
Wow, I want crabs!

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:03.635
Can you come here?

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:06.271
-Seriously? I'm really gonna come.
-Yeah, come here.

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.306
All right.

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.076
-Will the crabs pinch?
-See? Look.

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:15.013
Can crabs live underwater?

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:16.681
-There are so many!
-It's crazy.

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.287
Hey, be careful. You'll get wet.

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:24.289
Without a doubt.

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:27.058
Come to think of it,

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.595
I'm not very assertive.

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:32.564
So it's likely…

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:38.269
that a person like Ikuo
is a better match for Dai.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.506
I don't know.

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.210
What was your ex like?

00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:47.645
Out of all of us here,

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.248
you're the most similar.

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:52.584
I'm similar?

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.818
Your vibe.

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:56.354
He was tall too.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.057
Your face is similar too.

00:30:59.123 --> 00:30:59.958
For real?

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.628
What was your last relationship like?

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.430
I was with someone way older.

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:07.365
That one spoiled me a lot.

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:11.870
-Your ex was sweet on you?
-Super sweet.

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.171
Ask me how sweet.

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:14.606
How sweet?

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:17.442
-Like frosting on a strawberry shortcake--
-Annoying!

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:19.277
Hey, let me finish my joke!

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:22.914
-I felt like it was gonna be long.
-Don't say that.

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:24.582
-So I stopped you.
-Yeah?

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.618
We're so in sync, aren't we?

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:29.053
-Yeah, I think so.
-Isn't it insane? We're so alike.

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:32.323
-It's insane.
-I love being in tune with someone.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.094
No matter how much I entertain someone,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.796
if I get lackluster responses,

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:40.431
it's a turnoff.

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:42.533
Yeah.

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:48.239
I wonder what Dai thinks.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:51.876
Just because they hit it off
doesn't mean it's love.

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.045
Yes, it's a tough one.

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:56.447
-They could be BFFs.
-Right.

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:58.683
-Having fun is not enough.
-Right.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.053
Actually, Dai has already fallen for Shun
with his darker personality.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.788
Though they're totally different.

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:05.356
Watch the gravel.

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:06.257
Yeah.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:11.763
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:13.965
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:15.500
-That must've hurt.
-It did.

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.468
Let's head to the grass.

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:18.503
It must hurt.

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:19.570
It really hurts.

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.974
-Is it really painful?
-It's really painful.

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:25.643
Did you hurt your ankle?
Hey, wait. Take it easy.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.544
It hurts.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:28.746
Are you okay?

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:30.481
Yeah, I'm fine. It isn't bleeding.

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.083
Are you okay? Does it still hurt?

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.885
It's probably fine.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:34.786
Are you sure?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.021
-Okay.
-Can you walk?

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:38.756
It must hurt.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:41.192
Oh, it hurts.

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.761
Can I give you a piggyback ride?
Should be easy.

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:44.929
Hold my bottle.

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:48.700
Yeah, I got this.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:51.002
Wait a minute.

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:53.304
You're going that way?

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.039
Wait, which way, then?

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:55.974
That way.

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.744
Aw, Dad!

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.678
Knock it off.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.680
I'm not your dad.

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.483
This part is steep.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.617
I'm fine.

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:08.386
-To the observatory?
-Is it too hard?

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:10.388
No problem. Let's go.

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.257
Wow. It's so beautiful.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:16.627
Thank you for today.

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:18.463
That's my line.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:23.935
You clearly told me, "No, we're friends."

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.604
That was important for me.

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:30.975
I didn't know how you felt about me,

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:36.347
but my feelings
took on a life of their own.

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:44.122
Now I feel like I'll be able
to enjoy my time with you more naturally.

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:49.994
So I feel grateful that you chose
to be honest and say how you feel.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.699
Wow, he's so positive. It's impressive.

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.067
He's quite mature.

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:58.536
He articulates his feelings
with consideration.

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.772
-What about you, Ryo?
-Huh?

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:02.940
Don't you want to talk to someone?

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.108
I do, but

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:05.943
I can't go.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.879
Three of us there would be awkward.

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.013
I see.

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.582
I won't be able to say what I want to say.

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:13.885
I'll find another opportunity.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.120
I want to talk to Kazuto.

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:22.060
I'm interested in Kazuto.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.729
Oh, poor Gensei…

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:25.763
Gensei.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.698
-That must be hard.
-Painful.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:30.668
Maybe tomorrow or the day after.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.969
Or today, right?

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:32.870
Yeah.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.006
Welcome back.

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:37.675
I'm back. I'm having a banana.

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:38.643
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.578
Do you guys want a drink?

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:43.281
-We had some water.
-Did you?

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.882
-He looked.
-He glanced at him.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:45.917
He wanted to check.

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:48.686
Things are complicated.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.123
I'm gonna drink some water.

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.808
Are you okay, Shun?

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.577
I'm annoyed by him.

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:15.012
-Annoyed?
-Yeah.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:17.014
I don't even want to hear his voice.

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.784
I'm having an adverse reaction to him.

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.896
Wait. Run around once more.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:40.505
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't be able to handle this.

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:43.007
That's what Gensei's thinking.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.075
Right.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.411
I wonder what the heck this is.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.181
It's not jealousy or anything.

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:59.590
What kind of picnic is this?
This is a first.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.374
What a turbulent picnic.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.009
Truly!

00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:19.343
Only Ikuo enjoyed it.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.412
Ikuo knows nothing!

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.181
Ikuo is innocent!
