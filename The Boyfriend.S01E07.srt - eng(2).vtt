WEBVTT

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.544
That looks so delicious.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.013
-Did you make it?
-Yup.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.180
-Looks good!
-Cool.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.548
Thank you!

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.551
-You should blow on it.
-Thanks.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:19.953
Kazuto, look this way for one sec.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.688
Kazuto, look this way.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.157
Wow.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.693
-You made this by yourself?
-Yes.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.062
No one helped with the seasoning?

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.630
-I seasoned it myself.
-Amazing.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.865
Hey, the chopsticks…

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.766
So delicious.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:36.970
The chopstick rests?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:38.938
Nikujaga.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.574
Hey, this soup. What is it for?

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.842
That's tonjiru pork soup.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.079
But today's main dishes are
meat and potato stew and sashimi.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.048
The tonjiru is…

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.051
Did Ikuo make this nikujaga?

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.419
-Yep.
-It's so tasty.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.059
ARTIST

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.495
Did you guys have a fun picnic?

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.897
-I had a good time.
-Yeah?

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.031
Did you have fun?

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.703
How about you?

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.638
Yep.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:25.885
Thank you.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.120
That's called "lazy."

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.688
-This is called "lazy"?
-Yeah.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.723
Thank you. This is called "being kind."

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.092
Thank you.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.361
-How awkward.
-So many emotions.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.363
-It's awkward.
-It was like being in hell.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.565
This is bad.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.502
Let's put the bento lunch leftovers
in the fridge.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.870
I'll wash the bento box.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.373
You get soaked doing this.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.845
JAPANESE FOOD CHEF

00:02:58.912 --> 00:02:59.913
Oh, this is…

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:06.753
Yum.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.991
Can we talk?

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.026
Why?

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:13.993
I want to talk.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.894
Okay.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:16.763
What is it?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:25.872
I really feel like I left you alone today.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.615
-I don't think you really do.
-I do.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.651
In the end, you're just talk.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.553
What do you mean?

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.023
You said you left me alone there…

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.964
but your words and actions don't match.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:53.866
It made me think

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.203
that you were a person

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.406
who doesn't walk the walk.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.774
Yeah.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.878
So I feel like I'm done.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.252
There's something I want to say.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.186
No.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.858
You can say…

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.595
whatever you want.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.165
So make me understand

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.535
some other way.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.004
That's it.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.383
It was good to talk to him.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:46.419
Well,

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:53.693
I think Shun finally started to want me.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.829
It's no time to be celebrating,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:02.001
and there were definitely
many things I liked about Ikuo.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:03.836
But in the end,

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.973
after everything that happened,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.476
seeing Shun feeling a little lonely,

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:15.648
or seeing him out of sorts,
unable to express his feelings…

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.552
I can't help but think, "Aw, cute."

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.087
I mean, I'm attracted to him.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.956
I think he's good-looking and cute,
and I like him.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.226
I like--
I think I've fallen for him already.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.798
He finds him endearing.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:36.969
Dai now seems so mature.
His views of Shun are so understanding.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.372
In fact, he's happy
he has Shun's attention.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.607
He can't leave him alone anymore, can he?

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.845
You're going to drink one now?

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.747
I'm making this for Kazuto.

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.415
What?

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:54.887
A café mocha?

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:55.788
Yeah.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.560
I thought that was a Gensei exclusive.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.829
Oh, that's painful!

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:03.763
That hurts.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.770
I don't know what to say…

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:15.375
Well, it was the first time
I fully understood Ryota's feelings.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.945
I felt that he cared for Kazuto very much.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.314
I can't really see a future.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.319
I think maybe my role here is done.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.354
I feel like I've done all I can.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.658
The special café mocha…

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.194
It was exclusive to Gensei…

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.696
How heartbreaking.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.765
What will Gensei do?

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.800
I want him to do Ryota's makeup.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.769
Yeah, he hasn't done that yet, right?

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.004
I really want him to do that.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.775
As he does his makeup
and stands behind him to do his hair,

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.077
a tear falls,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:53.212
but Ryota doesn't notice
since Gensei is behind him.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.515
You already see it happening?

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:00.920
-It dinged.
-There it is.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.490
-"The coffee truck will be closed today."
-Okay.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.359
Now what?

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.729
"You will now head to a racetrack

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.697
for a go-kart contest."

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.832
Craziness!

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.103
-Sounds fun.
-Awesome!

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.907
"The winner will be able
to ask one person…"

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:22.642
What?

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.578
"…to fulfill their wish."

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:26.946
A wish?

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.081
That's interesting.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.786
-Did you hear that?
-What?

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.421
The wish is important.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.292
I'm not looking for a date
with anyone else besides Shun.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.028
So, Shun.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.731
I want to talk to Ryota.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:53.206
I'll tell Kazuto
I want to go on a date with him.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.045
Well, the person I thought of was Kazuto.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.181
Rather than doing something with him,

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.517
I just want to know why I thought of him.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.857
I want to try again with Kazuto,
just the two of us.

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.291
The coffee truck is fine too.

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:15.428
I want to do something
with just the two of us.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.098
What's Kazuto thinking?

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.505
I don't know what to wish.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:31.310
Maybe make breakfast with Ryota.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.545
But I don't know.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:39.085
I want more alone time with him,

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.686
and I want to go on a date.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:44.857
I'm not sure.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:47.960
I don't know.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.368
-This is insane.
-Wow! That looks fun!

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:56.669
I want to do it too!

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.604
-It's a proper circuit.
-I want to go.

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.306
Look at our names on that screen.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.608
The top two will be in the finals, right?

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.611
Kazuto, third place means nothing.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.780
Go for it!

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.428
-Did it start?
-It did.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.430
It started! Taeheon!

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:27.366
Taeheon is so fast!

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.135
-Good start.
-Good start, Taeheon!

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.469
Looks so fun!

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:34.740
THIRD: KAZUTO

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:35.641
This is crazy!

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.978
-Isn't Ikuo good?
-Ikuo is good.

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.146
So fast!

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:41.414
He's kind of cool.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.715
FIRST: IKUO

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:43.883
What the heck?

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.985
-So fast.
-Incredible.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.120
-Shun is second.
-Here he comes!

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.822
It's Shun.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.624
-Let's go, Shun!
-Go!

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.959
Pass Ikuo.

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:54.527
FIRST: IKUO

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:59.599
He's good at everything.

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:00.633
It's fun to watch.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.567
SECOND: SHUN

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.768
Here comes Shun!

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:05.237
-Yeah, Shun!
-Yeah!

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.176
You guys were cool!

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.712
Who do you think will win?

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.213
My bet is on Mr. Alan.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.781
No, I think Dai.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.116
I bet Gensei.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.158
My legs don't reach.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.493
His legs won't reach.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.662
How cute!

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.064
Good luck.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.433
-Alan.
-Alan is slow.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.468
Hang in there!

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.206
He fell way behind.

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:41.641
Is the brake on?

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:44.110
Wait, he passed him!

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.211
It's Dai.

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:46.946
FIRST: DAI

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.915
THIRD: GENSEI

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.117
It's Ryota.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.053
Ryota!

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.723
-A tight race!
-Hey!

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.691
Great.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.593
Dai's angry. He got angry.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.028
Be careful.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.663
This is a great race.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.237
He's going for it.

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:12.705
He's not giving up.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.540
Ryota's unusually aggressive.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.208
-Yeah.
-Incredible.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.143
FIRST: RYOTA

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.177
He came from behind.

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:20.246
SECOND: DAI

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.016
Why did you pass me?

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:25.918
-Who's first?
-I wanted to win.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.720
-What's your wish?
-I want to know.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.522
-Me too.
-I want to go on a date.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.657
I want to go on a date too.

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:33.492
Of course I wanna go on a date.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.295
-Shun.
-Why won't he take off the helmet?

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.997
-Good luck!
-Why?

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.865
He's so comical.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.102
Let's go, Ikuo!

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:53.946
Wow, here we go!

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:57.983
What happened to Shun?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.218
Hang in there.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.519
Shun, go for it!

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:01.587
Unlock the brake.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:02.655
Hey, go for it.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:04.590
Is Ikuo in the lead?

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.658
-That's Ikuo.
-Ikuo.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.127
Ikuo is unrivaled.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.399
-Ikuo spun out.
-Ikuo.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.301
-He was too aggressive.
-Go!

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:18.471
All at once!

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:19.705
-Dai is first.
-It's Dai.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.373
-Dai.
-Dai's in first now.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.374
Hang in there, Ikuo.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.543
-Ikuo is in second?
-It's Shun.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.312
-Shun!
-Shun is amazing!

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.247
Shun is cool.

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:29.849
-What happened?
-Shun and Dai!

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.883
Dai and Shun.

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.586
Wow, amazing!

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.955
-What? Shun?
-Shun is the biggest surprise!

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.490
He woke up.

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:39.792
-It's only the first lap.
-What? Crazy.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.394
Insane!

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.196
It's Shun.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:45.431
Shun is good.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:52.037
FIRST: SHUN

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.706
WINNER: SHUN

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.107
That's it. He won.

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:58.110
-You're too fast, Shun.
-Shun, you're great!

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.347
Shun showed his determination.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:02.581
-That's right.
-Yeah.

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:04.950
He wanted to win. He wants his wish.

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:06.318
What do you want to do?

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.219
Yeah.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.821
Look at his arrogant face!

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.189
He looks pretty pleased.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.191
Wow, that was one minute and ten seconds.

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.592
Unexpected.

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:14.994
-Good job.
-Great.

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.629
So tell us.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:17.863
Tell us.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.565
-Say what?
-Your wish.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.766
Wait a minute.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.134
My wish?

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:29.975
What?

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:34.713
None.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.422
You don't have a wish?

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.898
What? Wait.

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.033
He's funny.

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.501
Shenron has appeared.

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.469
But you have no wish?

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:01.774
-I guess Shun is interesting.
-He's funny.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.143
I guess that's part of his charm.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.078
-That's his charm.
-Yeah.

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.848
I'm kind of envious that he can say that.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:09.815
That's true.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.852
People tend to try
to come up with something.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.587
Even when we don't have a wish.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:15.855
I'm sure Dai understands.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:20.292
Right, like,
"Yes, you're being your usual self."

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.195
We just watched them have fun
in the go-kart race, that's all.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.297
-Right.
-Exactly.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.132
Thanks for the food.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.200
Thanks for the food.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:29.134
Delish.

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:33.606
I'm so happy.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:36.542
Hey, Ikuo.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.912
What was your impression
of the person you're interested in?

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:41.480
-The first impression?
-Yeah.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.482
My impression is…

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:48.687
Well, I haven't had the chance
to gauge any feelings yet.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:54.059
I do want to find out more
through future conversations.

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:58.230
I don't want… to be passive in love.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.101
Happiness won't come if you just wait.

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:06.438
I can't be in a relationship with someone
unless there are feelings there.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.041
So, I wondered,

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.077
why not just make them fall for me?

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:14.847
The other person.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:19.084
I think it's good to keep trying

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:22.821
until the person becomes interested.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.661
Everyone's bound to project
their own romances onto what he said.

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.362
Yeah, gets you thinking.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.931
I'm getting heated.

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.838
It's urgent. I want the two of us to talk.

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.907
Who said that to whom?

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.042
Whose voice was that?

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.971
Ikuocchi.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:15.774
Whoa, Kazuto is remarkable!

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:18.410
-Kazuto is incredible!
-Amazing!

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.779
-How many is this now? Four? Five?
-Five?

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:21.847
He got five!

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.615
-Including Usak.
-Yes.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:27.653
I feel like I want to spend
a little more alone time with him,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.024
so I want to go on a date with Kazuto.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:40.332
Well, I wanted to have
a proper conversation.

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.637
Ever since I met you at the coffee truck,

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.674
I've been very attracted to you.

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.842
Is that so?

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.810
Yes, secretly.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:57.683
Then yesterday, remember when
we were alone in the kitchen for a moment?

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.819
I was panicking inside.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.154
Panicking?

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.756
My heart was racing.

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:09.661
I really think it was love at first sight.

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.264
I see.

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.675
Can I just…

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:26.779
follow my heart?

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.048
Kazuto…

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.721
do you mind if I fall in love?

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.278
That's a question, right?

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:10.222
I think you've just seen
the superficial parts of me,

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:14.726
and you feel you want to get to know me.

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.896
If we spend more time together,

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:22.101
and you still think you like me,
I'd be very happy.

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:28.273
But I don't know you at all yet.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:32.678
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't really trying.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:38.650
I just thought, "Oh, a young guy
with a lot of energy is here."

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.123
I actually didn't think
I'd really get along with you.

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:49.728
But… talking with you like this

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.364
makes me think I should get to know you.

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:54.733
Thank you.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.908
What a surprise.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.382
I confessed my feelings.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:16.822
I felt that it opened the door
for him to get to know me.

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:19.992
I hope it'll lead to the next step.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.898
I'm surprised and, of course, flattered.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:32.838
To fall in love
based solely on superficial qualities is…

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.741
I'm like, "What do you know about me?"

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:39.077
"I don't know you either."
I can't help but think that.

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.413
Yeah.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.984
You can't judge a person after only
meeting them for two or three days.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:51.990
"Do you mind if I fall in love with you?"
Isn't that a tough question?

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:53.792
I wouldn't know how to respond.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.763
Saying, "I'm sorry, but I have
a crush on you," would be better.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.264
It's an unfair question.

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.766
-Yeah, I agree.
-Right.

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.100
It's hard, right?

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.003
-You're passing on the responsibility.
-Right.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.373
It's hard to believe it's the same guy
running around with a cloth.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.776
He's a totally different person.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:12.177
You're so right.

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.115
This blue will look good.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.051
Try it on.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.355
Looks great! Don't you think?

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.824
-Yeah.
-The reaction…

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:26.858
Cute.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:27.826
You look great.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:30.395
You don't often wear colorful clothes.

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.397
-Wear it.
-You should wear it.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:33.765
-Looks great.
-Thank you.

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:35.167
Ryota has work today.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.535
He went to work.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:39.137
He has a makeup shoot.

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.172
-I see.
-Yeah.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.708
-Wow. That's right. He's a model.
-Yeah.

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.376
You're wearing eye makeup today.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.712
Wow, great observation!

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:48.981
Impressive! That's why you're a pro!

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.649
Tell me the product number later.

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:51.650
Sure.

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:53.619
He's not asking you! Not you!

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.589
It dinged.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.591
"Today's shift will be announced."

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:01.126
There's a shift today?

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:04.630
"Ikuo will take the shift today."

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.199
My turn. Yes.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.270
"Please indicate
if you'd like to work with Ikuo."

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.138
Raise our hands?

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:17.743
"If there are several candidates,
Ikuo can choose up to two."

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:18.944
Huh? Two?

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.346
-Two.
-So three of us can work?

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:23.415
Ready?

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.251
Who wants to work with me today?

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.138
We've never had three before.

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:47.539
Yeah, the first time ever.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.975
-A three-person shift.
-Yeah. It's the first time.

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:53.712
It'll definitely be fun.

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.740
"Up to two" means
you don't have to pick two.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:38.657
That's all.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.296
-He chose you, Kazuto.
-I've been chosen.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.631
Another day without you.

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:59.945
Is cooking your favorite household chore?

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:01.980
I guess so.

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:05.584
-I don't want to cook if it's just for me.
-Yes.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.887
If it's for others, I don't mind at all.

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:11.656
I mean, I want to do it for other people

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:13.925
because I don't like doing it myself.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.128
How about you?

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.629
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.731
I like taking care of people.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:23.602
I'd do the laundry and other chores.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.238
I would have meals ready.

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:27.806
You're sweet.

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.741
You're quite the devoted partner.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.810
I tend to devote myself.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.179
Maybe we're a little alike.

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.519
Hi. Would you like some delicious coffee?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.387
This is good.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.656
Is it good? Thank you very much.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:45.957
We also have guava juice.

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:47.692
Do you want to try a little?

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:48.727
Should we try it?

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.163
He's cute.

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:52.597
Thank you.

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:53.865
Is he around two?

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.033
A year and one month.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.635
A year and a month? Too cute.

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.770
-Come here.
-His name is Kento.

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:00.205
-Kento.
-So cute.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.973
He's so friendly.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.508
He likes good-looking guys.

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:09.581
Kazuto works at the coffee truck a lot.

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:10.482
Yeah.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.684
Why didn't you raise your hand?

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:13.585
Me?

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.421
I felt it wasn't right to work with him.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:18.924
Why?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.459
I really just thought

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.762
today was not the day for Mr. Ikuo.

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:28.467
You're just talk.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:29.768
Make me understand

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:32.204
some other way.

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:42.047
-The corners of his mouth are turning up.
-He's happy.

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.049
What the heck?

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:46.117
What's with these two?

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:47.285
I don't know.

00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:50.188
Alan, what made you raise your hand?

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.122
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.124
I raised it because Kazuto did.

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.061
That was why?

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.229
You wanted to go too?

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:02.133
So what's going on with you and Kazuto?

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:06.104
I'm simply being true to myself.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:09.875
I haven't worked with him at the truck,
and I really want to talk with him.

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:11.843
He's a very nice guy.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.379
He's kind to everyone.
I like that kind of person.

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:16.948
Hello.

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.184
Okay, let's finish up.

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:20.652
Okay.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.821
Let's finish up.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:25.524
We're closed.

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:32.330
Read it to me.

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.499
-Just read it?
-Read it out loud.

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.101
-Read it out loud?
-Yes.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.403
"Dear Ikuo."

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.304
Yes.

00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:41.573
It's like a letter.

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:45.877
"I had the impression
that you were always hyper,

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:50.181
but you were calm today,
and my perception of you has changed."

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:53.184
"It was fun talking and working with you."

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.053
"Let's work together again."

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:56.521
"From Kazuto."

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:04.763
How was your first time
working at the coffee truck today?

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:08.633
It meant I saw the cool side of you.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.337
It was different when
we were all together, just having fun.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.738
When we're working,

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:17.442
we reveal our true nature,
especially when we're busy.

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:18.376
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:20.679
Like how well we can support others

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:22.914
or how considerate we can be.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.951
That stuff becomes important.

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.921
I felt supported by you today.

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:33.191
I wasn't supporting you at all.

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:34.726
Seriously?

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:37.829
What?

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:42.233
That's pretty.
Like a slow version of a shooting star.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.702
A show version?

00:26:49.908 --> 00:26:50.842
How about this?

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.446
-I can give you a head massage.
-Massage me.

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:57.415
Dai's head massage?

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:00.685
Too soft.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.787
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:06.958
That feels good.

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:07.892
Right?

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:11.730
He told me to walk the walk.

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:15.300
I'm using physical contact
to show that I want him.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.738
If that happens more often, he'll realize.

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:24.009
I'm trying to bring our relationship back
to the way it was before.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.612
I'm feeling more and more

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:31.249
like I want to spend time with him.

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:35.553
I want to go on a date with him again.

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.990
If we take more time,

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:43.428
I think we may be able
to build a good relationship.

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:49.167
Oh, Shun started acting sweet.

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:52.103
He hasn't said anything
about what might make Dai happy.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.204
Not at all.

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:56.841
Dai has changed himself so much…

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:58.910
-Yeah.
-…that he's starting to lose himself.

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:03.548
I think it's fine to accommodate
to a point where you're comfortable.

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:06.384
It's important to compromise,

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:09.421
but if you have to change
to where you're no longer you,

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.989
then someday…

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:14.059
But trying to adapt to the person you like

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.960
is something that happens in love.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:16.861
Yes.

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.197
Some people derive happiness from that.

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.032
-That's true.
-Yes.

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:23.735
Ikuo changed too.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:26.237
-He suddenly toned himself down.
-Exactly.

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:28.506
Kazuto wrote, "Let's work together again."

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:33.211
-But the word "again" is almost criminal.
-It is a crime.

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:34.979
If you say it when you don't mean it,

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:38.283
you're giving them false hope,
like, "They wanna see me again."

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:40.785
As adults, we often say,
"Let's do this again."

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.554
"Let's go for a drink again."

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.556
-Just social etiquette.
-It happens.

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:49.327
But from Ikuo's side,
he may have expectations.

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:51.262
"Good morning."

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:52.764
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:29:00.371
"Kazuto will take the shift today."

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.841
-Am I the poster boy?
-Again.

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:07.378
"Please indicate if you would like
to work with Kazuto."

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:11.783
"If there are two or more candidates,
Kazuto can choose up to two."

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:15.687
-Have you made up your mind?
-Are you guys okay?

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.821
Are you ready?

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:20.091
There will be many raised hands.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.495
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.163
Here we go.

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:27.098
What?

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.267
Everyone.

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:30.735
That's crazy.

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:32.337
Everyone?

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.773
Who will he choose?

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.574
Unbelievable.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.309
-Yeah.
-Let's all go.

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:41.813
What am I gonna do?

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.449
Three or two.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.584
Right?

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:49.354
Okay, I've decided.

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:11.676
Alan.

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.161
Gensei.

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.532
-Please work with me.
-I'd love to.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.000
I'd love to.

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:39.537
Let's have fun.

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:41.806
The three of you. It's gonna be fun.

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.575
-Let's have fun.
-Sounds good.

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:48.913
I was so frustrated.

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:54.319
I was like, "Why didn't he choose me?"

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.022
I want

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.992
to spend more time with him.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.596
It's frustrating.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:08.466
I'm about to cry.

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:10.835
Yeah.

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:16.207
I feel so bad. He's so devoted.

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.109
He missed a precious opportunity.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.151
Yay, let's do our best.

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.519
And have a lot of fun.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.623
-We're open.
-Okay, we're open.

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:32.724
We're open.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.691
Thank you.

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.664
Thank you for waiting.
Do you need any sugar?

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.366
-No, I'm fine.
-You're okay?

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:43.501
-Thank you. Take care.
-Thank you.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.905
So cute.

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.276
Hi, Yuzu.

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:54.178
-How much did you say it was for one?
-It's 250 yen each.

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:56.381
-I'll take eight.
-Eight? Thank you.

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.816
Will you bag four of them separately?

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:00.151
Oh, I got it.

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:01.386
-Okay?
-Thank you.

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.755
You like Kazuto, right?

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:07.992
Come on. No need to say it outright.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.427
What do you like about him?

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.696
I've heard if you can list ten things,

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.831
then that's a good sign.

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:14.732
Ten…

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:19.671
He was kind and attentive
when I first arrived.

00:32:19.737 --> 00:32:23.107
It felt like he was watching over everyone
like a leader.

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:24.275
I found that attractive.

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:29.113
And when I talked to him,
he had a clear vision for the future.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.682
He's strong-willed.

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:33.184
I respect him for that.

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:35.019
I get nervous when I'm alone with him.

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:36.854
I do.

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:38.990
I can't talk. I lose my groove.

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:42.593
It's so hard on me that he's not here now.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.828
Why not contact him?

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.363
Yeah, message him.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.531
-He shouldn't.
-No.

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:47.598
No, he shouldn't.

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.367
What an idea!

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.403
There's always someone who says,
"Just message them."

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.538
-Right.
-There is.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.620
ARE YOU HAVING FUN
WITH THE THREE-PERSON SHIFT?

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:11.856
-Ryota sent a message again.
-Oh no.

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:18.997
It's so beautiful.

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:23.101
Thanks again for choosing me today.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.002
Thank you.

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.636
Was it difficult to choose?

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:28.439
I thought you'd only choose Alan.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.641
Why did you raise your hand today?

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:33.177
Well, I had wanted to work with Kazuto.

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:34.579
You haven't worked together?

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.546
We haven't.

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:38.750
I don't know how many more times
we can work together.

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.752
It may be the last time.

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.121
So I thought I'd go.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.857
I had a feeling there'd be three.

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:49.327
I was sure you would choose one more.

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:50.828
Did you know?

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:53.431
Yeah. You're easy to read.

00:33:53.998 --> 00:33:56.701
I hadn't worked with you or Gensei.

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:57.935
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.607
You chose me
because you'd never worked with me?

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:04.275
Yeah.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.684
Did he want Gensei there
to alleviate any tension?

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.853
-He didn't want to be trapped.
-Yeah.

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:20.058
Tomorrow, why don't we have dinner early

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.760
and drink the night away?

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:23.828
Drink the night away?

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.196
I don't know about everyone else,

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:27.565
but there are things
we can only say at night.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:31.335
Great. It's nice
to have a drink sometimes.

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.671
Do you have time now?

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.510
-They're getting along now?
-What are they doing?

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.879
Applying oil or something?

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:43.014
-A massage?
-Lotion?

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:43.948
Are you sure?

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:48.753
Yeah, here.

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.998
Look at you. Great job.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:01.966
What?

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:04.569
Good night.

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.237
They're lovey-dovey.

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:07.772
They're back together.

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.974
Kazuto didn't notice the hug at all.

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.843
That's true. He must be exhausted.

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:13.144
He's tired.

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:14.846
They're hugging so passionately.

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:18.116
He must be worn out
if he didn't notice that.

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.225
So, about staying up late tonight.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.993
What's the plan?

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.629
Are we gonna have dinner first?

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.530
Yeah.

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:36.100
After we clean up, once we're all…

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.902
Like a pajama party.

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:41.372
The whole "showing our true selves"
sort of bothers me.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:48.479
Some people are more relaxed and can be
themselves when they drink alcohol.

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:54.285
But I think everyone has
different ways of showing themselves.

00:35:55.086 --> 00:36:00.558
For me, I like being in a more sober state
when expressing myself

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:02.527
and seeing others express themselves.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:05.196
Everyone has different motivations…

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.197
You know,

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:11.002
I can usually show my true self
at the dinner table.

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:13.971
If we spent more time at dinner,

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.574
I'd be very comfortable.

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:20.077
I want to enjoy my meal during mealtime.

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:24.882
I also don't like to do many chores
before I go to bed.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.370
The conversation surrounding me
was going nowhere.

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.408
I went into a negative space…

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.016
"Good morning."

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:02.086
-Good morning.
-"Today's shift will be announced."

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:05.022
"Dai will be taking the shift today."

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.923
Yes.

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:17.201
"Please indicate
if you'd like to work with Dai."

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:24.308
"If there are two or more candidates,
Dai can choose up to two."

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.478
Are you ready?

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.420
If you want to work with me,
raise your hand.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.197
Thank you.

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:51.802
Is this okay?

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.703
Yeah.

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.605
It's become a hassle.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:56.907
It's a hassle.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.176
-Shun-chan.
-Come on.

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:01.712
You don't have much time left.

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:14.992
Please work with me.

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:18.996
Ikuo is cute. He has a big smile.

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.097
I'll do my best.

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.803
I almost raised my fist.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.473
I don't think
I have any reason to apologize.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.775
I was shocked.

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:39.283
-What?
-What happened?

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.319
Stop with the sneak peeks!

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.587
Dai doesn't normally say he's shocked.

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:46.023
It has always been the other way around.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.225
He clearly expressed his feelings.

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.328
He said he almost raised his fist.
