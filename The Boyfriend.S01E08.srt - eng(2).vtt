WEBVTT

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:10.777
You're okay?

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.678
Yeah.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.613
It's become a hassle.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.949
It's a hassle.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.090
RESTAURANT WORKER

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.026
Please work with me.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.030
Ikuo is cute. He has a big smile.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.264
I'll do my best.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.241
When I looked to the side,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.510
one of them didn't have their hand raised.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.079
I almost raised my fist.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.848
Will you talk to him when you get back?

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.951
I think he'll come talk to me.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.455
He feels secure in your relationship.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.456
Yeah, he does.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.959
But it's not my style
to make him feel insecure.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:03.396
-You want him to feel secure.
-Exactly, feeling secure is…

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.198
But you aren't a couple yet.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.099
No, we aren't.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.468
Then is it even necessary?

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.103
Well,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.810
if I feel he's taking
my feelings too lightly,

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.345
or if he starts acting spoiled,

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:23.817
then I'll be like,
"Don't take this for granted."

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.156
What should I do?

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.293
What's done is done.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.697
-Are you worried?
-I'm worried.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.599
Why didn't you raise your hand?

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.735
Well, I thought it was already decided--

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.471
-Were you overwhelmed?
-Yeah.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.373
Well, I can understand that.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.478
I didn't feel like working the truck.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.583
Well, I think…

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.089
it's going to keep happening.
Me getting in a bad mood.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.091
Even if one issue is resolved,

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.162
others will pop up,
and I'll be in a bad mood again.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.266
I'm troublesome.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.437
I think I'm a troublesome person.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.073
So he knows himself.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.108
He needs attention.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.847
What I like most about Shun

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:39.352
is that he doesn't try
to just smooth things over,

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:44.224
and he's too honest
and says what he thinks.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.328
In some ways, that makes him trustworthy.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.464
What about how he didn't raise his hand?

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.934
I don't know why he didn't,

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.104
but I want him to explain it to me
in his own words.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.274
He did message me, at least.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.342
What did he say?

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.876
Well…

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.747
"I was tired after that debate
and didn't feel like going to work."

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.682
"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings."

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.418
"I wanted to go with you,
but I just couldn't."

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.854
I wouldn't forgive him
if it was just this,

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:19.392
but one hour later, he sent me
a random picture of a frog.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.863
When he does things like that,
I can't help but find him adorable.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.901
-He found them.
-Cute.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.205
I need to really think about things too.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.708
It'd be better if he just said,
"Sorry, I can't see you like that."

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.776
You mean Kazuto?

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.544
I want him to just spit it out.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:42.315
-Why don't you make him say it?
-Maybe I will.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.418
Like, "What do you really think about me?"
Then I can let it go.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.253
What are you gonna do after?

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.257
I'll try to think things through.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.894
-You'll take the photo?
-Yeah.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.929
-Ready?
-Okay.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.864
Here we go.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:00.833
How is it?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.734
It's crazy!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.803
Let me see!

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.638
Please.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.407
Super cute!

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.543
Incredible.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.712
-I'll think about it.
-About what?

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.281
Other ways to take cute photos.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.850
Oh yeah. I'll think of ideas too.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.952
-We can think about it together.
-Right.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.022
They're having fun.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.624
They're good friends.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.726
-We're back.
-We've come back.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:27.994
Oh, welcome back!

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.629
We're back.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.697
How was your day?

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.532
-It was fun.
-Yes, it was fun.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.967
-You guys are cute.
-Thanks.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.575
And so…

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:43.476
Hey, Dai.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.346
Can you come to the first floor?

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:47.413
-Right now?
-Yeah.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.348
Sure.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.118
-I'm here.
-Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.054
Are you upset about today?

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.123
Not upset.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.325
But I was just shocked.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:05.531
It may sound like an excuse,
but can I explain?

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:06.432
Sure.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.770
Before the shift was announced,

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.606
some stuff happened.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.509
It felt like a hassle,

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.947
and I was mentally exhausted.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:26.619
I messaged you the reason already, but…

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:32.291
You said something like, "I wanted
to work with you, but I just couldn't."

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.595
Your choice of words felt like
you were pushing me away.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:41.134
There might've been a better way
for you to deal with this.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.102
That's how I feel.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.982
Do you have more to say?

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:56.916
No.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.794
-Once again.
-That's not good.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.228
Come on, Shun.

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:12.298
-Things don't always go the way you want.
-They don't.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.800
Yeah, that's it.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.036
What Dai said in the end wasn't wrong.

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.472
He's feeling down.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:29.382
What's up?

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.587
Something happened?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.825
You look quite sad.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.229
FROM KOREA, DESIGNER

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.697
I talked with him.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.238
Things got even worse.

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.273
Really?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.276
It's because

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.681
I haven't apologized.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.518
I don't think I have…

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.356
any reason to apologize.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.262
Well, I hurt his feelings.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.599
I feel bad about that.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.837
But I'm not obligated to volunteer.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:25.905
That's true.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:26.906
Yeah.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.576
I'm getting confused.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.514
What you're saying is true.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.682
Raising your hand or not is up to you.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.317
We're not officially dating yet.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.853
I like him, but I'm not head over heels.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.625
Even if you were,
you still don't have to raise your hand.

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.326
But, you know,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.596
you said you felt bad, right?

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.864
I did, yeah.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.966
In that case…

00:08:55.167 --> 00:09:01.240
it's true you have a choice,
but you knew you hurt his feelings.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.112
You can think about what's fair later.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.148
That's not what you should focus on now.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.019
"I made you sad."

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:15.321
"I'm sorry."

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.222
Yeah.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.026
-Taeheon!
-That was wonderful advice, Taeheon.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.328
His advice is kind and right.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.031
You can say,
"Let's work together next time."

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:29.802
You're right.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:32.939
Thank you.

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.024
Will he be like, "Again"?
Do you think it's okay?

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.454
Is that in your dialect?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.656
Yeah. It means "finish your plate."

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.958
Hey, Dai, about earlier…

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.961
-Sorry to interrupt.
-No problem.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:30.529
You know,

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:33.899
there's one thing I couldn't say to you.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:36.902
Well…

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:38.938
Today,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.674
by not raising my hand,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:45.811
I made you feel shocked and sad.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.347
I'm sorry.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:56.722
Thank you.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.324
I wanted to hear that.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:04.630
Thank you.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.531
Yeah.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.739
You came to see me for that.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.442
I'm happy.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:19.679
Thank you.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.749
Dinner is ready.
Is everyone in the dining room?

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:24.650
They are?

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.153
Thank you, Shun.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.088
We'll be in the dining room soon.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:29.989
I got it.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:30.923
Yeah.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.170
That's what you had to do!

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:48.240
Shun is trying to change himself
little by little, step by step.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:49.909
-Good job!
-He said he was sorry.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:53.312
He couldn't do that before.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.780
But Taeheon…

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:57.983
-I was impressed with his advice.
-That was great!

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.719
Without hurting Shun's feelings,

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:03.622
he opened Shun's eyes
and encouraged him to take action.

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:09.428
With repeated experience, they can learn
to say "thanks" and "sorry" to each other.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:12.098
Some things you can only discover
through arguments.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:15.101
Each other's dislikes, for example.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:18.504
And Dai's expression
after Shun said, "I'm sorry."

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.005
What a great expression.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:24.110
That's an expression
an actor would struggle to recreate.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.178
-No, they couldn't.
-Right?

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.181
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.783
Cheers.

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.825
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:43.195
We're all gay guys, right?

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.364
Some of us might be bisexual.

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:48.934
Do you tell your parents
about your relationships?

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.337
-I can tell them everything.
-You can?

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.838
What was their reaction?

00:12:53.939 --> 00:13:00.780
I think my mother had more
motherly concerns than I was expecting.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.984
Everyone else too? Do your parents know?

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.453
Yeah, they know.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.289
I told them
once I knew I was on this show.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.190
Really?

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.358
That's wonderful.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.729
I didn't want them hearing about it
from someone else.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.999
Did your mom take it well?

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:22.868
She said, "If you find someone nice,
bring them by."

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:24.870
From now on.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:31.544
Truthfully, I tried to tell my parents
before joining this show,

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:36.081
but I haven't been able to tell them yet.

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.318
Well, in fact,

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:42.188
my parents divorced when I was ten,

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:46.192
and I was raised by my grandma.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:52.164
Then I went to a boarding school in Korea
and studied abroad after that.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:55.734
I'm still a ten-year-old boy
in my parents' minds.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.436
Oh, I see.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.005
We've been apart for so long,

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:03.375
it's awkward both for me and for them.

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.946
Since we don't know each other very well,

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.815
I have to be careful of how I tell them.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.917
So I'm curious to know

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.253
how you all came out to your parents.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.821
What made you come out?

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:18.057
How did they react?

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.559
I'd love to know.

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:25.297
I told my parents during the last Obon.

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.333
What made you do that?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.504
I had a dilemma about my ex
and wanted their advice.

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:37.643
So it wasn't really about coming out,

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:41.080
but more that I wanted their advice.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:47.353
I didn't think coming out
to my parents would be an issue,

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:50.155
but they seemed sadder than I expected.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.960
I thought they would be
totally fine about it,

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:58.530
but they seemed sadder than I expected,

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.999
which made me sad too.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.768
Whether it's Korea or Japan,

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:06.906
I don't think the country or culture
matters so much.

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:11.143
You said your mom seemed sad, right?

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.044
Yeah.

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:16.148
My mom will likely have
the same type of reaction.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:20.052
That's what I'm expecting.

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:21.587
I'm afraid to come out.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.756
It can be scary.

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:27.693
I'm a bit worried,
but hearing your experiences,

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:32.364
I thought it may give me the boost I need.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.599
That's why I asked.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:41.173
Even if your dad and mom
don't accept your sexuality,

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.844
there's meaning and value
to the fact you're here.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:53.419
Your existence
doesn't need to be influenced by that.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:56.455
Listening to you made me feel that way.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.923
I agree with Dai.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.795
There's a lot that children learn
from their parents,

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:07.566
but there's also a lot
that parents learn from their kids too.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.936
When you choose your own happiness,

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:14.039
it may mean a totally new experience
for your parents,

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:17.977
and they may be surprised
because they know so little about it.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:21.080
But even if their reactions
are not what you expect,

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:27.386
I believe your choice
is a precious message for them.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.790
Thanks for sharing
and for listening to me.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:33.158
Same goes for us.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:42.901
Coming out is not a requirement.

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:46.505
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Do what's right for you.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:51.677
In my case, my mother passed away
before I came out.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:55.381
I came out to my father after that.

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:58.584
But my father,
who I thought was rather conservative,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.519
accepted it surprisingly well.

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:05.124
Our sexuality isn't necessarily about sex
but about our identities.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.025
Of course.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:08.460
You tell someone
what kind of person you are,

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.696
and if they accept you for it,

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.065
that can feel very self-affirming.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:17.136
Kazuto said his mother looked sad,
but we don't know why she was sad.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.872
Is she sad about the fact he's gay?

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:23.942
Or is she saddened
by the thought that her gay son

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:27.579
must navigate a society
that may be more challenging to live in?

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.514
That's right.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.083
You won't know until you talk about it.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.920
"Sad" doesn't necessarily mean
she's sad he's gay.

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:37.823
-It's not a rejection.
-Right, it may not be.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:44.730
As long as they continue
on a path that makes them happy,

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.299
I think the parents will be happy.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.667
I hope so.

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:54.907
There's one person
I want to properly get to know.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.577
I just need a little time with him.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:17:59.678
Oh, great.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.947
-You mean just the two of you?
-Sure, why not?

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.415
Sure you can.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:04.616
Then turn it over.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.385
-Turn it over?
-That's a good idea!

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:08.253
Okay, let's use the name cards.

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.056
Ikuo said it's okay.

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:13.325
Give us a sign, Ikuo.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:14.259
Okay.

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:18.564
Let's go.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.767
Good luck.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:22.935
See you.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.770
I also wanna talk to Kazuto later.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.073
-Let's talk.
-Yeah.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.676
I'm wondering something.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.313
-Ryota's going for it too.
-Oh, that's great.

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:42.154
I'm still very interested in you.

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:44.823
Even now.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.228
When you said you didn't know me yet,

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:54.566
I thought you were willing
to get to know me.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.034
Just my selfish expectation.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.772
I don't plan on giving up right now.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:10.616
How do you see me right now?

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.185
That's what I'd like to know.

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:19.158
The Ikuo around everybody else

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:22.161
and the Ikuo who was with me at the truck

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.831
are two totally different people.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:32.271
The Ikuo when we're alone
is someone I'd like to get to know,

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:36.808
but not so much the person you are
when you're with everyone else.

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:46.485
Someone who can't live without me…

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.722
It's just my own preference,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.394
but that's the sort of person
I tend to be attracted to.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:20:02.734
I can't help but feel that, for you,
it doesn't have to be me.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.779
He felt he had to be clear with him.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.081
Yes, since Ikuo pressed him for an answer.

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:17.216
Right.

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.319
Are you cold? Are you okay?

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.853
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:35.867
I feel like I haven't talked
with you much recently.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:41.773
So when Ikuo asked you to come here,
it made me want to talk to you too.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.674
Yeah.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.612
The other day…

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.016
you said you had feelings for me.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:53.485
After that,

00:20:54.419 --> 00:21:00.125
I thought a lot about
what kind of person you are to me.

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:06.398
I think that the "like" you feel for me
and the "like" I feel for you

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.600
may be different.

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:14.172
Since pretty much the beginning,

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.176
you've been easy to talk to,
maybe since we're the same age.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.114
I feel comfortable with you.

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:28.387
So the feelings aren't romantic for me,

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.788
but rather,

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:33.959
they are feelings of friendship.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.728
I don't want to ruin that.

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.232
I got this strange idea in my head,

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.235
which is why I might have been
pushing you away.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:47.139
I was a little afraid, I guess.

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:54.513
Afraid of ruining this connection I had
with you in my mind.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:22:02.154
I think it was good
that you told me your honest feelings.

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:03.855
I guess.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.162
When you're with Shun,

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:16.301
I like seeing you guys
mess around with each other.

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:20.839
Yeah, you laugh a lot.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.875
I really like that feeling

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:26.978
when you laugh at us teasing each other.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.314
It's like, "Oh, Kazuto laughed."

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:31.950
That's something that was really

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:36.188
very important for me.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.158
I really like when you laugh,

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:45.263
so even without the romance,
I've wanted to see you smile.

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:50.802
But I haven't seen it recently,

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.573
and I've missed that.

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:57.376
So, yeah,

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.980
I was sad, like,
"Oh, Kazuto hasn't smiled much."

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:03.915
So,

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.754
now that we know how we each feel,

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.156
I think that

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.760
we can enjoy our time together.

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:17.195
Yeah.

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.770
Let's enjoy our time.

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:25.704
Yeah.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:28.874
Thank you.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.841
Yeah.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.788
Oh, of course it was still a shock.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.689
-He gave his best.
-He loved him so much.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.591
Ryota had strong feelings for Kazuto.

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:48.827
He's been devoted to him.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:57.702
-It dinged. "This is a notice for you."
-Yes.

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:00.605
"The coffee truck will be closed today."

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.507
It's closed.

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:07.412
"You are going on your last private date."

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:08.580
-The last?
-The last.

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.881
This is the last date.

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.083
The last private date.

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:15.287
"Write down the name of the person
you want to go with."

00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:20.292
"You can only go on the date
if your feelings are mutual."

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:25.297
Dai and Shun will go on a date.

00:24:25.363 --> 00:24:27.499
I want to know Kazuto's feelings.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:32.304
Only one couple has been able to go
to this event each time.

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:42.841
"Now we will announce the pairs
going on the private date."

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:44.142
The first pair is…

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:52.651
Shun.

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.359
Dai.

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:04.763
FIRST PAIR
SHUN AND DAI

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:05.897
I'm relieved.

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:11.436
The second pair is…

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.804
The second pair?

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.307
Is that what it means?

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:22.948
Kazuto.

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:33.592
Alan.

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:37.028
SECOND PAIR
KAZUTO AND ALAN

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:38.029
I'm glad.

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:46.504
The third pair is…

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:48.273
-What?
-What?

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:50.909
The third pair.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:52.277
-What?
-No way.

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.945
-Who?
-Who on earth?

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:04.789
Ryota.

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:12.430
He looks so happy.

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:14.265
He looks happy.

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:23.241
Gensei.

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.342
-Really?
-Okay!

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.177
THIRD PAIR
RYOTA AND GENSEI

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:27.679
Let's have fun.

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.447
It's making me blush.

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.218
-Amazing.
-We're happy too.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.291
-They look happy.
-I'm glad.

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:43.128
-Yay!
-What? This is wonderful.

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:44.596
Three pairs is a first!

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:46.998
I'm an adult.
Why am I so happy for someone's date?

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:49.934
-We're like, "I'm happy."
-We're happy!

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:52.971
We've seen how Gensei has changed.

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:57.142
He's only had sad experiences
with romance so far,

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.243
so I'm glad.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:00.512
Ryota has changed gears.

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:03.982
We don't know if this is friendship
or love for him,

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:06.451
but isn't it wonderful how he's moving on?

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.520
-That's important.
-It's wonderful.

00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:10.588
It's because he conveyed his feelings…

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:11.923
He did all he could.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.325
…that he was able to move on in love.

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:15.860
That's what it means.

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:20.031
-And Kazuto, unexpectedly…
-Alan!

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:22.200
Alan took a step back for a while, right?

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:24.102
-Maybe that's what worked?
-Maybe.

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.005
His stance was,
"If you aren't ready, I'll wait."

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.440
That may have worked.

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:29.574
That's true.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.376
I'm glad. I wish them luck.

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:33.411
I hope their dates will go well.

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:36.047
But I kind of wanna see
Dai and Shun argue one more time.

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:37.482
Just a little.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:39.718
-Don't worry, they will.
-You're right.

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:40.685
They will.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.855
I'm already having fun.

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:45.890
Where's our room?

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:47.759
Where is it?

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.963
Go inside.

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.203
That's lit!

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:59.104
Incredible!

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:01.372
Insane!

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:02.307
It's sleek.

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.241
Yeah.

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:07.512
Did you know I'd write your name today?

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.446
Yeah.

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.251
Was it hard to decide?

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:14.252
Of course not.

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.622
There's no way.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:23.394
But the last time, I said,
"All right!" Do you remember?

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:26.998
I was way too expressive then.

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:29.901
I felt embarrassed about it later on.

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:32.337
Not this time, right?

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:33.438
This time.

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.749
Were you like that?

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:45.650
Yeah.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.951
You held back?

00:29:47.018 --> 00:29:48.319
-I did.
-Why?

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:52.657
Of course it's gonna be exciting
for those who can go on a date.

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.259
But for those who can't,

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.961
it's awkward.

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.398
I calmed myself down.

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:03.234
But I was so happy.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:08.540
At the end of the day, I have fun
and feel at home with you.

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:09.541
I'm glad.

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.411
I'm so happy to hear that.

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.948
What is this place?

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.383
What will their date be like?

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.818
Amazing!

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.520
Hello.

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:23.822
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:26.391
-Thanks for having us.
-Nice to meet you.

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:28.059
Glasswork!

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.460
That's perfect.

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:31.629
It's perfect for these two!

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:35.266
Slowly. Relax your shoulders.

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.008
Let's open this.

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:45.310
Let me see.

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:48.112
Pretty.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.848
Beautiful.

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.617
Take a look in the mirror.

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:58.289
-I'm so happy with this.
-Me too.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.124
I think it's cute.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.062
KAMOGAWA BAUM BAKERY

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.700
I often go to cafés for dates.

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:10.201
-I like cafés too.
-Yeah.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:13.972
I want to have a relaxing,
stylish dinner at the house.

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:15.940
We can't usually do that.

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:17.508
This is an ideal date.

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.778
What do you wanna eat?

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:22.080
Stew.

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:24.015
Sounds good. Perfect for this weather.

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.783
Yeah, it's a bit cold today.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.087
-We made a necklace and went to a café.
-Yes, the café.

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:31.489
-And going back home for dinner.
-To cook dinner.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:32.523
It's perfect.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:38.763
This place…

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.065
I like this place.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.368
-Yeah.
-The breeze feels nice.

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:46.070
It's gonna be great at night for sure.

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:49.574
Amazing.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.043
It's so nice.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.545
-It is.
-It's spacious.

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:58.316
Were you worried?

00:31:58.383 --> 00:31:59.217
Me?

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:00.818
Today?

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:02.353
Until my name was called,

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.757
I couldn't really smile.

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:12.697
Since we couldn't… go before,

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.935
I think this time with you
will be even more special.

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.404
I'm excited.

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:30.315
What were your relationships like?

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:32.417
My relationships were lame.

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:34.519
Most of them?

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.420
Yeah.

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:39.357
First of all,
I didn't date anyone until I was 18.

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.860
I had never had sex or even a kiss.

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:47.832
Except for the last one from New York,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.469
I want to erase my memories.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.507
Besides that one, they were all toxic.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:58.609
They were just good-looking.

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:00.812
I'm ashamed of my past self.

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:05.016
Like, "Why did I fall for this guy?"

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.920
I've never been hung up on
anyone in my life.

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.521
I see.

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:14.225
The only time in my life

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:18.296
my feelings have been tossed around

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.764
is with you.

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:24.335
And

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.138
the fact I met a person like you,

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:30.241
through whatever brought us together,

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:34.645
has been a learning experience for me.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.048
So

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:39.217
I'm enjoying it very much.

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:40.651
Yeah.

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.262
The steak is ready.

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.531
-This has to be good.
-No way it's not.

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:56.467
-Let's just eat it with salt.
-Yeah.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.538
Delish!

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.880
Delicious!

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.133
What was that?

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.568
Wait! No way!

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:34.072
That was great. It's funny
when you don't expect it from them.

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:38.910
Today, we're gonna
stay together overnight.

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:44.849
I want to know… where your feelings are.

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:49.187
When I thought it over,

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.389
I realized I'm someone

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.960
who observes the person
I'm interested in from afar.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:35:01.365
Like how they are with everyone.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:06.137
I realized
I like getting to know someone slowly.

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:11.109
Then that overnight date suddenly

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.946
gave us all this time alone together.

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:18.182
It just felt too overwhelming for me.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:25.189
I think that's why I was feeling that way
after we went home.

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:27.258
But this time

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.695
is different from the last date.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.064
We got back to being friends…

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.768
Well, that may not be
the right way to put it.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:43.374
But it alleviated my worries
and let me be myself, like I said before.

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.476
I was able to do that.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.179
Thanks to that,

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:53.184
the past few days
have been really enjoyable.

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.452
We had fun, right?

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:56.487
Yeah, I felt comfortable with you.

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.789
The reason I wrote your name today

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:02.393
is because I want
to slowly get to know you more.

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:09.500
The process of writing down names
and getting paired up

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.969
gets everyone strangely worked up,

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.672
but for me, well,

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:20.411
it's an opportunity to see various sides
of someone I'm interested in.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.581
I don't know, but I would rather

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.084
not have to worry too much about it,
you know?

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.622
When Kazuto is speaking with Alan,

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:34.425
he talks more naturally
than anyone else does.

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:35.860
You're right.

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.595
He's not overly friendly

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.764
and just more natural.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.465
He's not trying too hard.

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:46.370
Alan is adjusting to Kazuto's pace
little by little right now, right?

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.674
Cut the garlic, please.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.575
Okay.

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.311
You're always polite with me, Ryota.

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.245
Yes.

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.814
-Should I not be?
-No.

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:59.584
-Then I'll stop.
-Yes, stop.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:03.554
How big should I cut them?

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:05.089
Thin slices?

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.357
Thin slices.

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.826
Try one. I think it's good.

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:10.861
So hot.

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.264
You ate the whole bite?

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.900
-It's delicious.
-No wonder it's hot.

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.103
Cheers.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.638
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.412
It has bacon in it.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.349
I think it gave the soup great flavor.

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:34.552
Mmm, it's delicious.

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.024
I've always wanted a date like this.

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:43.527
This is kind of my ideal date.

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:47.298
It's like everything came true in a day.

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:52.503
Why did you write my name today?

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.508
Well, before…

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:00.945
I wrote your name for the first date.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:05.983
The person I wanted to go on a date with
has always been the same.

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:08.219
Thank you.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:10.488
But I didn't think I'd be able to.

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:11.889
Today.

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.227
Did it take time to decide who to write?

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:17.161
No.

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:20.031
It didn't take much time.

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.632
-It didn't take long?
-No.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:28.105
My feelings were sorted out
when I woke up this morning.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.775
So I didn't hesitate.

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:35.179
So this is what it feels like
to get to go on a date.

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.882
To have our names called.

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.784
I just felt happy about it.

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:43.354
That we both wanted to go
and were able to do so.

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.022
It's a new feeling.

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:52.863
I thought I knew you,
but I didn't really yet.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.432
Has your impression changed?

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:56.801
It's the same in a good way.

00:38:56.867 --> 00:39:00.438
I got to see more of your good qualities.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.810
We have a similar vibe when we talk.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.845
That makes me comfortable.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.080
-That's true.
-Right?

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.215
I feel we're similar in many ways.

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:15.519
I'm glad I could get to see
more of your good side.

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:18.856
I'm flattered.

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:25.496
Those two are a perfect match.
Like a married couple.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.998
Their voice volume is the same.

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:29.333
But voice volume is…

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.135
-Important.
-Yeah.

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.899
-Good night, Kazuto.
-Good night.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.409
We see each other every day now.

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:12.309
Yeah.

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:16.280
I wonder how we'd feel
if we didn't see each other for a while.

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:18.048
Yeah, same.

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.018
Would we message each other every minute?

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:24.855
Most people aren't that crazy.

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.090
-Every minute?
-You never know.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.592
Do you tend to message a lot?

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.629
I did in those toxic relationships.

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:32.997
What about the last one?

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:36.700
We didn't need to do that
in our relationship.

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.636
You guys were together every day?

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.472
What did you like about him?

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:44.408
The biggest part was

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:49.113
when we went
to his family's place in Atlanta.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.752
And there was a family gathering.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:03.227
I witnessed a perfect family
with no flaws.

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.362
I see.

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.398
There was his father, mother,

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:11.235
cousins, and older siblings.

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:15.339
And everyone got along very well.

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.374
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:19.243
I was shocked.

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:23.147
-Like, "Such a thing actually exists?"
-Yeah.

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:30.421
It made me want to have
a family gathering like that too.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:34.658
Are you

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.597
someone who believes
that male couples can have children,

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:45.970
raise them, and be able
to build a happy family?

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.505
Do you believe in that?

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:50.474
Yeah, as long as I can afford to.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:54.211
Financially and mentally.

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.180
-Why?
-That's good.

00:41:56.747 --> 00:42:00.784
That's something I strongly believe.

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:06.123
Nothing would be better than
sharing that with a like-minded partner.

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.394
I'm getting sleepy.

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:16.133
Okay, you wanna go to bed?

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:19.570
-You just wanna lie around a bit, right?
-Yeah.

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.776
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.578
Today?

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.214
I'll hold this and talk next to you.

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.115
Okay.

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:32.449
Ouch!

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:34.752
That looked painful.

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:41.559
Be careful.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:54.171
They both have strong feelings
about what a family is.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.206
Yes, Dai too.

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:58.809
They both agree on that.

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:01.478
They're a good match.

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:02.646
But in Japan,

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:07.051
it's still very difficult
for a male couple to adopt children.

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:10.888
I think "family" can take many forms.

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:11.822
I agree.

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:13.724
We have so many choices nowadays.

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:17.428
And people are pretty accepting
of however others want to live.

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:20.064
But the social system hasn't caught up.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.001
If only our society
could have systems in place

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:27.271
that would allow us to make
the choices we want.

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.973
I sincerely hope for this.

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:31.342
I agree. Next is the weather forecast.

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:35.512
Wait a minute.

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.815
Stop talking like a news presenter.

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:42.086
But, you know…

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:43.954
What?

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:45.422
Nothing.

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:48.292
-What?
-It's nothing.

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:55.099
Are you getting sleepy, sir?

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.535
I'll sleep there.

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:11.882
Hey.

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:15.052
Use my arm as a pillow.

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:16.987
Why?

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:20.924
We can be closer that way.

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:30.167
You should've brought your pillow.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:46.083
-Is this not a good idea?
-No.

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:47.985
It's good.

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.589
-Huh?
-It's totally good.

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.178
Shun.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.848
Were you waiting?

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.584
You kept me waiting too long.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.921
We finally did it.

00:46:02.993 --> 00:46:05.429
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh my!

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.831
-That was great.
-That kiss was fantastic!

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:09.833
-The buildup to that kiss!
-Yeah!

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.535
-The buildup.
-Seriously good!

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.004
That kiss scene will go down in history.

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.305
That's true.
