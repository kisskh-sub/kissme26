WEBVTT

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.114
We're home.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.949
-Welcome back.
-We're back.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.851
-Hey, guys.
-It was fun.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.419
-You had fun?
-Yeah.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.154
Yes, we had fun.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:23.923
They're back.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:25.725
Where are they?

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.261
There they are.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.134
-Welcome back!
-Yoo-hoo!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.535
-Welcome back.
-We're back.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.636
We're home.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.937
Everyone is here.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.906
Yeah, we're all here.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:40.807
Welcome back.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.009
Any developments?

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.411
Too many.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.311
Really?

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.080
There were.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.251
How about you? Any developments?

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.485
Yeah.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.187
What kind?

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:55.955
We slept together.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.191
-What?
-We slept together.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.292
You mean you had sex?

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.560
Yes.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.128
What? Really?

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.698
It's a lie.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.534
-A lie?
-Lying from the get-go.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.171
No way they'd tell us
if they really did it.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.105
Yeah?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.740
Did you guys kiss?

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.510
You did.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.254
-I see the afterglow.
-Oh, an afterglow.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.090
The kiss must've been good.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.759
-The kiss.
-The afterglow from a kiss.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.195
-The afterglow from the kiss is…
-So long!

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.830
It's lingering.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.969
-That was a great kiss.
-Shun is so transparent.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.406
Dai must be simultaneously thinking,
"Please stop" and "You're too cute."

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.311
I have a lot to ask you.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.879
Sure, ask me anything.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:56.783
When your name was called with Ryota's,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.151
you looked happy.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.285
Did I?

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:04.390
But it wasn't
an obviously happy face like Dai's.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.063
I've known for a while now

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.734
that Ryota had feelings for Kazuto.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.739
I was happy about the date itself,
but I had mixed feelings.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:21.941
I see.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.276
Yeah.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.745
-We all came back this morning, right?
-Yeah.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.682
I think Ryota looked a little sad.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.454
When Kazuto and Alan came back,

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:39.492
I sensed it bothered him a bit.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:44.164
So what are you going to do now?

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.668
Telling him how I feel right now

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:53.373
would be counterproductive, I think.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.507
At this point.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.811
I need to have emotional space

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.247
before I tell him my feelings.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.916
That would be for the best.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.652
This is something Alan said.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.655
"Ask yourself
if it'll make you happy or not

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.823
when you make a choice."

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.494
He said that's what he keeps in mind.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:18.565
I completely agree with that.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:22.035
Will it make me happy or not?

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.872
The question should be simple,
and I just need to take action.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:30.610
But even if I tell Ryota my feelings,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.079
I don't think I'll be happy.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.148
I see.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.885
I'm going to think it over tonight.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.287
But don't overthink it.

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.689
Yeah, you're right.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.059
Are you doing okay?

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:50.163
Well, the other day, I asked everyone
about their coming out experiences.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.431
Right.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.334
You guys gave me courage.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.668
But…

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.373
but I'm still scared.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.076
I don't know what to do.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.511
I'm definitely going to tell them.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.680
But how should I tell them?

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.218
They could react in a few different ways.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.254
But it's twice the shock.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:18.191
Your daughter is… No, not daughter.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:23.363
Your son is gay.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:28.735
In addition, the world will know about it.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.072
So I'm concerned about what they'll think.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:38.578
But it could be a good opportunity.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:44.951
I mean, If you hadn't done the show,
when would you have told them?

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:50.923
I didn't have a road map or specific time
I was going to tell them.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.693
-But you wanted to tell them.
-Yeah.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.928
Then it's a good opportunity.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.532
-You're right.
-You're not doing anything wrong.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.001
During my stay here,

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:07.373
I feel like I've made real connections,
not just friends who meet up for drinks.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.475
I feel supported.

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.113
I think I'll be able to tell them
without overthinking it.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.949
That's good. We both won't overthink it.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.585
-Right.
-Don't worry, you can do it.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.593
Taeheon hasn't experienced romance here,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.129
but he still has his own story going on.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:33.132
-That's true.
-I think that's really beautiful.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.968
Gensei, too, is not certain

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.639
if telling Ryota his feelings
would make him happy or not.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.540
True.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.277
Maybe he feels like troubling Ryota
wouldn't make him happy.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.778
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.690
-Eating separately?
-What?

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.992
-Why?
-Wait a minute.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.368
Good morning, Taeheon.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:21.240
I don't know what Shun is unhappy about.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.476
Well,

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:29.615
maybe he didn't like something I did.

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:30.616
You know,

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.822
perhaps something negative happened,

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.557
and there's a reaction incoming.

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.460
What happened?

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.762
-Overnight? No way.
-That's too quick.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.998
There's the ding.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.667
"Good morning."

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.902
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.671
"Today's shift will be announced."

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.006
-Here it comes.
-Please go ahead.

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.343
"Today,

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.080
Gensei will take the shift."

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:07.920
"Gensei, please choose one person
you would like to work with."

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.055
-What?
-One person?

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.457
Gen gets to choose.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.393
Gen's feelings will be made clear.

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:37.750
Please work with me.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:38.651
Me?

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.087
Is it okay?

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.021
I'd love to.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.727
Have fun.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.931
Can I put some makeup on you?
You're looking tired today.

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.201
-You really look tired.
-Please.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.770
-That's rude.
-He's got dark circles.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:05.244
Let's avoid covering the freckles.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.612
Yeah, please.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.681
-That's part of my charm.
-Yeah.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.902
-Great!
-He looks amazing.

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.504
You could grow out the back.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.306
-Starting now?
-Yeah.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.442
It's nice to do hair and makeup
for someone you love.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:39.645
When doing makeup,
his serious face is up close to you.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.380
Right. Your heart would pound.

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.629
-Okay.
-All right.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.565
Did you practice drawing?

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.967
No, I didn't.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:17.316
You could work as a real barista anywhere.

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.586
Your movement is graceful and efficient.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:23.189
Thank you. I'm flattered.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.591
Here's the guava juice.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.961
-Feel free to use the straws.
-Thank you.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.529
Thank you very much.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.333
All right!

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.203
1,900 yen.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.974
-We surpassed the first day.
-We did.

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:44.143
Let's do it.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.177
A fond memory.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.683
-The handwriting incident.
-Right, the misunderstanding.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:01.460
Let's make a list
of what we're doing today.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:04.597
-Gym and sunbathing.
-And the pool, right?

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.065
May I be by myself?

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.466
-What?
-Why?

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.535
It's okay, but what happened?

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:12.071
I can't enjoy myself if we're together.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:16.175
I need a little space.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:17.777
From us?

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:20.579
From that person.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:23.349
From Dai?

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.250
Yeah.

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:26.886
Dai, you must be wondering why.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:31.157
If you have something to say,
you need to talk about it.

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:32.958
Feelings can change.

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:37.863
It's a hassle.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.369
-What about you, Dai? Anything?
-No.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.403
-Nothing?
-No.

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.877
Dai may have had enough…

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.846
It's exhausting.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.347
He keeps pouring his love…

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.750
-But it's not accumulating.
-That's right.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:00.086
What happened?

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:07.460
There's one thing that comes to mind.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.162
Well, yesterday,

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.299
before I took a bath,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.536
Shun said, "You can wear this T-shirt.
I just wore it for a sec."

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.006
I said, "I'm good. I have a new one."

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.109
But he insisted that it was clean.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.911
So I just said "okay" and took it.

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:30.683
But I just wore what I was going to wear.

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:36.055
I put on my own shirt
and went upstairs for a face mask,

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.957
and Shun said, "You're not wearing it."

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.092
-That's definitely it.
-Yeah.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.395
Everyone already knows.

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.397
-Yeah.
-How Shun thinks.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:50.970
"I'm sorry for not wearing your T-shirt"?
Do I even need to apologize for that?

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:52.772
You know what…

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:57.042
what you're seeing
and feeling on your end.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.512
Why don't you just be honest with him?

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.214
It's not that I don't want to tell him.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:07.119
It feels wrong that I have to initiate.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.123
Let's chat.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.391
-Sure. Are you sure?
-Yeah.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.959
I'm a bit worried.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:14.994
About what?

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.295
-About you.
-Me?

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:17.196
Yeah.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:20.866
It's painful to watch you.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:21.867
For real?

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.903
You hold yourself back for him.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.172
He tosses your feelings around.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:30.442
I'm thinking it's too painful for you.

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:35.181
I want to keep trying…
even if it wears me down.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.019
I don't know which of us
will wear down first.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:47.726
You were so supportive of me,
so I wanted to support you.

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:49.295
Oh, you're sweet.

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.765
You know, if there's something

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.100
that's making you react that strongly,

00:13:55.634 --> 00:14:02.474
it means you must be feeling something
in terms of romance, right?

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.109
That's true. But I…

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:07.947
That's what I thought.
I'll support you as much as I can.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:08.848
Yeah.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.519
Does he like Dai?

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.689
That face means he likes Dai, right?

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:21.327
But it could be that he can't let go
of his feelings for Kazuto, right?

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:23.929
Yes, that's also possible
from his expression.

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:27.333
-What does his expression mean?
-I know.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.601
Not again, Shun…

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.736
Shun and Dai will do this forever.

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:33.005
Forever. It's a cycle.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:36.208
Dai says he wants to keep trying
even if it wears him down.

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.710
That's impressive.

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.979
Not many people could say that.

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.781
-I've never heard anyone say that before.
-Incredible.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.984
He's never felt this way before.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.285
-Right.
-That's true.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.153
It's precious to him.

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:51.423
What a waste.

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.392
Yeah, I know.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.061
It's fine though.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.965
Are you going to talk to him?

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:03.469
Yeah, I'll find a good time for it.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.338
I'll talk to him.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.041
Tell us if you need anything.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.126
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:30.429
It's time for a nap.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:31.330
I see.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:33.866
What's going on?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.701
What's up?

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.604
What caused this?

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.573
-I don't want to tell you.
-Why?

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:43.509
It's minor.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:48.647
It's big for me,
but others would say, "What the heck?"

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.782
I don't wanna say.

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.552
What? I really don't understand.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:59.058
What is Ikuo thinking?
Why is he talking to Shun?

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.927
We don't know the answer to that.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:06.298
I'm sure he wants to do something
for you guys.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.502
But it's probably
an unnecessary interference in your eyes.

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:14.106
I'm sure he's not trying to be malicious.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.308
Yeah, that's true.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:19.278
I talk a lot,

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:23.983
but I'm bad at articulating
my thoughts to someone.

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:28.587
The frustration of being unable
to find the words makes me emotional.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.022
-Yeah.
-We get it.

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.425
-I'm afraid of that, so I'm intentionally…
-You don't want to hurt him.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:38.731
That's why I try to
temporarily distance myself.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.066
That's where I'm at now.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.705
You both know that your feelings mesh.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:50.309
But if you don't put it into words
while we're living together,

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.611
it worries everyone else too.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:56.248
I think you two should talk about it,

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:59.118
but if that's hard,
you could do it in our presence too.

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.421
Then I'll do that.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.655
-You want us there?
-Yeah.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:08.427
I want to hear everyone's opinion too.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:09.728
Should I call them?

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:10.896
Are you okay?

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.831
You're ready? I'll go get them.

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.333
Okay.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:25.210
Hey, guys.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:29.081
Well, after Shun and I discussed this,

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:31.650
well,

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:39.658
we agreed he wants to convey his feelings
with everyone present.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.261
Can we have a moment of your time?

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:45.330
Hey, why did you do that? Seriously.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:53.906
-What made you think it's a good idea?
-I'm not trying to force you.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.942
But everyone here is tiptoeing around you.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:00.879
I didn't want to just say,
"Dai, go talk to him."

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.715
For those reasons…

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:06.285
-Did you ask him to talk?
-No.

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.587
-Shun asked you?
-I approached him--

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:09.721
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.204
What? It got really nasty, didn't it?

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.005
Oh no.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.074
Humans are difficult, aren't they?

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.543
Ikuo cares though.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.080
Dai's feeling that it's not their business
is understandable too.

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.152
-I'm sorry, but I can't be present.
-It's okay.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.055
I can't be there.

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:48.994
Calm down and relax for a while.
Just be yourself.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:50.796
Yeah.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.366
-Is he gonna come?
-No.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.769
Better to let Dai talk with him alone.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:58.670
I see.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:08.080
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.550
I'm sorry that I poked my nose into this.

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:15.187
-I acted without permission.
-But you had good intentions.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:17.556
-Yeah, but…
-Then that's fine.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:22.161
Shun has his own feelings,
and so does Dai.

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:25.964
Whether there's romance or not,

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:31.203
I thought it was important to have
an environment everyone could enjoy.

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.272
But right now,

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:36.575
I truly regret my actions.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.780
You wanted to do something to help.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.716
Yeah, that came through.

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:46.251
We understood.

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:49.454
We know you didn't have
malicious intentions.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.658
You just want everyone to be happy.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:55.027
Yeah.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.969
Fundamentally, we all feel the same.

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:05.604
Alan, can you come?

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.510
Thank you.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:18.483
This was the first time I felt like
someone interrupted my rhythm with Shun.

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:23.288
It was important to me
to talk to him at the right time.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:29.328
I wanted to hear how Shun really feels.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:35.500
But Ikuo's opinion now taints that,

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.803
which makes me feel sick.

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:40.906
Now Shun wants to talk
in front of everyone.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:43.075
But about that…

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.744
I'm against it.

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:50.716
If Shun has something to say,
he should tell you directly.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.652
He's saying he wants to hear
everyone's opinions.

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:58.056
He didn't say he'll talk
but that he'll listen to our thoughts.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:05.564
I think if everyone else's opinions
influence how he feels,

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.266
then it's no longer really Shun.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:11.270
I think he's feeling insecure somehow.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:13.705
He simply doesn't have the confidence.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.108
He's feeling afraid.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.478
I don't know. This is just me talking.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:23.448
What if I can't handle what he says?

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:24.916
You can handle it.

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:26.885
I'm scared.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.587
Of course it's scary.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:31.156
But just think positively.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.592
And don't forget your kindness.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:38.130
Be kind to yourself, and be kind to Shun.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.968
Your irritation and anger
will disappear before you know it.

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:47.939
Kindness truly has magical powers.

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:50.208
So

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:54.046
grab Shun's hand
and go talk with him right now.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.214
I think it's an important time.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:01.987
That boy is highly empathetic.

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.789
-What a wonderful person.
-Amazing.

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.557
I want to live with him.

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:08.460
-You want to live with him?
-Sounds good.

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:10.529
Shun.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.899
Let's go to the dining room.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.967
Okay.

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:21.773
Thank you, guys.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.216
You need a hug.

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:33.985
I'm sorry.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:36.321
It's okay. You're a kind, amazing man.

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:01.446
Need a drink? Oh, you've got water.

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:12.391
This is how people grow.

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.192
He felt he had to do something.

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:15.894
-Like he needed to try.
-Yeah.

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:19.464
He thought if they all talked,
they could work it out.

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:26.238
I want to know why you acted like you did.

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.408
Why do you want to know now?

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.710
I've always wanted to know.

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.945
Why didn't you ask me then?

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:38.917
I'm guessing
this has to do with the T-shirt.

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:42.053
I didn't want you to

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:47.092
take it for granted
and think I'll always come back

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:49.428
every time something happens.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:51.963
I thought about it a lot.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.600
The T-shirt was the beginning.

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:56.501
Yeah.

00:23:57.369 --> 00:24:02.340
I told you I was in love with someone
until recently, right?

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:06.978
I compared you to him.

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:07.913
Yeah.

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:12.818
He was always wearing my T-shirt.

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.688
It was a way of showing love.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.292
Wearing your T-shirt?

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:24.429
It's hard being compared to an ex.

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:28.233
You're more sensitive than I thought.

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:33.572
This was a good reminder
that you're a delicate person.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:38.877
If it's something like this,
I can happily handle it.

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.246
Yeah.

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:44.616
It's totally okay
to compare me with your ex.

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:50.922
But if you can let go
of what we shared so easily,

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.458
it makes me sad.

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:58.196
I don't want to let those things go.

00:24:58.697 --> 00:25:00.999
So, by talking about this face to face,

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:05.237
I believe we'll be able
to move forward again.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.647
But if something like
this T-shirt thing happens again,

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:20.118
and if I ever say something like,
"Don't talk to me,"

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:21.853
we'll end up

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:24.289
like this again.

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.991
I don't think so.

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:34.132
I'm confident that I won't let it happen.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:40.972
Yeah.

00:25:46.845 --> 00:25:47.879
Thank you.

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:52.717
Do you wanna go back?

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:55.954
All right.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.401
So that kind of, you know…

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.236
-We're back.
-Welcome back.

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:12.370
Welcome back.

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.738
I want to see your face.

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.577
Come on, you're smiling, right?

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.179
I know you're smiling!

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.150
See? You're smiling!

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.751
Is he embarrassed?

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:32.424
That was wonderful!

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.826
-Dai is wonderful.
-Dai was amazing.

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:37.128
He's too perfect, isn't he?

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:40.198
His expression when he said
he'd handle it was so great.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.366
It was incredible.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.636
"This'll happen again."
"I'm confident I won't let it happen."

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:47.572
Can you say something like that?

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.673
He was stunning!

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.109
I kind of wanna be like Shun.

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:58.650
Shun may have gotten close
to others before,

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:03.021
but when he acted the way he did,
they may have tired of him.

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.923
That may have happened before.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.928
It seems like he's checking to see
whether this person will stay by his side

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:13.465
no matter how far he pushes it.

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:16.768
He's testing Dai's love again and again.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:20.505
Makes you realize there are
many types of people on earth.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.310
-This is a microcosm of society.
-It really is!

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:26.811
Doesn't it feel good?

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:35.320
The sound of the sea is soothing.

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:36.287
Yeah.

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.823
It feels good.

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:52.871
Our stay at the house
feels both long and short-lived.

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:58.843
But I feel my days have been fulfilling.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.781
Well,

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:08.019
I wanted to tell you
that I enjoyed being at the Green Room

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:12.023
because you've been there.

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:16.861
I misunderstood at first though.

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:18.997
I thought you wrote me the letter.

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:20.565
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.566
Oh, I see.

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:27.038
But that part didn't really bother me.

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:30.642
On the contrary, because of that,

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:35.747
I became interested in you.

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:39.050
That was one of the key motivators.

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.487
Halfway into it,

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:46.357
I learned you had feelings for Kazuto.

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:47.525
Me?

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:48.460
Yeah.

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:54.466
And seeing you face your feelings head-on

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:59.070
made me see how true you are to yourself.

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:02.207
You're honest with yourself.

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:05.410
That part of you is really cool.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.345
I really liked it.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:11.449
You're attractive, to begin with.

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:14.652
I found myself
wanting to support you somehow.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.089
I think I've accomplished that.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.558
During my stay at the house.

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:25.930
And I think it's time.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.901
I

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:35.907
will be leaving the Green Room today.

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:37.942
-Today?
-Today.

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.344
-No way. What?
-Yeah.

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:41.746
I haven't told anybody else.

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:43.481
What?

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:44.816
Are you serious?

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:47.352
-I'm so sad!
-Don't go.

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:51.322
You have no regrets?

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.324
-No regrets.
-No?

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:55.860
-You did all you could?
-I did.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:58.663
Yeah, I was able to convey my feelings.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:02.100
I didn't want to require an answer.

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.769
I just wanted to express
my honest feelings.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.938
That's what I wanted.

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:11.242
So… do your best.

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.379
I want you to do your best.

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:18.049
Don't worry. Because you're attractive.

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.552
Yes, thank you.

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:22.053
-Be confident.
-Yes.

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:27.258
I'm glad I was able to meet you
at the Green Room.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.499
Well, I think we shared
many feelings together.

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:38.002
I really enjoyed that.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.840
So saying goodbye to you here

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:45.043
is sad for me.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:48.746
I'm going to miss you.

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.126
-This is the first day.
-Great.

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.634
And his last words were,

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:12.437
"I admire you."

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.674
Ryota is going to make one for me.

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:17.775
What? I'm jealous.

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:23.581
I want to work with you.

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:28.953
-Gensei.
-Okay!

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:44.102
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:13.865
I have an announcement.

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:15.667
What is it?

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:21.606
I will be leaving the Green Room today.

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:37.088
I've been practicing that for a while.

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:43.594
But I can't help but cry in front of you.

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:51.769
In my mind,
I've accomplished what I came here for.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.572
I gained a lot.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:57.675
I'm just grateful.

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:03.247
I've said everything I wanted to say.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:11.889
I was able to enjoy a party
with everyone on my last night.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.958
I have no regrets.

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:18.563
Thank you very much.

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:23.735
Enjoy the rest of your time here, guys.

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.076
I can't take this.

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.513
All right.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.621
My shoes…

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.091
See you later.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:48.893
-See you later.
-See you.

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:50.995
I'm off.

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.463
-Thank you.
-Take care.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.766
Míng tiān jiàn.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.553
I did all I could. I have no regrets.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.755
I experienced things I normally wouldn't.

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:20.892
I was able to express my opinions.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.794
In those aspects,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.999
I truly think living together
helped me grow as a person.

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:33.037
Everything I experienced here
is a treasure. All of it.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:46.017
Gensei encouraged me
to tell Kazuto how I felt.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.587
I want to spend my time here
without regrets.

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:52.623
I want to do everything I can.

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:57.095
I can't believe it.

00:34:57.161 --> 00:35:00.431
-Gensei…
-He left the Green Room.

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:01.732
But, you know,

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:05.336
Gensei was relatively reserved
from the beginning.

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:08.739
He couldn't express his feelings
very much, but in the end,

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:12.844
I'm glad he was able to leave
feeling accomplished.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.745
He really grew as a person.

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:17.448
From our standpoint,
he could've stayed until the end.

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:18.816
-Yeah.
-I wanted him to stay.

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:22.587
I thought he could spend
more time with everyone.

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:25.690
He's so fond of everyone there,
but it must be tough

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:28.759
to experience unrequited love
every minute and every second.

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.161
-That's hard.
-It's very hard.

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.663
So even though
it's just a little more time,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.833
I understand how Gensei
would rather not endure that pain

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.368
now that he's done all he could.

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:41.205
It's so heartbreaking.
Everyone was crying.

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:45.843
It goes to show how wonderful
their experience was living together.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.044
Right.

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.615
When I'd wake up,

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:54.152
I'd open the door,
and Gensei would come out.

00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:56.420
But he didn't today.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.556
Don't say that. I miss him.

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.825
I'd say, "Gensei,"
and he'd reply, "Hi, Tae."

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:05.863
May I?

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.231
Please go ahead.

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:08.199
All right.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.038
-"Good morning."
-Good morning.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:16.407
"Today's shift will be announced."

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:21.312
"Ikuo will take the shift today."

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:23.648
Me?

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:29.287
"Ikuo, please choose a person
you would like to work with."

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.055
Yes.

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.645
Dai.

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.922
Will you go with me?

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:09.894
Please.

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.329
I'd love to.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.269
Hello. Wait a minute. I'll go to him.

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.304
Would you like a latte?

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:23.708
Cold? With ice?

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:25.443
-A cold one.
-Yes.

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.413
Why isn't the coffee coming out?

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:32.717
-It just stopped working?
-Yeah.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:34.919
-Even though it's on?
-Yeah.

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.091
It broke.

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.393
What should we do?

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.364
I don't think that's it.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.965
Oh, it's working!

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.272
-It's running?
-Yup.

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.574
-Yay!
-All right!

00:37:57.508 --> 00:38:00.011
I'm relieved. Thank you very much!

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:02.179
I was in a panic.

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.115
We're sorry for the wait.

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.383
Thank you. Good luck.

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.917
Thank you.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:11.656
Seriously, I was panicked.
Thank you, Mr. Ikuo, for keeping calm.

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:12.890
No problem at all.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.959
We're training to make coffee.

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.395
-We can have some now?
-Yes, please!

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.030
I'm going to have one, then.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.565
Good job, Mr. Ikuo.

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:24.235
Here, before these get cold.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.270
Here are two small hot lattes.

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:29.974
Here are small hot lattes. Two.

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.376
We'll now make the iced and the hot.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.411
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.347
-Can you grab a medium lid?
-Okay.

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:38.015
Sorry, I know you're busy. Thanks.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.084
We're both busy.

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:42.286
Let's support each other.

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:43.454
You're amazing.

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:46.724
We're sorry for the chaos.
Thank you for the wait.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.427
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much. Take care.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.531
-Can you see them?
-Yeah!

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.932
-No way.
-By the window.

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.634
-Where?
-By the window.

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.402
Second from the top.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.404
Toward the front.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:05.476
I'm glad!

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:07.878
That was wonderful.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.214
-Yeah!
-So amazing.

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.490
I wanna know why you chose me.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.026
It's simple.

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.363
There's something I wanted to say.

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.031
About yesterday.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:30.801
Hey, why did you do that? Seriously.

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:36.907
I never imagined
my actions would cause so much trouble.

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:37.808
Yeah.

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:41.679
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.614
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:48.986
-But there's another personal reason.
-What is it?

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:54.992
I think everyone thinks
I have feelings for Kazuto.

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:58.095
But it's already over in my mind.

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:01.132
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:03.734
-I thought you'd definitely choose Kazuto.
-I know.

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:08.839
I wanted to reset my feelings
before expressing them again.

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:10.741
-To who?
-You.

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.410
-Me?
-Yeah.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:14.378
It's Dai.

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.679
We were right.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.681
-It was Dai.
-It was.

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.251
I've been thinking about it.

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:21.952
-Here's a letter…
-What?

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:23.988
…that I wrote.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.957
I thought I'd read it.

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.794
-"Dear Dai."
-Yes.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.198
"I didn't think I could convey
my feelings well, so I put it in writing."

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.001
"First, I want to ask,

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:38.836
are you happy now?"

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:43.707
"I was glad to meet
someone the same age as me."

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.509
"I wanted to get to know you."

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:47.945
"We got along,
and I thought you were fun."

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:49.513
"The day of the go-kart contest,

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.417
I had decided I'd ask Kazuto out
on a date if I won,

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:56.287
but, in fact,
you were in the back of my mind."

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.690
"Though I had feelings for you,

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:03.027
as I learned about the relationship
between you and Shun,

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.095
I found myself stepping back."

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.065
"I don't mean to compare,

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:13.304
but when thinking about the ten things
I like about my crush, as Shun suggested,

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.774
I easily came up with more for you."

00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:20.411
You like Kazuto, right?

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.680
What do you like about him?

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:27.685
I hear it's a good sign
if you can come up with ten things.

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:35.092
"When I thought about my feelings
honestly, my feelings for you grew."

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:38.796
"Sometimes I felt a bit jealous
when you were with Shun."

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:41.999
"I often went to you for advice."

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.902
"I also heard a lot about Shun from you."

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:49.306
"At times, I saw you treated
in a way I would've hated."

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:51.609
"I wouldn't let you feel anxious."

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.677
"I wouldn't let you feel bad."

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.614
"I'd show you such loving care."

00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:01.719
"I'd put your feelings first,
and I'd make you happy right now."

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:07.758
"Can you think of me as a romantic partner
and not just as a friend?"

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:22.072
He conveyed his feelings honestly to me.

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:27.011
I'm happy but confused.

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:47.898
Are you happier being loved
or being the one to love?

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.500
Yeah, this is like a TV drama!

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:52.303
-Yeah, it is.
-This is what happens on TV dramas!

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:54.038
And the next one is the last one!

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.506
-No!
-I don't want that!

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.841
-No way they could wrap it up.
-What'll happen?

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.110
How could it wrap up
in just one more episode?
