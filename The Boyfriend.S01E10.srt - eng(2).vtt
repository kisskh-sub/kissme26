WEBVTT

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.077
"I wouldn't let you feel anxious."

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.013
"I'd show you such loving care."

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.049
"Can you think of me
as a romantic partner?"

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.086
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.794
When you first arrived,

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.164
I almost had a crush on you.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.168
You have a sparkle but also a manly side.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.104
You're good at household chores too.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.775
I thought, "Wow, he's great."

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:46.613
You really captured my heart.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.115
But on the other hand,

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:54.421
I also feel really comfortable
around someone like Shun.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.389
And

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.429
it's been a long time since I could enjoy
a comfortable silence with someone.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.763
And that's Shun.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.601
It's not anything about you,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.805
but that Shun is too important to me.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.973
At this point,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.076
I'm not in a place

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:23.116
where I can see myself
with anyone other than Shun.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.721
Thank you for everything today.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.998
Dai's love is unwavering.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.801
-He's certain of his feelings.
-Straight as an arrow.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:42.969
But Ikuo too…

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.239
-He looked great.
-Yeah, refreshed.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.642
Maybe Ikuo wanted a clear rejection.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.611
-Otherwise, he's left wondering.
-True.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.280
People have their own pace, don't they?

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.315
Everyone's different.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.451
It's rare to find a perfect fit.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.953
-It's a miracle.
-Right.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.756
"Good morning."

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.926
"You have three days left
of living together at the Green Room."

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.229
Three days…

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.730
"For today,

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.234
Kazuto will be taking the shift."

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:19.506
"Kazuto, please choose one person
you would like to work with."

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.407
One person?

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.209
JAPANESE FOOD CHEF

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.277
Okay.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.079
There isn't much time left.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:30.884
We don't really know how he feels
after his date with Alan.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.752
I want to see Kazuto's true desire.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.765
-He chose Alan.
-Alan.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.836
Let's go.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.803
BRAZILIAN IT WORKER

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.971
Sure!

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.072
All right!

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.542
Let's have fun.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.043
MODEL AND CAFÉ BOSS

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.711
-Let's have fun.
-Yeah.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.064
There they are.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.673
-Please drive.
-Okay.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.175
-This is for you and Alan.
-What?

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.176
I made you lunch.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.744
Wow, seriously?

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.179
-Thank you.
-Seriously, thanks.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.380
-I'm happy.
-Good luck.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.448
Thank you.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.283
We're off.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.551
Thank you, Ryota.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.485
-See ya.
-Thanks.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.221
-See you.
-See ya.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.712
Ryota made lunch for them.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.747
That was heartbreaking.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.418
-A heartbreaking story.
-In the rain too!

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:22.055
The least he could do for his crush
was to make sandwiches.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.258
He still wanted to express his love.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.360
It's so gut-wrenching.

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.196
I really want Ryota to find happiness.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.599
Hey, Kazuto.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.435
Nice.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.203
Should I look away from the camera?

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.373
No, look into it and be cutesy.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:43.743
Sorry.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.511
It's cute that he did it.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.814
What are you doing?

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.350
I took a photo of someplace. Sorry.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:52.852
Hello.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.654
A drip coffee and latte.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.956
A drip coffee and latte? Thank you.

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.863
Here's your small hot latte first.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.997
-Thank you.
-Here.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.833
-Your drip coffee.
-Sorry for the wait.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.234
Sorry for the wait.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.535
Thank you so much.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.703
Thank you.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:14.807
I'm hungry.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.543
-I'm looking forward to Ryota's lunch.
-Ryota's lunch.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:23.683
Delicious.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.051
Thank you, Ryota.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.121
He's so kind.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:40.400
He's wanted to talk to you a few times.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.435
-Just the two of you, right?
-Yeah.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.878
We also made latte art together yesterday.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.621
I could hear your voices yesterday.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.723
-You could?
-Yeah, you were laughing.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.291
Did you have fun?

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.225
Yeah.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.896
It was complicated.

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:14.333
-Complicated?
-What was?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.102
The latte art? Or your feelings?

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.237
-Which one?
-Which was complicated?

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.338
Probably both.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.475
-Time to close?
-Let's close shop.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.464
I have something to tell you.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:48.868
There's… something I need to say.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.102
Yeah.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:57.410
I've grown in so many ways
because I met you.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.813
I'm really…

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.284
Articulating my thoughts

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.321
is something I haven't really done before.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.089
It's very difficult for me.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.925
When I see you,

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.929
with your own thoughts and opinions,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.033
expressing yourself in words to others…

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:27.240
There were so many times
I wanted to be like you.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.209
I'm glad that we met.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.212
I'm so grateful.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:38.184
We have three days left,
including today, well, two,

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.854
and when I think about when this will end,

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:46.158
I can't help
but think about what comes after.

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:49.028
I've been thinking about it.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:56.335
In my mind,
you're special compared to the others.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.372
At least for me.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:06.679
But I still don't have a clear answer

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.615
as to what my feelings for you are.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.153
I've been thinking about my feelings,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.556
and I'm still in an uncertain state.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:23.696
Once I'm in love with someone,
I tend to always want to be with them.

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:30.269
But it's usually taken a long time
to feel that way in the past.

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:39.011
So trying to make a decision
during my time at the Green Room

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.349
is difficult for me, so…

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:53.593
I wanted to at least tell you
how grateful I am to have met you

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:56.429
while we're still here.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.434
Thank you.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.004
-Thank you to you too.
-For sharing your feelings.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.720
Here.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.160
Like this?

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:30.963
All right.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:01.861
Alan's situation has become
a bit complicated.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:06.532
He normally doesn't show anxiety,
but in the last scene, he looked worried.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.001
It's the first time
I've seen that expression on him.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.270
And coming from Kazuto,

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.540
it could sound like a farewell as well.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.409
He didn't have to say anything,

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:21.981
and he could've slowly developed
a relationship over time.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:25.117
Instead, he told Alan
that meeting him helped him grow.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:28.888
"Thank you for everything."
That's how it sounded.

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:32.091
He stayed overnight twice with Alan,

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:36.262
but he couldn't get into that mood.

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:40.466
That may mean he never will.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.835
-You're right.
-It could be.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.409
Two days left, including today.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:53.579
Oh no.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.150
-It dinged.
-There it is.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.419
-Do the honors, Ikuo.
-I'll do it.

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:03.255
I'm going to read it out loud.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:06.358
"The coffee truck will be closing today."

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.860
We're closing shop.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.330
"The last shift will be announced."

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:17.136
"Shun will take the shift today."

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:23.008
"Shun, please choose one person
you would like to work with."

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:24.543
One person?

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:54.874
Please work with me.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.208
My pleasure.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.710
-Dai.
-It's Dai.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:58.844
As expected.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.347
He's got a wonderful expression
when he's happy.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.682
Dai is very expressive. It's charming.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.633
Don't argue.

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:22.768
I know.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.405
-Of course they'd say that.
-Nice.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.407
Everyone knows already.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:29.975
Time flies.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:31.911
Today's the last day.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:50.863
All right.

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.136
This is the last shift.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.207
Has coming here changed you in any way?

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:03.843
Yeah, I think my sense of values

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.446
has become more flexible.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.781
Yeah?

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.617
Yeah. I prejudged people before.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.553
By their appearance.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:19.792
Like, "That person must be like this.
I don't want to get involved."

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:20.726
Right.

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.463
Because of that habit, when I met people…

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:29.101
You were closing off opportunities.

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:34.373
That's a huge improvement for Shun.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.674
I think it's great.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.511
It's important to interact
with various people, even if forced.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.814
He may have been unable to get close

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:45.017
to people with whom
he could've in the past.

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.952
In that sense, it was a huge gain for him.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.788
It's the last day. Crazy, isn't it?

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:50.723
Yeah.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.325
I wanted to stay at least two more months.

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:09.808
Wait a minute.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.143
I'm stoked!

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.180
-They're good buddies. Great friends.
-Oh, to be young again!

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:18.217
-Oh, to be young again!
-It's so wonderful to see!

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.252
So awesome!

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:27.126
I want to surprise them.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.395
Let's make some lunch and…

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:31.330
Bring our own aprons.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.698
That's a great idea!

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.300
All right.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.177
Would you like some coffee?

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.479
Would you like some coffee?

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.968
This is moving.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:46.271
-A tale of youth, friendship, and love.
-So amazing!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.110
What? The tablet dinged.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:56.548
"You'll now go out for the last dinner
you'll share as housemates."

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:57.916
Dinner?

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.618
-Could it be…
-Amazing.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.222
"Please dress up in the Green Room."

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:04.223
What?

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.458
-I'm excited.
-Yay!

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.127
I'm so excited.

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.728
-"Dress up"?
-I'm not sure.

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.998
-This is exciting.
-I've got goosebumps.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.233
Goosebumps!

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:17.036
-They're going to dress up.
-What? That's great too!

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.071
-Fantastic!
-Going somewhere nice?

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.073
Wow, I'm super excited!

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:44.196
So cute!

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.899
-They look great.
-So handsome!

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:48.534
So cool!

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.702
All of them look good.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:53.405
Wonderful. They each have their own style.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.740
Very nice.

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:04.083
I'm too excited.

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:06.118
Wow! Crazy!

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:10.889
This is lit!

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:19.298
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.467
This is fantastic.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:24.937
Let's have a toast.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.106
To our last supper.

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.041
Unbelievable, right?

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:30.642
Thank you, guys!

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.244
-Thank you!
-Cheers.

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.145
Cheers.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.621
Jeez, it smells so good!

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:44.957
So good.

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:45.858
I love it.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.796
-It's tasty, isn't it?
-Yeah, really good.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.466
I'm glad we got
to spend this time together.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.236
Instead of a date.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.671
I'm glad we're all together.

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:05.644
Since we've been living together,
we share so many inside jokes.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:10.716
Anyone else on the outside
wouldn't understand.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:13.519
-They've become our private jokes.
-That's true.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.288
I'll probably laugh to myself
as I remember.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.789
After our reentry into society.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.792
Did you say, "reentry"?

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.595
I mean, we're in our own world.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.863
I suppose right now.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.898
Right?

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.033
So it's like our "reentry."

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:40.646
I know our precious memories together
will give me solace in the future.

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:45.751
Just everyday things
like washing dishes, having a meal,

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.719
doing our skincare routine,

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:49.154
hanging the laundry,

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.057
making dinner and eating again.

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:55.727
You guys were all there.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.763
So I'll be doing the same things…

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:58.764
Oh, I know.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.967
…but you guys won't be there.

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:06.838
I know my memories with you all

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.708
will support me and keep my spirits up.

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:12.544
I'm really glad
I made the decision to come here.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:17.182
Every time someone left
or someone new joined,

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.785
seeing your faces and reactions…

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:23.021
We didn't know each other at first,

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:26.525
but I could feel our bond grow stronger.

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:31.997
My experience here has been irreplaceable.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.368
I'll never forget it.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:48.680
LAST DAY OF LIVING TOGETHER

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:58.150
Each object in the house feels precious.

00:21:58.216 --> 00:21:59.584
-All of it.
-I know!

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:03.088
It was like a summer break for adults.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.425
Everyone is from similar
but different backgrounds.

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.360
And they're all different ages.

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:10.662
We don't see this kind of community often.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:13.298
-I found that wonderful.
-I agree.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:16.768
They got to confide in each other.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.537
They're BFFs.

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:20.439
-Totally BFFs!
-Yeah.

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.508
-So this is what "BFFs" means.
-This is what BFFs are.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:24.543
That's right.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:26.078
-This is it.
-I see.

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:28.046
And now it's the last day.

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:30.949
Each cast member
will find their "answers."

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.485
What's going to happen?

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.520
-Oh no.
-I don't want it to end.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:38.190
-I want to see more.
-I'll miss them.

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.758
Does it feel real to you?

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:41.293
No.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.627
It doesn't feel real.

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.029
It was my spring of youth.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.798
We learned a lot.

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:51.570
Just having someone come down
in the morning made me very happy.

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:52.704
You know?

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.775
I thought I liked being by myself.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:23:01.747
But I feel so lonely
when I imagine my life alone again.

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:07.252
I just want to say thank you
to all of you.

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:11.323
I enjoyed living with you.

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.793
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.832
I will be leaving this house…

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:23.769
first.

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:25.971
Seriously?

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:28.440
There's something I want to tell you.

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:34.513
Well, unfortunately,
I didn't get to experience romance,

00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:39.651
but more importantly,
I learned something valuable.

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:42.087
I learned so much from all of you.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.425
To be honest,

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.493
before I joined,

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:49.895
I wasn't able

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:57.335
to tell my parents
that it's men I'm interested in.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:00.038
I joined because I wanted to tell them,

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.875
but I still had my doubts
until halfway through.

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:10.715
I thought maybe I wouldn't have to do it
if they didn't find out about this show.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.719
I would get caught up in that thought.

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.521
But after confiding in you

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:19.224
after our conversation,

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.359
I feel like I've found my answer.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:25.464
Since I now have eight friends,

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.802
I'll go back to see my family
and be able to tell them proudly.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:44.449
I can't look at your faces right now
because it'll make me cry,

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.220
but thank you so much.

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:53.091
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:12.377
I would like to…

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:18.617
live stronger than I ever have before.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:20.719
Let's all do our best.

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.600
Thank you, Taeheon.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.605
I had a lot of fun with you.

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:43.842
Thank you.

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:54.686
Your mom and dad
will understand when they watch this.

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.190
Thank you, Taeheon.

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:00.091
Thank you.

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.798
I'll always have your back.

00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:13.171
Thank you, Ikuo.

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.639
I know you had a tough time.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.509
I'll always have your back.

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:24.749
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Ryota.

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.286
I can't…

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:32.724
Thank you, Shun.

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:38.496
Remember to be polite
when you ask someone for help.

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:49.107
Well, here's to the Green Room Boys.
Thank you very much.

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:52.544
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:53.778
-Thank you.
-Take care.

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:55.380
See you.

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:56.781
Thank you very much.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:17.602
I think they're a bit different from
the people I would usually call friends.

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:22.173
I can tell them what I think
without filters.

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:29.381
I found friends
I can truly be honest with.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:35.320
I learned a lot from all of them,

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:39.224
and I am also very determined now.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:44.095
I hope we'll meet soon.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.605
Thank you, Taeheon.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:57.442
As adults, we don't often
cry so much in front of everyone.

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:58.610
We really don't.

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.078
We're going to miss them.

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:02.580
-Can't bear seeing them off one by one.
-No.

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:04.883
I'm going to be like, "Wait a minute."

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.391
It's time for me to leave too.

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:21.132
I joined you all later on.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:27.505
So I may have been trying to act cool
and trying too hard.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:34.379
But gradually, I was able to open up
because you all did.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:39.784
I asked you for help,
and you helped me with my weaknesses.

00:28:40.618 --> 00:28:45.657
My time spent here
made me think about many things.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:50.462
The one thing I sincerely wanted
to make an effort with here

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:52.397
was romance.

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.400
Expressing my raw feelings.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:01.940
I did all I could for romance here,

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:05.376
which I think will give me
more confidence in the future.

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:11.049
Even after I leave here,
I'll keep up the soul-searching…

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:15.186
and continue doing my best.

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.055
Thank you very much.

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.623
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.958
Let's do our best.

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.292
We'll do our best.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.394
All right.

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.065
Ikuo.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:31.870
Thank you.

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.073
Thank you.

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.041
See you.

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:40.845
Let's do our best.

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.784
Take care.

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:49.487
-Thanks for taking my feelings seriously.
-Of course.

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.824
-Thank you, Ikuo.
-Thank you.

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:55.560
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.829
-Best of luck to both of us.
-Yes.

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:02.934
This is tough.

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.371
Well, thank you very much.

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:07.939
-Thank you, Ikuo.
-Thank you.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.141
-Thank you, Ikuo.
-Thank you.

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.443
-Watch your head…
-Ouch.

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:14.879
Are you okay?

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:19.651
-He was Ikuo until the end.
-Totally Ikuo.

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:35.099
This really changed
my outlook on my future.

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:39.137
Before I came here,
I just did what was required.

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:42.574
There was a part of me
I hadn't really explored.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.544
My life here has made me reconsider

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:53.284
my own happiness
and what I can do to live my best life.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.009
I'm going to leave next.

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:23.348
Before I go,
there's someone I want to talk to alone.

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:24.649
Okay.

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:28.286
I want to talk with Kazuto.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:29.220
Can we?

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.256
Thank you.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.424
-You'll come back, right?
-Soon.

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.326
That's good. We'll be waiting.

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.516
You know,

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:04.889
the other day, you told me
how you felt about me here.

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:08.493
At that time, I thought…

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:13.264
I was able to sort out my feelings.

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:18.169
I also thought
my romantic feelings for you

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:21.506
had calmed down for a bit.

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:29.180
But when you and Alan came back
from your second overnight date,

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:33.785
I found myself listening to your story
more attentively than Shun and Dai's.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:40.191
That must mean
I still had feelings for you.

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:41.592
I think.

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:46.264
So, yeah, I still…

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:51.736
have feelings for you.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:52.637
Yeah.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.240
If it's okay with you,

00:32:56.808 --> 00:33:02.947
it would make me happy
if we could leave the house together.

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.594
First, thank you
for telling me how you feel.

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:17.495
Yeah.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.431
When I met you…

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.302
in the beginning,

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:27.705
it was the coffee truck shift.

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:32.243
It was my first time.
I'd never worked with coffee before.

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:35.113
So you were the one who taught me a lot.

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:36.848
Yeah.

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:38.950
I appreciate you.

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:46.024
But after that day, you…

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:51.329
told me that you were interested in me.

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:56.801
And I started feeling awkward with you.

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:01.339
I was flattered,

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:04.008
but the fact I couldn't really handle it

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:08.246
was a reflection of my honest feelings.

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:10.848
So…

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:13.985
I…

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.261
I can't leave with you.

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:32.503
Thank you… for considering…
my feelings again.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:42.747
Thank you.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:43.648
Yeah.

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:46.818
See you.

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:47.885
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:51.155
In the end, you saved me.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.323
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:56.127
-Thank you, Alan.
-Thank you.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.765
You saved me too.

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.601
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:04.702
Next is Kazuto.

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:06.337
Thank you.

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:09.173
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.582
-Bye!
-See you.

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:19.550
-See you.
-Thank you.

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:23.254
Good luck.

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:50.314
I thought it was good

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:55.887
that I properly conveyed the feelings
that were important to me.

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:59.223
I learned the importance
of staying true to myself

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.059
and staying kind to everyone too.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:06.631
I want to value those kinds of things.

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:10.401
I'm leaving with no regrets.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.014
Ryota!

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.549
-He took a gamble.
-Yeah.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.551
His actions required a lot of courage

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:29.687
to confess to someone
you've already been rejected by.

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:30.855
Yes, I'm sure.

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:34.125
The fact that Ryota did
is a sign of his personal growth.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.259
Right.

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:40.364
Ryota is a reserved person,
but he's got an inner strength.

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:52.977
I

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.780
need to…

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.085
There's something… I want to tell Dai.

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:05.590
Can you come outside with me now?

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.058
Okay.

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:08.993
I see.

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:13.497
It's goodbye, then.

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:24.108
I'll miss your hugs.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.877
-We hugged every day.
-Yeah.

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.247
Thank you.

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.990
You were like my big brother.

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:40.725
-I'm glad we met.
-So am I.

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.626
Thank you.

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:44.862
-See you.
-Ciao.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:45.763
Ciao.

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.168
-Bye-bye.
-Take care.

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:59.010
Sorry. Thank you.

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:23.367
-Wow.
-Yeah.

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:29.307
Let's sit down.

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.576
It brings back memories.

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.047
-It feels nostalgic.
-Very much.

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.516
When I think back…

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:39.417
Yeah.

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:42.653
…I noticed you liked me

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.290
or that you had feelings for me,

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:49.994
but I wondered why
I was the one you were into.

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:53.597
Like, "What does he like about me?"

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.598
-About you?
-Yeah.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.235
Our first date?

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:00.938
I didn't enjoy it at all.

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.307
What? No way!

00:39:04.608 --> 00:39:06.677
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.347
-I see.
-And…

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:13.417
I didn't want to choose you
for the first sleepover date.

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.719
That's horrible.

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:21.325
I didn't want…
those off-putting feelings again.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.362
I hated the idea

00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:28.399
of agreeing just because you like me.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.404
-I said I wanted to just be friends.
-Yeah, you did.

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:34.638
I wanted to reset.

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.006
That's what you said.

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:40.544
Then I became interested.

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.146
-Despite everything?
-Yeah.

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:46.951
It made it easier for me

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:50.121
to accept… that you liked me.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.891
That your feelings weren't shallow.

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:56.994
Then I started to

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:02.933
behave like I did,
spoiled and seeking affection from you.

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:06.637
And we argued, didn't we?

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.272
Yeah, we did.

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:11.909
When I got cranky or sulked,

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:17.515
I was worried
maybe you wouldn't take me seriously.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.418
I doubted you at first.

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.821
But in our recent arguments…

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.526
you took me seriously.

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.864
I wasn't really sure until today

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.068
what our relationship would be
when this ended.

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:43.441
And so, in my mind…

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.251
I have strong feelings…
that I need to tell you about.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.595
Dai,

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.431
I'm in love with you.

00:41:21.378 --> 00:41:23.214
Shun, I'm in love with you too.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:26.884
Right now.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.404
-Wanna go?
-Yeah.

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:32.016
-It's so pretty.
-Yeah.

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.285
One more time.

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:45.796
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.365
I'll want to see you soon.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.101
I want to see you every day.

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:53.337
I want to, too, if it's possible.

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.238
Yeah.

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.342
That makes me happy.

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:01.111
Wow!

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:02.313
I'm so glad!

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.481
Shun is damn good.

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:06.850
-Yeah, that Shun!
-Shun is amazing!

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.619
He scores when it's needed.

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:11.088
He scored an incredible goal.

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:15.125
He was like a spoiled kid,
whining and sulking,

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:18.662
so for him to finish
by saying he's in love…

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.031
His words carry quite a punch.

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:24.802
In a way, we were jerked around by Shun

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:26.770
until he finally made us cry.

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:29.139
-Yes, and we ended up loving him.
-Exactly.

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.408
We're all adults now,

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:34.778
but there must be
many youngsters like Shun,

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.113
who try to test…

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.247
Yes, out of insecurity.

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:39.583
They may be confident about themselves,

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.354
but they worry whether
others will accept them.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.123
-We all have that part of us.
-We do!

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.926
Like, "Are you really sure?
Do you really like me?"

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.595
We'd actually love to get confirmation.

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.864
But we humans are scared, after all.

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:56.934
Scared of coming out of our shells
or trusting others.

00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:01.772
But if we open our hearts,
our feelings may get hurt,

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.274
but I think
something good will come from it.

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:05.509
That's true.

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:08.912
I have something to talk to you about.

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.388
Go ahead.

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:18.355
Come on.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.396
The relationship between us…

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:32.136
started when we went
on our overnight date.

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:34.238
Then we went on a picnic.

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:37.241
And we went glamping the other day.

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:44.448
Our feelings didn't always align,

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.851
but the distance between us,

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:50.487
compared to the beginning,

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:54.258
was already much closer in my mind.

00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:03.200
But unlike you, I'm not good
at expressing my feelings

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:08.439
or my excitement
since I don't talk much to begin with.

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.574
So maybe

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.477
I might make you feel insecure

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:18.782
or disappoint you at times.

00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:26.523
But your presence
has been very special to me.

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:33.430
I don't think I want that to end here.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:36.800
Okay.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:39.136
Yeah.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.107
I want to get to know you…

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:46.577
little by little…

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:54.551
by going to many places
and creating memories together.

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.823
If you'd like…

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.928
I want to leave here with you.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.270
Of course we will.

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.041
We'll definitely leave together.

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.109
All right.

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:21.311
Until the very end,

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.580
I've…

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:28.652
thought about you a lot,

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:32.189
and I still think about you, of course.

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:35.459
But during our stay here…

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.296
in this house,

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:44.067
the time I got to spend with you here

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.771
is something very different in my mind

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:52.109
from the time I spent with everyone else.

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:56.246
I want to be by your side.

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.482
I really do.

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.318
I want to get to know you more.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.023
If we spend more time together,

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.661
and what you're experiencing

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:15.132
connects with what I'm experiencing,

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:22.439
I want to be by your side
and really care for you.

00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:30.981
I just want to keep watching you cook.

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.253
Everyone left.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.187
Yeah.

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.490
But if we leave together,

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.460
we won't feel lonely, right?

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.268
How cute are you? Seriously.

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:56.473
Ready?

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.275
Say cheese.

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.179
Can you take one from that side?

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.147
Okay?

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:10.187
Say cheese.

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.328
I'll take this one. You take that one.

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:39.903
That was great!

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.004
It was wonderful!

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.773
It was epic!

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.508
Bravo! Seriously.

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:47.010
-It was splendid.
-So great.

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:50.313
Kazuto and Alan's story was so good.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.948
They're a perfect match!

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.084
-They're so cute!
-It's amazing.

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:58.388
It seems like they'd have opposite pacing
when it comes to love.

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:01.091
Alan would shoot forward
like, "I love you!"

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:03.593
Kazuto's pace is much slower.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.396
It's funny that they got together.

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:11.301
The emotional state of the receiver,
how it's conveyed,

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.970
the timing, and level of intensity…

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:17.374
All of it has to fit to work.

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:20.377
-It's a miracle.
-Truly a miracle, isn't it?

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:21.645
Yes, a miracle.

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.246
-I thought so too.
-Right?

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.582
This was a reality dating show,

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:29.486
but it was also about
each member's personal growth.

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.955
I'm happy we got to witness it.

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:34.324
And the title The Boyfriend

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:38.962
could imply a romantic partner,
but also literally a friend who's a boy.

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:42.599
Both were beautifully present.

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:48.138
Of course, the nastier aspects
could be entertaining on a dating show,

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:51.475
but their stories were really beautiful.

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.944
They expressed their feelings,
and when they got hurt,

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:57.147
someone who understood gave them solace.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.649
It was an example of how we should live.

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.884
Exactly!

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.219
-Totally!
-It was so deep.

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:04.921
I was able to learn a lot from them.

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:07.958
I felt like my heart
was continually cleansed.

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:13.196
They showed us what it fundamentally means
to care about someone.

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:14.965
It made me want to be in love.

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.600
I really want some romance!

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.135
Me too!

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:20.103
Oh, I've lived a life full of lies.

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:22.205
It's not too late.

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:23.473
You're still okay.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.775
Once you leave this studio,
it's a new life.

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.644
-I see.
-Life starts anew. Don't worry.

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.846
-A reentry.
-Can I still get my life back?

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.615
Can I reenter society?
