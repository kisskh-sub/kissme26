WEBVTT

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.017
This might be
the happiest time of my life.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.254
But honestly, who do you like right now?

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.826
My feelings got even stronger,
and I kind of got anxious.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.430
ANYONE CAN FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:36.369
I don't think
my family will accept my sexuality.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.707
I won't be able to give him grandkids.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.578
I want to be with you
and help you figure things out.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.550
TIME TO FACE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOURSELF

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.555
You should go all out
and put yourself out there.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.857
I almost kissed him a few times, you know.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:02.829
Our hands touched, right?
That feeling kind of stayed with me.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:09.069
Will you be my… first boyfriend?

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:13.606
THE WINTER WE LAUGHED,
CRIED, AND FELL IN LOVE

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.710
- "Think easy," she said
- She said

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.446
"Forever young and so wild"

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.516
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.919
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:05.425
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:09.162
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.763
Maybe

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.600
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.034
We're blind, blind

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.470
- Blind
- How'd we get air all this time?

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.739
- This time
- These things

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.142
- These things
- I never thought when you were mine

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.944
We used to break it together

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.913
Oh, oh, oh

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.849
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:30.984
CURRENT TEMPERATURE

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.087
Are we growing older together?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.788
Oh, oh, oh

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:40.360
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.296
We used to break it together

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.165
Oh, oh, oh

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:49.335
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.472
Are we growing older together?

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.407
Oh, oh, oh

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:58.978
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming about

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.248
When we were dazed and confused

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:17.864
Excuse me?

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:38.785
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.553
I'm so nervous.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.437
Ooh!

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.306
Ah!

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.408
- Ah, so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.476
I'm Jobu.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.345
- I'm… I'm Bomi. Yeah.
- Bomi?

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.580
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you too.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.548
Let's sit.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.953
- It's kind of awkward, just the two of us.
- So awkward, isn't it?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.589
- What to talk about?
- I don't know.

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.025
Where are you from?

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.627
- I'm from Tokyo.
- Oh, Tokyo.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.195
- And you?
- I'm from Osaka.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.130
Osaka. Then Kansai dialect.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.633
- Your Japanese sounds standard.
- Kansai. It hasn't come out yet.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.334
It'll come out
once I get more comfortable.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.637
- I went to university in Kyoto.
- Oh, I see. Well, then…

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:31.738
So I can fake it.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.172
- Fake?
- I can totally pull it off.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.875
- Okay, so later…
- Later on… call me out if I mess up.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.978
- Okay, I'll correct you if you're off.
- Yeah, please correct me.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.665
What a surprise!

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.034
Surprise! Hello.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.569
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you! I'm Izaya.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.872
- I'm Bomi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:06.839
IT SALES WORKER

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.841
- Nice to meet you… again!
- Well, not really!

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.610
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.079
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. Like, three years?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.548
- Three, or two maybe?
- You two know each other?

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:16.983
We do.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.485
- Whoa.
- A friend of a friend.

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.688
- I see.
- Yeah, a friend of a friend.

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.890
- What a surprise.
- What a surprise.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.992
No way. Wait, what about Australia?

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.094
- I came back.
- You came from Australia?

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.495
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.498
- Yeah, I live in Australia.
- Your English must be really good.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.934
- No, Just a little.
- Only a little?

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.169
Just a little.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:46.713
Hello?

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.815
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.387
We all stood up!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.589
{\an8}My name is Hiroya. Nice to meet you.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.024
{\an8}Nice to meet you.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.560
{\an8}- What did you do with your jackets?
- Put it wherever.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.894
{\an8}- Wherever?
- Wherever.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:05.231
{\an8}- Please sit wherever you like.
- Well, then, I'll just sit over here.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.834
Actually, I'm from Hokkaido.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.402
- Oh, is that so?
- I see.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.971
Yeah. I'm from Sapporo,
so I'm not too familiar with this area.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.408
- But I live and work in Tokyo now.
- Oh, got it.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.243
- Something like that.
- I see.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.380
Do you cook?
There are a lot of… cooking tools.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.215
Cooking, huh?

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.684
- Are you good at cooking?
- I don't cook.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.919
- You eat out?
- Uh-huh, I always end up eating out.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.254
Got it.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.331
That's true.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:42.402
Also, the lighting makes it hard
to see faces from here, right?

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.437
- I could see.
- I couldn't see at all.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.509
No way.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.880
{\an8}- Nice to meet you. I'm William.
- Nice to meet you.

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:57.383
{\an8}IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.752
{\an8}- Is it okay if I sit here?
- Go ahead.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.688
- It's been a while.
- Yeah, long time.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.657
No way. Wait, what's going on?

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:06.759
- So many reunions.
- Weren't you in Australia?

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.795
I came back from Australia for a bit.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.696
You came back?
I came back from Barcelona too.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:11.697
- You did?
- Yeah.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.400
- Barcelona? That's wild.
- So international.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.402
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:33.453
- Oh, someone new.
- Nice to meet you.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.954
{\an8}TELECOM SALES WORKER

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.990
{\an8}Nice to meet you.
I'm Kazuyuki. Nice to meet you.

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.625
{\an8}Nice to meet you too.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.461
Where are you from?

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.529
- Osaka.
- Oh, Osaka.

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.364
- I'm from Osaka too.
- Oh, I see.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.133
- I live in Kansai now.
- Nice.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.335
So my Kansai dialect is pretty strong.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.503
- Mmm.
- Oh!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.171
Wow.

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.340
You have a bold hairstyle.

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.910
I'm embarrassed.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.926
{\an8}Hi. I'm Huwei. Nice to meet you.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.394
{\an8}GRADUATE STUDENT

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.563
{\an8}- Nice to meet you.
- So everyone stands up, huh?

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:21.100
I think I'll sit here.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.203
- Good to have you.
- Huwei-kun.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.272
- I know him.
- Oh, you do?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.975
We once… Anyway, I'm Bomi.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.110
- Yep.
- It's great to have you.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.778
- They know each other.
- Where from?

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:36.115
Well… I'm actually from Thailand.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.351
- Wow. Cool.
- Oh, really?

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.720
I mean… your T-shirt is Thai. Very Thai.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.622
- Yeah, Thai pride.
- Repping Thailand?

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:43.723
Repping.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.128
- Something is ringing.
- Me?

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:52.031
- You're the first one here.
- Right, I'll get it then. Here we go.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.637
{\an8}"Welcome to the Green Room."

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:01.774
{\an8}"You'll all be living together here
for two months."

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:05.645
{\an8}"Green Room is a surfing term."

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.147
{\an8}"The Green Room refers to the sacred space

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.684
{\an8}inside the shimmering
green barrel of a wave."

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.589
{\an8}"We hope you will find
irreplaceable partners and friends

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.624
{\an8}over the next two months,

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.694
{\an8}and that you will have
a brilliant spring."

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.462
{\an8}"Welcome."

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.066
- It's started.
- Yes.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.234
It sure has.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.936
Let's do this!

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.006
It's finally begun.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.708
{\an8}- The Boyfriend season two!
- Let's go!

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:38.477
{\an8}YOSHIMI TOKUI, CHIAKI HORAN, MEGUMI,
THELMA AOYAMA, DURIAN LOLLOBRIGIDA

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.913
- We've been waiting so long!
- Absolutely!

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.717
In this season, they will be
living together for two whole months.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.852
- Two months!
- In Hokkaido in winter.

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:51.591
This is a story of love and friendship
taking place around a coffee truck

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:56.195
and the Green Room, where they will
spend a limited amount of time together.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.464
Even if they fall in love
and end it in the first month,

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.600
they'll have time
to start something new next month.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.668
- That could happen.
- Yes, it could.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.705
And there are some qualities
you can only come to see

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.107
after spending a lot of time
with someone, right?

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.208
Yeah, right.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.478
There are qualities you only see
after spending a long time with someone,

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.915
{\an8}and I think there are some things that can
only sprout because you have two months.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.617
{\an8}Is there anyone who caught your interest?

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.685
{\an8}All the participants this time
are so handsome!

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:20.586
{\an8}- Right?
- Yes.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:24.357
{\an8}- Many people with a global mindset.
- Many with global backgrounds.

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:27.560
{\an8}William, for example,
just got back from Barcelona,

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.763
{\an8}and he seems like someone
who's been flying all over the place.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.734
{\an8}So I think he might be someone with
new values and a broad perspective.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:38.170
{\an8}For me, since
we're around the same age, it's Kazuyuki.

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.305
{\an8}I get it.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.474
I think it takes a lot of courage

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.443
to jump into a place like this
at this age.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.547
{\an8}I'm a bit curious to see
how his determination to jump in here

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.583
{\an8}will develop over the next two months.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.585
{\an8}- Yeah.
- What about you, Thelma?

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:56.022
{\an8}So, Bomi said,
when Huwei entered the Green Room,

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.124
{\an8}he said, "Um… Oh, we once…"

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.726
{\an8}- He did say that!
- He did.

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.962
I was like, "What did he mean by 'once'?"

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.397
That made me curious.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:06.432
But there were people
who already knew each other.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.835
{\an8}- There were quite a few of them.
- Durian mentioned it's a small world.

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.438
{\an8}Yeah, things like
you've been drinking at the same bar.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.673
{\an8}Or you met at the same club.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.175
{\an8}Things like that happen all the time.

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:20.312
{\an8}I think we'll find out from here
what kind of acquaintances they are.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.148
{\an8}True. I wonder how they know each other.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.916
{\an8}- It could be good or bad.
- Good or bad!

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.584
{\an8}What did he mean by "once"?

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:28.287
{\an8}- Right?
- I'm so curious.

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.357
- We're having steak.
- Awesome.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.993
- This is amazing.
- For this many people.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.995
I've never cooked for this many people.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.897
- I can't guess the portions.
- No idea.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.032
- We don't need that many mushrooms.
- We don't?

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.834
- I don't think so.
- Nearly overdid it!

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.036
- A crazy amount.
- We seriously love mushrooms.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:46.038
- It'll be delicious.
- A crazy amount of mushrooms.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.013
This is good enough, right?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.114
Looks good, right?

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.916
- Is it? Is it enough?
- Yeah.

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.118
The way you grill meat
shows your personality.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:01.587
- It'll keep cooking. Residual heat.
- It's super rare.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:02.621
True.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.125
No, I don't think we can eat this at all!

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.461
It's super rare. Super rare!

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:12.531
- No way we can eat this.
- It's almost raw. Raw meat.

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:13.933
But, I mean…

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.936
- Our first day.
- To our first day.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.637
Cheers!

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.039
Awesome.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:23.375
- Why did we apply? Let's talk about why.
- Why we came.

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:24.844
Why we came to the Green Room.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.715
Well… I was in a relationship
for 15 years until last year.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.584
- Mmm.
- Aah. That's a long time.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.219
But when I reached this age,

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:36.622
I was wondering if things
were going to stay the same forever.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:40.359
So I wanted to be alone for a while
and think things over, right?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.129
I thought if I had
an opportunity like this,

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.098
I might be able to express
my true feelings.

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.967
That's kind of why I applied.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.703
I do worry that people are going to say,

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:54.473
{\an8}"I can't believe
you went on this show at 40."

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.343
{\an8}But I wanna be able
to express my honest feelings,

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:01.347
{\an8}connect with someone,
and go home together with someone.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:05.584
{\an8}That's my… yeah, ideal scenario.

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:10.756
Actually, um…
I also had a partner a while ago.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:14.226
Well, we broke up
about two or three years ago.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:18.864
There's a part of me that feels like I'm
forgetting how to be in a relationship.

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.734
- There's that.
- I need this kind of opportunity.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.803
To take a new step forward.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.871
I think. Yeah.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.909
{\an8}I want to be with someone
who has similar values

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.745
{\an8}and sensibilities as me.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:37.883
{\an8}I believe a real partner is someone with
whom you can envision a future together.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:42.421
{\an8}That's the kind of person I want to meet
and fall in love with. I feel that deeply.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:48.861
You never know
when someone dear to you might die.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:54.099
So if I meet someone like that,
I want to tell them how I feel.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.403
Izaya seems to have it fairly together,

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.039
but I think he's got
a fragile side to him too.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.540
You figured that out just from that?

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.976
- Yeah.
- Of course you did! So impressive.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:09.048
For me, I was really moved
when I watched season one of this show.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.684
I felt that everyone placed
a lot of importance

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.919
on their relationships with people.

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:19.024
I realized that that's something
I've always put second to work until now.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:25.030
{\an8}My job is an architect,
and I work in the design industry.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:28.500
{\an8}I've always liked and been good at
making things since I was a kid.

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:32.037
{\an8}I use a 3D printer
to create stuff like vases.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:35.374
{\an8}I immediately start making
whatever I picture in my head.

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:40.980
I've been… neglecting things
like socializing until now,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.816
so I want to take the time

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:46.318
to engage with different people.

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:49.788
This society sucks, doesn't it?

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.157
I don't want to give in.

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.693
Oh, I wonder what happens.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.063
- Not just romance, but a lot of things.
- Exactly!

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.499
Yeah, I could see him
making something scary

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.201
with a 3D printer when under pressure.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.038
- The cucumbers were spicy, huh?
- Why?

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.339
The peppers are spicy--

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.209
- Hey! Fireworks!
- Oh, wow. Pretty.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.510
No way.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:13.078
- Wow.
- I wanna go see.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.613
No way. Really?

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.116
- Wait! Short sleeves.
- Too sudden!

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.317
So sudden!

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.026
- Crazy!
- They're really going off.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.594
Isn't it amazing?

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.796
Wait, you saw them
in that direction, right?

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.832
- So pretty.
- Wow! So pretty,

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:39.271
Colors in you, colors in me

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:42.641
Colors in everybody

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:46.612
- Colors in you, colors in me
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.681
Colors in everybody

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:51.250
I never thought
I'd get to see fireworks in winter.

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.052
Round and around and around

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:55.654
- And around
- So cool.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.656
Oh

00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:02.394
Round and around and around and around

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.563
Oh

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.534
Colors in you, colors in me

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.304
Colors in everybody

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:16.108
Colors in you, colors in me

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:19.011
Colors in everything

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:21.714
Some of them have already
fallen for someone at first sight.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.850
It looks like it. They must've
felt, "Oh, this person's cute."

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.019
- You think so?
- Glancing to the side!

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.921
"I like your face watching fireworks."

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.256
- Not looking at the fireworks!
- Exactly!

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.791
They're looking at you!

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.597
Time for some fruit for dessert.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.699
- Fruit duty.
- Dessert duty.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.436
It's hard to cut mangoes, huh?

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.473
- What?
- No, nothing.

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.241
- Is this right?
- Huh?

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:52.711
- Is this the right way?
- Don't know. I don't know the correct way.

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.647
But I'm cutting it so it's easy to eat.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.050
There must be lots of fruits in Australia.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.651
Yeah, there's a lot.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.788
I wish I could've gone to Australia.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.523
You can still come.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.959
- It's summer now, right?
- Yeah, summer now.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.661
William, you do that… You surf, right?

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.296
- Huh?
- You like surfing, right?

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:15.934
Oh, yeah. I mean, I used to surf in Tokyo.
But there are no waves in Barcelona.

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:18.871
Oh, really? Australia is famous
for surfing, you know.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.906
Yeah, I know. That's why I want to go.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.877
{\an8}I moved to Barcelona
about three years ago.

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.613
{\an8}My dad… my dad is from Peru,

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.917
{\an8}so I think Latin culture is kind of

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.153
{\an8}ingrained in me somewhere.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:39.691
{\an8}So I decided to relocate there
partly to explore my roots.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:44.430
- Can't wait for snowboarding.
- Yeah.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.565
- Right?
- And hot springs after snowboarding.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.101
Ah, the best. An outdoor hot spring.

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.771
Before we get too deep
into conversation, I have souvenirs.

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:55.707
- What do you mean?
- I had a ton of business trips.

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:59.178
- Dubai?
- Yeah. I went to Abu Dhabi.

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:00.612
- Wow.
- Nice!

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.981
- This is Dubai's…
- Dubai chocolate?

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.383
- Whoa!
- From the UAE.

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:07.953
- Looks delicious. Yay! Thank you!
- Yay! Thank you.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.255
- I'm glad we have a fun group.
- Totally.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.858
- For real.
- Truly glad.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.095
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:18.831
- Should I check it?
- Yes, please.

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:23.669
{\an8}"Your day in the Green Room
is coming to an end."

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:27.606
{\an8}"Tonight, as you reflect on the day,

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:32.211
{\an8}write a letter
to just one of the participants."

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.514
{\an8}"However, do not sign your name."

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.286
{\an8}"Drop your letter
in the recipient's mailbox

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.288
{\an8}by the end of tonight."

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.992
{\an8}"Check your mailbox tomorrow morning."

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:51.563
{\an8}"May your feelings reach the recipient."

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:57.769
- Here it is.
- It was so sudden.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.272
- They have someone in mind.
- Definitely.

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:03.342
Of course they do.
They're here to fall in love.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.712
I wonder if someone's love
is undercooked too.

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:09.748
- Oh, stop it!
- That's funny, I like it.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.550
- This is fun.
- Oh!

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.586
- It's such a cute place.
- Yeah, the rooms are nice too.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.823
Seize the day, yeah
We're bouncin' back into it

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.725
There's a way, yeah

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.193
What should I write?

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.661
What d'you say

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.497
{\an8}Honestly, I thought he was handsome.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.533
{\an8}And I really like the way he talks.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:30.169
{\an8}He picks fun words here and there.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.571
There's a way…

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:35.774
{\an8}There's no way I'll get any.
There is no way.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.843
- Don't say that.
- I don't think I'm popular.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.279
{\an8}What the heck is he talking about?

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:43.782
- Hiroya needs some confidence.
- Yeah.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.217
Feelin' so good

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:50.589
{\an8}I moved away from home to study
and went to the University of Tokyo.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:54.560
I'm short, so I can't help
but find tall people attractive.

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.628
I'm often drawn to people
who have what I don't.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.797
{\an8}That grown man calm, that dandy vibe.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.933
- Okay, he must be really smart.
- Yep.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.635
I wonder if he's
the type to really go for it.

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:07.005
{\an8}I've never dated a man before.

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:11.176
{\an8}- What? Oh, really?
- So I'm here to find my first boyfriend.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.111
{\an8}Really? That's amazing.

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:16.915
{\an8}Well, since this would be
my first boyfriend, I want something pure.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:22.888
{\an8}Like the kind of romance where we can buy
one ice cream and enjoy sharing it.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:26.191
- Yeah.
- His first love!

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:29.194
But first loves tend
to raise the bar quite a bit.

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.829
Yeah, that's true.

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.947
Maybe no letters, huh?

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.283
For Bomi.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:54.152
- But it's only day one.
- Yeah, that's right.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:00.692
- He's the youngest of all.
- Oh, that's right.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.961
- He's among the big brothers.
- He's 23.

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.299
{\an8}- The big brother.
- Our big brother.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.835
{\an8}- Kazuyuki.
- He took a leap of faith and joined.

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.204
Ah, big brother…

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.491
Oh! There it is!

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:41.667
I'm glad there was at least one letter.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.604
The person I thought
looked handsome was William.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.240
So I'd be happy if this were from him.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.976
But it's probably from Kazuyuki.

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.978
It says, "We're older,"
and he's the oldest.

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.680
{\an8}I WANT TO SEE MORE OF YOUR POSITIVE SIDE!

00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:56.381
DON'T MIND YOUR MANNERS WITH YOUR ELDERS!

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.327
- Whoa, two letters!
- Impressive.

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.596
From Izaya?

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.298
What? From who?

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.705
I'm happy to get two letters.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.108
This last part.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.410
It says, "I thought you looked handsome
at first glance."

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:27.813
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR DAY ONE! THERE'S
SO MUCH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT!

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:28.980
{\an8}That's the first impression.

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.049
{\an8}I NOTICED HOW HANDSOME YOU ARE
AT FIRST GLANCE

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.552
{\an8}Looking at this, I thought it was nice

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.221
that this person
was honest about his feelings.

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.791
{\an8}I hope I got a letter from
the person I wrote to.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:42.794
{\an8}I THOUGHT YOU WERE FLASHY, BUT
HEARING YOU TALK CHANGED MY IMPRESSION.

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.963
But I don't think I did!

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.299
Just judging by the letter,
doesn't feel like it.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.249
- Well, it's only the first day.
- Right.

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:06.651
- They don't know anything yet.
- Exactly.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.399
- Whoa!
- Whoa! All eyes are on him!

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.701
- Impressive.
- Wow, amazing. Izaya!

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:25.303
Izaya's popular, huh? Wow.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.941
- But his reaction is so chill.
- Right?

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:32.878
- He doesn't go, "Yay!"
- I'd be overjoyed.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:41.386
{\an8}IT WAS A HECTIC DAY, WASN'T IT?
LET'S ENJOY THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.454
Bomi.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.592
{\an8}DEAR IZAYA, THANKS FOR TODAY.
YOU HAVE A LOVELY SMILE.

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:50.061
{\an8}- "You have a lovely smile."
- William!

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.730
{\an8}LET'S ENJOY THE NEXT TWO MONTHS!

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.266
{\an8}DEAR IZAYA, I LOVE HOW YOU TALK
AND THE WORDS YOU USE!

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:56.268
{\an8}The final letter genuinely made me happy.

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.470
{\an8}I HOPE WE GET TO TALK MORE.
LET'S MAKE LOTS OF MEMORIES!

00:23:58.537 --> 00:23:59.571
{\an8}From Huwei.

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:02.274
{\an8}He said he really likes
the way I talk, and my word choice.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.444
I guess it feels like
he's seeing who I am inside.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.480
That's the impression I got
from this letter.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.915
This, like…

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:12.350
The smiley face he drew.

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.487
This kind of feels like from Huwei.

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.289
Wow.

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:18.990
- He knows.
- He can tell.

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:24.095
I kinda get the feeling
that Izaya has inner strength.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:29.835
He said he wouldn't get any letters, but…

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.705
- He got a letter! I'm glad.
- He got one!

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:36.174
I'm so relieved. Hm? But who's it from?

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:40.178
- Mmm, he looks happy.
- Yeah, he looks happy.

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:46.585
I was relieved to get a letter. I'm happy.

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:47.986
I'm happy for him.

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:50.155
Is this really
just a thank you for the gift?

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:52.691
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR THE DELICIOUS GIFT.
IT WAS DELICIOUS. BEST WISHES.

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:54.426
Maybe he had no one else to write to.

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:57.329
Maybe he wrote to me because my souvenir

00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.631
was the only thing
that left an impression.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:02.234
I hope that's not the case.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.070
- Don't say things like that.
- Yeah, too negative.

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:08.807
- There's always one person like that.
- Yeah, like, "I'm not good enough."

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.408
{\an8}- Cute.
- No mutual crushes.

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:12.577
{\an8}With this many people,
and no mutual feelings.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.513
{\an8}- Right.
- You're right. No matches yet.

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:18.750
{\an8}Even though they're writing
these letters on the first day,

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.519
{\an8}but they're pretty important, right?

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.953
{\an8}- First impressions.
- True.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.288
{\an8}It means "You're my type."

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.790
{\an8}And once you write a letter
to a specific person,

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.225
{\an8}you start thinking about them more.

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:29.861
{\an8}That's true.
Writing makes you aware of your feelings.

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.764
Huh? Are you cooking?

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.501
What are you making?

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:39.304
I wanted to marinate some eggs,
after boiling them.

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.206
- Eggs?
- Like ramen eggs.

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:43.408
- Oh, nice.
- So we can eat tomorrow.

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:44.809
Ah, that sounds good.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.412
Day two, marinating eggs!

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.314
It's a "marinating boiled eggs"
kinda morning.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:54.152
Hey, Huwei, have you ever
worked part-time somewhere?

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.488
- I was an airport interpreter.
- What?

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.523
I did some interpreting
in Chinese and English.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.926
Oh, wait. You speak English too?

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:03.295
- I'm not a native speaker at all, but…
- That's so cool.

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:06.097
Huwei, how long
did you live in China again?

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.967
Until I was seven… Seven? Yeah.

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:12.370
- So you moved here when you were seven?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:15.907
{\an8}At the moment, I'm studying two things,

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:18.610
{\an8}gender theory and anthropology,
in graduate school.

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:23.181
{\an8}It's not like I set out to specialize
in the gender studies area,

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:27.152
{\an8}but as I got into my research
and did a lot of reading,

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:31.423
{\an8}I learned that this is a society
where people like us can live,

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.425
{\an8}and I found that really fascinating.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:37.596
{\an8}So I want more people
to learn about this as well,

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:42.367
and let them know that they too
can live authentically, as themselves.

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.970
- Let's eat.
- Let's dig in.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.838
Why am I always the one to say that?

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.107
We should assign someone to say that.

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.575
- Meal captain.
- Meal captain.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:52.077
Mmm, it's good.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.646
Let's eat. I'm glad.

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:56.615
So good I forget to talk.

00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:03.722
Oh, right. So today, I'm actually supposed
to get some important news,

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:08.593
and I thought I might as well open it
in front of you all.

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:10.462
Important news?

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:13.531
Well, I've been in, um, graduate school,

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:17.369
um, working toward completing
my master's degree.

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.706
- Next, I'm planning a doctoral program.
- You're doing a PhD?

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:23.308
- Yeah, PhD.
- Wow.

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.244
And the results are announced today.

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.812
- Oh, my!
- You haven't checked?

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:29.581
- I haven't.
- In front of everyone?

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.816
I've been wondering about how it went.

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:33.318
I've just been thinking about it.

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:36.154
- That's nerve-wracking.
- Yeah, so I thought I'd check now.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:37.288
- Is it posted already?
- Now?

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.257
- Here?
- Can you see it already?

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:42.761
It's 312203.

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:45.096
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't tap yet!

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:46.631
DOCTORAL PROGRAM ENTRANCE EXAM RESULTS

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.099
Will it show up right away?

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.234
- Hey.
- Wait.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.769
- Seriously?
- See it?

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.171
- What?
- 31…

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:56.941
- What number?
- 2203! There it is!

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.577
Thank goodness!

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:00.612
Congratulations!

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:02.747
- I'm so happy for you!
- Amazing!

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.916
- So happy.
- Thank goodness.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.251
So nerve-wracking.

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:09.421
- I'm so relieved. Thank you.
- Congratulations!

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.289
Today's an unforgettable day.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.058
So impressive!

00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:14.025
So what is Huwei doing?

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:16.628
I don't even understand.
What exactly is he doing?

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.297
There's university,
and then you go to graduate school

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.899
to earn a master's degree, right?

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.467
After that, there's the PhD.

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.903
Is it like the school above grad school?

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:26.471
It's still grad school.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.574
The degree you get depends on
how many years you spend there.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.543
Wait a minute.
Now it feels like I sound dumb.

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:32.711
Ugh!

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:36.114
Please cut this part from my question!

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.150
- Hey.
- This way, right?

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:42.754
- Oh, look. The mountain is so beautiful.
- Wow.

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.689
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.091
Gorgeous.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.860
Are we on the lake already?

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.896
- We're on it.
- Are we on the lake?

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:55.200
- Wow, it's frozen, huh?
- This is the best.

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.504
- What's this? Is this it?
- Banana boats?

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.806
- Are you serious?
- Are we doing this?

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.842
It'll definitely hurt
if you fall from this.

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.977
We have to be
careful not to hit our heads.

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.713
Helmets! Is everyone
choosing your favorite color?

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.482
Yeah. Something suits me.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.450
I want a white one, but…

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:14.619
It'll be funny if you put this on.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.288
I wonder what this is.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:19.824
- So tiny, isn't it!
- Oh, this is bad.

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:20.925
Isn't it weird?

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:23.294
This thing…
It's definitely better with this, right?

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:24.996
Yeah, it's better to have it.

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:27.532
- It's better to have it.
- No, let's go with this.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.201
- But it doesn't have this part.
- Yeah, it's better.

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:32.203
It's better to have it, right?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.938
Let me just take a picture.

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:37.108
- Awesome, awesome.
- Your face looks goofy.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:38.843
I like how he looks like a panda.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.946
- Cute.
- Adorable! Huwei is so cute!

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:45.183
Funny thing with helmets, there's always
one person who doesn't look good in it.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.284
Helmets, right.

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:50.588
This is tricky.

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.264
- Thrilling!
- They're going for it.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.932
- Amazing!
- So pretty.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.467
It must feel so good.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:06.037
- It's pretty fast.
- This is so fun!

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:08.940
Feels great!

00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:12.544
Beautiful.

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:15.780
Hey, I wanna go to Lake Akan!

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:20.351
- I wanna do this!
- What on Earth? It looks so fun!

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.722
Wow, looks so fun. Such a release!

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:27.725
Who wants to ride a snowmobile?
So, everyone?

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.294
Shall we? Let's do it.

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:32.163
- Go for it.
- We're off!

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.498
Who wants to do what?

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:36.367
- You can sit in the front.
- Huh? Are you sure? Yay.

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.404
- Here we go.
- Whoa! Wait, wait!

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.606
It's fast. It's pretty fast.

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:48.079
- So it's quite fast, huh?
- They're far gone already.

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:48.980
We lost 'em.

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.585
- Looks fun.
- So much fun.

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.086
They're going so fast.

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:57.522
Please don't break a bone
and have to leave the show.

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.924
- They're so wild.
- Looks like so much fun.

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.860
- Looks so fun.
- I wanna try.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.632
Was that max speed? Were you at max?

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.934
- No idea.
- It was crazy!

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:13.204
- That was great.
- I thought it was normal.

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:16.207
If you're going to hold on,
grab me under the arms.

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.243
Here we go!

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.451
- Nice. Hold tight, Hiroya.
- Nice!

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.387
They're totally different.
They're going so slowly.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.626
It's pretty tricky to go straight.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.464
Let's go. Let's go!

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:41.666
Is this max speed?

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.074
- Huh?
- Here it is.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.848
{\an8}"For the next two months,
you will be running a coffee truck."

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.716
{\an8}- Coffee truck.
- Here we go.

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:01.753
{\an8}"By running it together as a team,

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.155
{\an8}we hope you can grow closer."

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:07.592
{\an8}"You're free to use the profits
however you like."

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.796
{\an8}"First, decide on the name of the shop."

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.999
- It's happening.
- [Izaya[ It's starting.

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:18.937
So it's coffee, after all.

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:20.972
Okay, how about I handle the note-taking?

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.440
- Please.
- Please do.

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:23.675
That's so you.

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:29.213
- "Our Coffee."
- "Our Coffee."

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:33.918
- How about "Café de Nieve"?
- "Café de Nieve"?

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:37.055
It's kind of cute and stylish.
What does it mean?

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.590
- Snow, right?
- It means snow. Yeah, snow.

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:40.959
- "Snow Café."
- Nice.

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:44.462
- I kind of want to give it a warm feeling.
- Mmm.

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.631
How about naming it "Hot Coffee"?

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:48.333
"Hot Coffee."

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:51.035
Okay! It might be nice and simple.

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:53.705
Hot Coffee.
Oh, it might be cute in hiragana.

00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:55.106
- Hiragana?
- Sorry.

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.275
I see you're particular
about that. Excuse me.

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:01.913
Um, since many of us are from Kansai,
and we're close to Lake Akan…

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.915
- How about "Akan Coffee"?
- "Akan Coffee"!

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:05.283
I like that.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.453
- Like "Akan! Coffee."
- Is it safe to drink?

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:11.489
- People would…
- This is definitely trouble.

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.925
People would definitely ask,
"Why is it not okay?"

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:19.063
Since we all came from far away
by plane, how about "Journey"?

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:23.534
- Something along those lines.
- How about "Journey and Coffee"?

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.004
Something like this.
"Us, Journey, and Coffee."

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:30.641
That's new! Very nice.
I like it, I like it.

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.877
- Isn't this name cute?
- It's really good.

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:34.879
- It feels unique.
- It's cute.

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:36.347
- It's good.
- Good.

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.850
- Didn't think we'd get this far.
- Wonderful.

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:42.353
{\an8}US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:51.729
Jumping right in, let's form pairs
for drip coffee practice.

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:52.630
COFFEE WORKSHOP

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:54.365
MUSASHI KIHARA, BARISTA
HINANO KATO, BARISTA

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:57.168
And others for café lattes and latte art.
Pair up with whoever you like.

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.970
- Let's pair up.
- Okay.

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.738
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:03.041
- Okay.
- Okay. Which one should we do?

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.576
Either is fine. This one or…

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:09.614
- William was interested in Izaya.
- Yeah.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.115
- Nothing's changed.
- Right.

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:14.018
- That will make the foam lumpy.
- He's staring at his face.

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.421
- William stares a lot.
- He does!

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:20.858
- Hot! Is everything okay?
- I get it now. Sorry.

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:23.327
He's in a tank top,
so the steam's hitting him directly.

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.997
He needs to be careful.
He should put on a shirt.

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:27.799
I'm nervous.

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:30.134
I'd hate to do it in front of a customer.

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.302
Right?

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.770
I'd be super nervous.

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.406
Wow, it changes this much?

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:37.975
I thought coffee tasted the same
no matter who brewed it.

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:47.785
Apparently, the area around Lake Akan is
famous for the hot spring.

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:50.221
So I really wanna try going there.

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:54.058
- I wanna go in an outdoor hot spring.
- Right? Do you all like hot springs?

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.393
I go about once a week.

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:58.429
- You go every week?
- I go every week to hit the sauna.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.833
So if you all are okay with it,
I really want to go together.

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:03.701
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:04.869
We wanna go, right?

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:08.139
- Hot springs tomorrow, then.
- Hot springs in the morning, huh?

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:11.876
- I haven't heard the judo story.
- Right, right.

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.245
- Professional… You mentioned…
- He's the real deal.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:15.980
You were on the Thai national team?

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:19.884
Before I came here, um, there was
something like a selection match.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.719
- For the Thai national team.
- Cool.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.821
To decide
the national team for the Olympics.

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:26.924
- For Thailand?
- Yeah, there was a match, and so…

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.993
- For real?
- I won all the matches.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.531
So I'm back on the national team, and um,
I'm a designated national team athlete.

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:36.501
- Until the upcoming LA Olympics.
- Wait, you're going to the Olympics?

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.002
- A possibility?
- Possibility.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.303
- Crazy!
- Crazy!

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.305
I can't believe he excels
at academics and sports.

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:43.341
- He's even pursuing a PhD?
- National team?

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:46.644
- He's like the perfect human being.
- Yeah, he's amazing.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:49.514
I'd been aiming
for the Tokyo Olympics all along,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.083
but just before, I got a serious injury.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.753
So I missed Tokyo, and I couldn't make it
to the next one in Paris either.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.589
I tore my knee ligaments twice.

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:00.992
I was still an undergraduate at the time.

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:03.027
It was right
when I had to write my thesis.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:05.630
I had all this extra energy,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:08.132
So I put all my energy into my thesis,

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.535
and then I realized how fun research was.

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:12.803
And somehow, I ended up a grad student.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.173
You'll train for the Olympics
while getting a PhD?

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:17.909
- School and sports.
- Excelling everything!

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.010
So cool.

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:34.792
- His face…
- Looked out of it.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:35.860
He was gone.

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:41.799
Apparently, this pose helps you focus.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.736
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:47.772
- I feel refreshed.
- Me too.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:54.312
- You hitting the gym tomorrow?
- If I can wake up at 7:30.

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.013
- Will you?
- I will.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.315
- Okay.
- And…

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.484
Between Huwei and you,
you're the one unlikely to wake up.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.355
- I actually do wake up when it matters.
- Really?

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:06.324
Yeah. But if someone
doesn't wake up, call me.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.659
If someone doesn't wake up, call me.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.261
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:34.719
I'm embarrassed.

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:37.221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.924
Wasn't it 8:30? You… I mean, Izaya.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:44.395
Yeah. I was around from
about 6:30… No, 6:00. I couldn't sleep.

00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:46.230
That's rough.

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:48.766
Not getting any sleep is rough.

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:52.436
- Yeah, I haven't slept a minute.
- But we'll drink coffee again at training.

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.138
Yeah, seriously, it's rough.

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:59.510
Actually, I was doing some thinking, too.
That might be part of the reason.

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:01.979
About work? Or what? About this place?

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.315
- A lot of things.
- That's cryptic.

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.485
Here goes.

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.939
What a luxury
to have good coffee in the morning.

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:30.641
Cheers.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.077
It's got a nice color.

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:39.917
It's a bit strong.
We could dilute it with water.

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:42.019
Yeah, but it's still really good.

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:46.791
Well, then, shall we
go to the hot springs?

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:47.825
Shall we?

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:50.594
Do you… actually not like hot springs?

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.332
I thought maybe it was hard
for you to bring up.

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:56.033
- Oh, really?
- Are you okay?

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.967
Well…

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.339
- Um, can I be honest, then?
- Yeah.

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.740
I might not want to go.

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:05.009
Right. I thought so.

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:08.879
Yeah, I've been thinking about it…
since yesterday.

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.181
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.283
Let's not stress
over the little things, okay?

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.920
I couldn't say, "I'll pass,"
when everyone was excited for it.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:20.491
I didn't want to ruin the mood like that.
Because it was a really good mood.

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.360
- It won't ruin it.
- You think?

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:24.595
- You don't like hot springs, do you?
- No, I do like them.

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.464
- But with everyone…
- I just don't feel like it.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.498
Yeah, right.

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.467
You don't have to force yourself.

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:34.305
If you don't feel like going right now,
I'd be happy to stay back with you, Bomi.

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:35.506
Oh, are you sure?

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.377
- I feel bad.
- Don't be.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.480
- Let's hold down the fort.
- Yay.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:44.815
It's so sweet of him to notice.

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:48.419
It's nice to have someone
looking out for you like that.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.955
I'm so excited.

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.590
Um, hey…

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:57.228
Wait, I don't want to get awkward.
Can I stay home?

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:59.830
- Huh? What?
- Um, it's not like that. Um…

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:02.199
- Huh?
- It's only the third day and…

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:04.235
- Too soon?
- It's a little too soon.

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.804
Like, I, um, really do like, um,
hot springs.

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.706
So I really want to go.

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.408
I mean, I really want
to go to hot springs.

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.209
He's right. They have two months.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.111
Yeah, I'll go another time. Yeah.

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.447
Bomi said he wants to stay, so I will too.

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.648
- Oh? Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.017
- He said he would.
- I'm not in the mood for hot springs.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.987
- He's so sweet!
- So, that's how it is. I'm really sorry.

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.322
- Have fun. Another time.
- We'll have fun.

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:27.558
It's important to be able to say that.

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.059
- Enjoy the hot spring!
- Bye.

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.961
It's better not to let stress build up.

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:33.931
Way better for the people
who are going to go with a good feeling.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.136
Oh! It's a dream come true

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:41.005
Hold on, wait a minute.

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.339
I mean, look at them.

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.909
- I don't like it.
- Towels are riding pretty low.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.510
They're all something else!

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:48.979
- Oh my, oh my.
- So typical of The Boyfriend!

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:51.715
- Not everyone is this toned!
- It's insanely beautiful.

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.984
- Their bodies are amazing.
- So pretty.

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:55.052
Gorgeous.

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.760
This is fantastic.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:03.928
It feels great.

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.897
- This is awesome.
- This is the best.

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.899
- The view is crazy.
- It's not cold at all.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.375
- I want to be this tan.
- Do you tan?

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.144
I take an ice bath every morning in Spain.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.346
- You tan in an ice bath?
- Every morning?

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.449
- The sun is out when I take an ice bath.
- In the ice bath?

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.651
- When I get out…
- So you get tan from the sun.

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:31.255
- That's the best.
- I do this 15 to 30 minutes every day.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:32.957
So I never lose my tan.

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.360
I was thinking
that he has a gorgeous body.

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:39.563
And the color of William's skin…
I love it.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.299
Ah, the color was just great.
His skin tone was great.

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:45.536
William gives off… a sexy scent.

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:47.972
There's just something about him.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.574
A sensual vibe.

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:54.345
Do you want to get married?

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.413
Hmm…

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:59.650
- It depends.
- Depends on the person?

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:02.520
Mmm. I mean,
if the other person really wants to…

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:04.154
- You'd be okay with it?
- Mm-hm.

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:08.259
Like, before I left Japan,
I never thought about marriage.

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:11.095
But I started thinking about it
when I went to Spain.

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.264
There were a lot
of married couples around.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.765
- Same-sex marriage?
- Yeah.

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:17.234
These guys were calling
their partners "husbands."

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.770
- It feels a bit weird, right?
- We don't see that in Japan.

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:23.073
Like, "My husband's sleeping at home
right now." And I'm like, "Huh?"

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.942
But then I started
to really long for that.

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.710
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:29.313
Huwei talks about it
like it's the most natural thing.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.549
That's how it should be.

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:33.684
And I realized that
it's okay to aim for that.

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:34.919
and Izaya] Mmm.

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.356
Since we're not going to the hot springs,

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:42.326
we're not going outside
for two whole days.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.895
But you're actually fine with it, right?

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.198
- Well, yeah, I actually don't mind it.
- I'm totally fine with it too.

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.938
Hey, let's talk about
our impressions of everyone.

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.472
Hu-chan is…

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.709
But I already knew him, though.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.745
- You know, I really like Hu.
- How so?

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:03.681
He's seriously like a panda.

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:06.083
- Like Wei Wei, the panda?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.885
- Xiang Xiang.
- Hu Hu, Lin Lin, Xiang Xiang.

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:09.053
- Hu Hu.
- Yeah, like Wei Wei.

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.789
That's how it is for me right now.
So I seriously like him.

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:13.257
I just adore him.

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.226
Just watching him heals me.

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:20.264
I seriously have no idea
what kind of person he likes.

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.467
But when you went out with
him for a meal at first,

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:26.203
you both thought there might
be something there, right?

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:29.540
Well, when I was leaving,
he even walked me out.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.376
There's that side to him, too.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.478
When I posted a story about my birthday,

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:37.047
he was, like, "Was it your birthday?"
and "Happy birthday."

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:40.351
- He's like that, huh?
- So, like the way he DMs and…

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.352
Interesting.

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:44.321
The way he is in real life is
different from how he is in 2D.

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:45.956
- 2D Hu is different.
- 2D Hu is different.

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:47.491
- ] 2D Hu.
- Yeah.

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:51.762
But isn't real-life Hu better, right?

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.864
- Yeah, I like both.
- Yeah, both are good.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.874
- Oh, beautiful.
- Looks good. Really good.

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:05.976
- Looks great.
- Yum!

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.311
Looks delicious.

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:09.446
Let's dig in.

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.415
I'll start with the pickled ginger.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.283
- Mm, it's good.
- Delicious.

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:17.554
So, we all live
in different places, right?

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.690
Can you handle
long-distance relationships?

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.692
- I can.
- You can?

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:24.995
I'm the type who can. I mean,
you can just hop on a plane, right?

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.898
That was hot. What was that?

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.467
- I can do Osaka.
- What do you mean?

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.770
I can do like between Osaka and Tokyo.

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:36.206
But if it's Australia and overseas,
that's a whole different scale.

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.107
That's true.

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.410
If we can't see each other,
impossible for me.

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:42.513
I can't do it if we can only see
each other once in two months.

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:43.947
That's like Tanabata. I mean…

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:46.050
- That's once a year.
- Basically Tanabata. Exactly!

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.686
- No way I can handle it.
- It's no for me. I can't do long distance.

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.954
I would hate waiting
for even just an hour.

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.489
That's such a nice feeling.

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:56.293
That "I need to see you every minute"
feeling fades as you get older.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.030
No, it doesn't. It doesn't fade.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:01.932
I don't really feel that way recently.

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.268
When you talk about it,
it reminds me of my younger self.

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.570
I wouldn't go see
someone for five minutes anymore.

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.706
But we used to do that, right?
We used to do that.

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.741
That was just an example. An example.

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:19.783
I'll help you out here.

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.518
Mmm.

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.187
Thank you.

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.291
When was your last romance again?

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:29.493
When was your last relationship again?

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.162
- Two or three years ago.
- Two or three years, huh?

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:35.499
It's been a while for me too.
I went to Spain and…

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.568
- Just one ex.
- Hmm.

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:39.269
I dated a German guy.

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.039
You didn't see anyone else?

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.741
I went on dates, of course.

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:47.911
But… the people I was interested in
already had boyfriends and stuff.

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:49.580
- Hmm.
- Like…

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:53.417
That happens a lot, right?

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.286
Yeah, the good ones are already taken.

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:57.621
Yes! Yeah, exactly.

00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:00.524
You end up having to control yourself.

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.292
Hmm.

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.704
- What's wrong?
- What was that sigh for?

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:17.808
- You tired? Want me to take over?
- Izaya's gloomy from the ex talk.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:44.802
I trace your name
In this cold, freezing air

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:49.473
You're still a shadow
I know you are there

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.875
I'll be waiting for

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:54.478
I'll be waiting for you

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:56.079
Now hold my hand

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:58.782
I promise, I, I, I

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:00.884
I hear…

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:03.554
There's one thing I haven't mentioned.

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.926
Here, in the Green Room…

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.396
To be honest…

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:17.067
I ran into the one person
who I didn't wanna see.

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.271
That person is William.

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:29.613
Three years ago,
for a few months… we sort of dated.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.816
Something like that…
We were seeing each other.

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:36.753
I told him I liked him.
I let him know that.

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:40.324
And I wanted to take it a step further.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:44.795
But he just ghosted. Um…

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.564
He completely stopped contacting me.

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:50.467
And… we just met again here.

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:57.841
I thought he was someone who would
never be a part of my life again.

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.911
I didn't exactly erase him
from my memory, but…

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:05.148
Yeah… I kind of pretended he didn't exist.

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:09.620
{\an8}- What? Wait, wait.
- I wonder what happened.

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:11.922
I didn't fully catch it at first.
Can someone recap?

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.391
So, a while back,
they were dating for a few months.

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:17.160
And Izaya was starting
to get pretty serious about him.

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:19.563
Then, William suddenly
stopped contacting him,

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.165
so he erased him from his memory,
but they met again here.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:25.035
So, for Izaya, William is
definitely someone who hurt him.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.303
Exactly, yeah.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.972
And they met again here? I see.

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.208
What are the chances of that?

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:33.844
I wonder if they'll have
a private conversation.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:36.079
But they were working out
together in the morning.

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.547
- Oh my God!
- You're right!

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.683
- That's true!
- They even had a flirty conversation.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.520
Yeah. But Izaya didn't have
to join the gym, but he did.

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:46.356
He didn't want to see him,
but maybe he still likes him.

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:49.826
Exactly, he went anyway.

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.662
Maybe that's why he couldn't sleep.

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:54.965
Aah! That's why! Exactly!

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.433
That's it!

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.038
- You're a genius!
- You're a genius detective!

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.572
Detective Pink!
