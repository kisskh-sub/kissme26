WEBVTT

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.449
{\an8}You were the first to see
us walk in here, one by one…

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.851
{\an8}- The second.
- Fill the room.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:20.687
{\an8}When I think back to how the two of us
were at first, it's hilarious.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.956
{\an8}- Bomi was here…
- I couldn't make out their faces.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.859
{\an8}There was this light here,
and I was like, "Wait, is someone here?"

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.527
{\an8}- And you were like, "What?" Right?
- Yeah.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.830
{\an8}- The third person showed up.
- Yeah, you two knew each other, right?

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.532
- We knew each other.
- Thought so.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.967
I got here and I saw Izaya.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.603
- It was a surprise.
- I was like, "What is he doing here?"

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.606
{\an8}- I didn't know anyone. Anyone at all.
- Yeah.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:43.343
When I saw Izaya, I was like, "Wait,
aren't you supposed to be in Australia?"

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.879
When I saw you, I was like,
"Aren't you supposed to be in Spain?"

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.515
- Oh, it's starting.
- That's so funny.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.650
I was real surprised to see you.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.253
Izaya, I thought
we were connected on social media.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.587
- Like on Insta?
- No, we're not.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.923
- I thought we were connected before.
- Mm.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.760
- Maybe you unfollowed me?
- No, no, no. I didn't unfollow you.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.762
- Don't you ever update?
- Careful.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.431
- What?
- Don't you post?

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.598
No, not very often.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.701
Okay, that's why I thought
we weren't connected any longer.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.572
- Wow, wow, wow!
- Ooh!

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.807
Wow, wow!

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.414
Yeah, yeah

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.417
- Oh!
- I like it when you're tipsy

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.053
Naughty little thrill seek

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.623
Oh, oh, we can keep it flirty
Not too dirty

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.725
Does everyone know
how to snowboard and ski?

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.727
Some are better snowboarders than others.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:35.762
That's right.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.730
You tell by the way they get on the lift.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:38.998
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.634
- And how they get off.
- Also how they get off.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.304
- I'll get on the one after this one.
- Okay.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.673
- I'll get on with Huwei.
- Go with Huwei.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.042
- You?
- I can go by myself.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.543
- No, it's fine.
- Sure?

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.579
It's totally fine. It'll be fine.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.647
Gonna get down on the floor

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.952
- We can finally talk in private.
- You're right.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.653
- Do you want to?
- Sure.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.156
I wanted to ask you
about the letters we had to write.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.391
- You haven't asked about that yet?
- No, I haven't.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.927
No way. So, who did you write to?

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.930
What? You want me to say here?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.065
You can just say it.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.133
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.870
It's embarrassing.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.206
- You don't have to tell me, then.
- But you can tell me?

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.842
- I'm not telling you.
- Why? So, you want me to tell you?

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.012
- But you don't want to tell me?
- I'm not telling you. No way!

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.115
- I won't tell you either.
- If we go by seniority, you tell me first.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.784
It's the other way around.
The youngest goes first.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.387
You tell me first, you're older.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:39.325
I wanted to tell him, but couldn't
for some reason, that I wrote to him.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.195
I just… I just got, well… It was silly.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.730
I just got nervous.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:46.399
I got nervous and couldn't tell him.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.201
I thought I was the type
who could speak up,

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.036
but in that moment, I just couldn't.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.905
Something… something crossed my mind.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.940
The thing is, now… I wanna tell him.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:57.577
Now I'm like,
"Why didn't I tell him before?"

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.446
I really regret it.
I also noticed his vibe today.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.751
He was giving off a good vibe.
He had a real sexy vibe today.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.820
{\an8}MEMBER OF THE THAI NATIONAL JUDO TEAM
GRADUATE STUDENT

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.256
{\an8}You got this. Stand up.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.859
{\an8}When you're up,
shift your weight onto your heels

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.327
and come down this way, towards me.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.396
- Sure I won't fall forward?
- You won't.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.830
- I won't? Okay.
- No.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.832
If you believe you won't fall, you won't.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.770
Let's try.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.907
{\an8}- Try to stand up. Come on, get up.
- You're so strict.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.742
{\an8}- Stand up.
- You're so strict.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.811
- Stand up. Stay up.
- I can't. Whoa!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.414
Hey… try to stand up.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.317
Yeah, that's it. Good, that's it.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.718
Yeah, that's it. Just like that.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:42.288
Yeah, that's it, good, yeah.
Yeah! Okay, this way.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.526
Yeah, that's it. That was good. Hah!

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:47.927
You did it!

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.063
- So that's how you do it? Okay.
- Yeah.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.535
- He's already snowboarding? Wow!
- He learned so fast.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.870
- He's ready to compete!
- What a genius!

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:01.341
He's so athletic. I bet
his core is stronger than anyone else's.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.543
- That was great!
- Hooray.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.014
He can stop where he wants to stop,
and go where he wants to go. Awesome.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.388
Wait, I can't do this.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.657
I can't do this!

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.627
I can't…

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.762
Don't leave me behind!

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.979
Wanna get your body moving with me…

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.149
Hu-chan improved so fast.
I mean, come on! Look at him!

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.550
- He's good at everything.
- Hang on.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.352
- He's so good.
- He's just… too fast.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.421
He took one lift
and he's already over there.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.523
He's amazing. He really is!

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.126
Look at Huwei.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.030
And be down on the floor

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.098
- Make it better
- On the floor

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.566
Make it better

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.969
- Break that beat down
- On the floor

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.771
- We make it better
- On the floor

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:08.107
- We make it better
- On the floor, we make it better

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.343
Look how cool he is.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.211
He really looks like he can snowboard.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.913
- He does.
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.782
On the floor, we make it better

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.484
- Good job.
- I can't do this anymore.

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.887
- What?
- I can't take this anymore.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.322
- My butt hurts.
- Hah!

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.257
Izaya, let's go together.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:27.327
- Okay, let's go.
- All right, we're off.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.036
- I never would've guessed we'd meet here.
- Neither would I.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.705
- Oh!
- Oh, here it comes.

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.340
- We've been waiting.
- Finally gonna talk.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.208
Were you surprised?

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:49.782
Well, I'm someone who strongly
believes that everything has a meaning.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:56.155
I honestly never thought… I never
would've guessed I'd see you here.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:57.156
Mmm.

00:05:57.223 --> 00:06:00.026
- At first, I regretted being here.
- Really?

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.895
Maybe not regretted, but, uh…

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.599
What I mean is that,
at first, I didn't want to see you.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.167
Really?

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.470
I was really feeling confused.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:14.140
I wasn't sure how to interact with you,
or what I should say.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:18.411
You know, the last time we met was two…
two and a half years ago, right?

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.113
- That sounds right.
- I think so.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.015
{\an8}And back then,
we had an honest discussion.

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.085
{\an8}After that, we…
we both went our separate ways.

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.053
{\an8}Hmm.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.793
But the fact that we meet again
must have some sort of meaning.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.662
- I think it does mean something.
- I think so too.

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:40.166
You know, there are things
I wanna work on,

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:44.737
and I was hoping
that I could work on them with you,

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.006
going forward.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.710
I had absolutely no idea
you felt that way.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:53.880
I'm embarrassed.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.651
I wasn't expecting
to have this conversation on the lift,

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.987
so I was pretty flustered.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.624
Everything I was feeling,
my emotions, overflowed.

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:11.030
I was trying very hard to keep
my past feelings hidden deep inside

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.598
while interacting with him.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.136
But then I started to realize
that maybe I wasn't

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.908
truly facing
the real emotions I was feeling.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.980
I realized that hiding them, that
running away from those feelings is easy,

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:31.584
and if I did that, I knew I wouldn't be

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.020
any different from
the person I was before.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.556
So I decided to face these feelings.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.659
And I think that by finally doing this,

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:43.229
I'll be able to move forward in my life.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:57.210
- "Think easy," she said
- She said

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.946
"Forever young and so wild"

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:03.015
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:06.419
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:12.425
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.661
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.263
Maybe

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.099
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.534
We're blind, blind

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.970
- Blind
- How'd we get air all this time?

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.072
- This time
- These things

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.641
- These things
- I never thought when you were mine

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.444
We used to break it together

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.412
Oh, oh, oh

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:37.583
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.586
Are we growing older together?

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.555
Oh, oh, oh

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:47.260
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming about

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:50.530
When we were dazed and confused

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.266
{\an8}So, Izaya and William finally talked.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.734
{\an8}YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.968
{\an8}They got some one-on-one time.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:00.540
But didn't you find William's reaction
to what Izaya said a little odd?

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:02.775
It felt as if he was trying to show Izaya

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.311
that he wanted to keep things
more neutral for now.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.446
- You're right.
- I think that's exactly right.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:10.249
One thing that bothered me, he kept
his sunglasses on the whole time.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.183
Oh!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.353
I mean, don't you wanna push them up
when you're on the lift?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.088
It's different for everyone.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:18.157
- Everyone pushes up?
- Apparently.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.393
You know, the glare
from the snow is no joke.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:25.264
But don't forget, William also
took the lift with Jobu and had a talk.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:29.168
{\an8}He specifically asked him,
"Can we have a private conversation now?"

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.102
Mmm.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.271
He seems to be
a free-spirited flirt, right?

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.941
{\an8}- Maybe because he's romantically popular?
- Mmm.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.176
{\an8}Or it could be that
he's just a natural charmer.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.011
{\an8}- He's used to having admirers.
- Yeah.

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.680
That is possible, yeah.

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.482
Thank you for doing this.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.517
{\an8}Uh-huh.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.686
{\an8}- Let me know if it hurts…
- Will this hurt?

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.621
{\an8}- No, it doesn't hurt.
- Don't hurt me!

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:51.023
{\an8}- It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
- Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.992
{\an8}- Was it too strong?
- It was a bit strong.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.962
- Tell me exactly where it hurts.
- It hurts here.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.631
- This side?
- It's not the same as me.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.299
I must've fallen like this.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:03.603
Ow, that hurts.

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.738
- Oh, like that, huh?
- Oh, that side.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.473
I sprained it the other way.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.145
- Oh, wow!
- Oh no! That must really hurt!

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.547
So it really aches here.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.582
- Oh, so you probably sprained it this way.
- Yeah.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:17.683
Do you use this machine?

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.753
Yeah, of course.
I bought this when I injured myself.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.623
They say using an ultrasound device
helps fractures heal faster.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.624
Hmm, I see.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.059
- Why did he bring an ultrasound device?
- Priceless!

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.963
- Does he usually carry one around?
- It's my first time seeing that.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:35.534
- I think it feels a bit better now.
- Oh?

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.403
- It's just your imagination,
- Oh, okay.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.338
- It doesn't work that fast.
- Okay.

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.309
My turn, if you please. Okay.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.877
It's just the two of them.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.814
Oh, applying
the ultrasound gel is a little sexy.

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.816
- Feels good.
- He put a lot on!

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:53.019
Doesn't this feel like
something from a movie?

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.955
It's like the pottery scene
from the movie Ghost.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.890
Were you naturally good at judo?

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.193
No, not at all.
I mean, I'm not even that good at it now.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.996
So, when did you start thinking
about becoming a pro?

00:11:04.063 --> 00:11:05.831
It's not like my goal was to become a pro,

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:08.134
but if I was gonna do it,
I wanted to give it my all.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.135
Yeah, I get that.

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.671
At first, I didn't want to do it
because it was such a hassle.

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:12.672
- You know?
- Mmm.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.541
But once I got started, I'm
the kind of guy who really gets into it.

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:18.110
- Oh.
- So that's why I did it.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.050
We got really close
and started having more physical contact.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:28.654
I might have physical contact with people
unconsciously, although I'm not sure,

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:31.424
but if I like someone and I know it,
I probably won't touch them.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.927
I probably won't be able to touch Huwei,
at least not yet.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:39.231
I wonder why. If I follow my theory,
then I must like him.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.036
- The cooking team will cook.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:47.473
- Let's talk while we cook.
- Okay.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.909
- What's your type of person?
- Someone tall.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:53.179
I mean, obviously,
I think very well-built guys

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.048
who are popular with gay men
are really cool.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.084
But the fact of the matter is,
unfortunately,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.752
I don't end up dating those kinds of men.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.921
- Oh.
- I date really normal people.

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:04.090
Like, people who are really plain.

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.525
- Oh.
- Those are the people I date.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.161
- What about you, Huwei?
- Who, me?

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.765
- I prefer someone with a pretty face.
- Someone pretty?

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.633
- Someone pretty?
- Right. Yeah.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.304
I don't mind if his face
and appearance are a bit masculine,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.708
but if his personality is too manly,
then that can be very off-putting for me.

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:25.444
- That's kinda harsh.
- Hmm.

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.947
I know this can be
considered a stereotype,

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.050
but you've been a professional judoka
for a while, right?

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:35.621
And, as a professional, you've been around
men who are very masculine.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:38.491
- Yeah, I have.
- You've never liked any of them?

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.594
- No, never.
- Not even once?

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.499
- Hiroya was happy to hear that.
- Oh!

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:49.401
I mean, someone with a pretty face,
how can you go wrong with that, right?

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:52.271
- You can't go wrong with that.
- No one hates someone with a pretty face.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:54.173
- No one.
- Yeah, that's true.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.809
Wow! That looks great.

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.079
Wanna taste?

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.250
- Wait, I can't taste that. Too scary!
- He's giving him too much!

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.851
That's way too much for a taste.

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.453
And he was holding it up so high.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.755
- Just a little.
- Okay, here.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.825
"Aah." Open up and say "aah."

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.360
- Watch out.
- That's a lot!

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.362
- Isn't it hot?
- He can't escape.

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.097
He really has a mouthful.

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.733
- He looks really happy.
- Oh, look at that face!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.301
- Ah!
- He made a good face.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.370
The kind you make for someone you like.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.806
- Looks delicious.
- Seriously high-class cuisine.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.475
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.343
Good work today, everyone.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.247
- Delicious!
- You like it?

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:38.417
I had an interesting conversation
with Hiroya today.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.920
We talked about what our boyfriend did
that really annoyed us.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:43.923
{\an8}- Let me think…
- Like not using chopsticks properly.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:44.924
{\an8}- Yeah!
- Oh!

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.959
{\an8}Stabbing his food,
holding chopsticks like this…

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:49.862
- You really know someone like that?
- There are people who do that.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.931
Yeah, there are people
who stab their food.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.667
Jobu was saying he has lots
of examples like that.

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.669
I remember something else
that annoys me.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.737
- What is it?
- Let's hear it.

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:02.274
Let's say I like someone and he likes me,
and this person has a dream.

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:06.712
Every day, he says that his life's
dream is to work in a foreign country.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:10.249
Then finally, one day,
he gets a job offer.

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:14.753
He gets a job offer, but he says,
"If you don't want me to go, I won't go."

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.556
- "I'll put your feelings first."
- Mmm.

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.959
When he said that, it turned me off.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.227
- Yeah?
- Oh?

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:23.329
I mean, I was like,
"That's your dream, right?"

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:27.199
I'd rather have him say, "I'm going
no matter what, so come with me."

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.134
- You want that.
- Yes.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.503
Or "I'm going,
but I don't wanna do long-distance."

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.039
- You're lost in thoughts, Izaya.
- No!

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.008
I was just thinking
what I'd do in that situation.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.543
I was thinking about it too.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.878
- It's tough.
- It's tough.

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:40.379
But I get it. Yeah.

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.549
Yeah, you don't want someone
to leave everything up to you.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.851
- It's their life, after all.
- Exactly what I mean.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.420
"You're the main character in
your life." That's how I feel.

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.923
- Yeah, I agree.
- And I'm the main character in my life.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.658
That's cold.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.327
But I'll be right by your side,
supporting you.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.897
When you become partners with someone,

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.633
when you decide to share a life,
you can't just live for yourself.

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:02.935
- Absolutely.
- You have to support each other.

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:05.871
And accomplish things together
because you're not alone anymore.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.641
- Mmm.
- Of course it's tough.

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:11.443
But it seems like everyone has
gone through something similar.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.679
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:17.950
What was the one thing your ex-partner
did that made you absolutely crazy?

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.485
- He was a reckless driver.
- Mmm.

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.619
A reckless driver?

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.322
I mean, he's really good at racing,
and he zooms around the city,

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:26.025
like, vroom-vroom-vroom,
passing cars super fast.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:28.227
That's me.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.696
- The speed freak. Yeah.
- The speedster, right?

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.165
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.902
- He was reckless.
- How did you feel about that?

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:39.138
- It reminded me.
- Reminded you of who?

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:41.941
- Of your ex-boyfriend?
- Of your ex-boyfriend?

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:44.176
But you know, the way a person drives

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.912
can also reveal their personality
and how they are in bed.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.348
- How they are in bed?
- That can't be true.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.650
- That's crazy.
- I've heard that it does.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:54.153
- So, your ex was zooming all around town?
- He was real intense.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:57.256
- No, not intense, more like rough.
- Aah.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:58.924
What about you, Izaya?

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:02.061
What are you asking? If I'm rough in bed?

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.630
- Only my partner knows.
- Based on the way you drive…

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.967
- It's a secret.
- So, I guess you're not gonna tell us.

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.176
I really wanna go snowboarding again.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.744
- Me too.
- See?

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:22.915
- I wanna see the drift ice.
- Me too. I wonder if whales show up.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.851
- I've never seen it before in my life.
- There's a chance it won't show up.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:28.087
You have to be lucky.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.556
- Oh Go ahead!
- Please, go ahead.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.960
{\an8}"Starting tomorrow, the coffee truck
will finally be open for business."

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.862
{\an8}- So soon. That's weird.
- No, no!

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:40.165
{\an8}- I'm not ready.
- "The coffee truck is entirely set up."

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.534
{\an8}- "So go take a look."
- Yay!

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.536
{\an8}- Hurray!
- Let's go!

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.171
- Let's go!
- Let's see.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.206
Okay.

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:50.542
Wow! Look, we have
our very own coffee truck!

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.311
- Amazing.
- Oh! I love it!

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.946
- Amazing.
- Cool!

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.714
- Really nice.
- It's so cute!

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:59.084
- It stands out against the white.
- The checkered pattern is cute.

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.854
{\an8}- It's a nice color.
- "Us, Journey, and Coffee."

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.722
{\an8}- Hey, check it out!
- Yeah, so nice.

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:06.225
- Ooh, nice.
- Wow. It's really nice inside.

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.293
Hello and welcome.

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.764
- I like it.
- This is really nice.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.665
Just can't be feelin'

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:15.601
What I'm feelin'

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:18.804
Ah, I don't wanna wake up

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.706
I want you to stay with me

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:23.275
Promise that you'll never leave

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.710
'Cause I just don't wanna…

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.546
- Wow, I'm getting excited.
- It's like in school.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:30.482
I want to write on the board because
I never got to when I was in school.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.618
A trauma we avoided as young gay men.

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:35.187
But now we can experience the joys of it.

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:38.824
If I fill this up with the hope
that it becomes something delicious,

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.026
do you think it will turn
into something good?

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.162
Please be delicious.

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.465
- We can change the font later.
- Mmm.

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.133
{\an8}DRIP COFFEE, AMERICANO
LATTE, COFFEE FLOAT

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.269
- I think these can be closer.
- Mmm.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.473
- These write pretty clearly.
- Oh, that's really nice.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.209
Oh, you should be
in charge of writing, Jobu.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.112
Your handwriting is way cuter than mine.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:03.248
- Oh, that's nice.
- Nice.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.151
- Look, aprons. For everyone?
- Oh yeah?

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.853
- It might be cute.
- Let's.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.888
- It looks good.
- Looks best on you.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.124
- Really? It does?
- It looks best on you.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.226
- You look the part. Huh?
- What do you think?

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.928
- It doesn't look bad.
- Oh, come on.

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:18.831
- No, it's too high. This is way too high.
- What are they doing?

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:21.767
- Flirting! And Jobu's watching.
- So cute.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.769
- Oh, he saw!
- Jobu's watching!

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.304
- Here?
- Yeah.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.639
- There.
- No place for beans.

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.075
So we put them here,
and these go a bit more to the right.

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.977
- The menu is ready too.
- Wow!

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.213
Oh, wow. I'm impressed!

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.948
Isn't it amazing? It's a proper menu.

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.850
- A proper menu.
- A proper menu.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.719
{\an8}Bomi, who would you choose?

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.155
I wonder who.

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:46.925
It's a secret.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:48.594
Who would you choose?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.462
- Have you decided?
- Huh? Well, I…

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:53.132
Yeah, I have.
The one I wrote the letter to.

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:58.403
Um, I might want to get
your advice just as a friend.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.972
- You wanna go?
- On a few little things.

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.140
Oh, I get that.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.908
But what will it say if I pick you first?

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.176
- I see what you mean.
- Yeah.

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.278
Yeah, I get it, because if you pick me,

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.946
then the person you really wanted to pick

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:09.681
is gonna think
you're not interested in him.

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:12.184
- Or think, "Hey, why didn't he choose me?"
- Exactly. That's why.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.753
- That's a concern.
- Yeah, that's the tricky part.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.356
Yeah, that's a concern, definitely.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.795
I wanted to ask everyone,

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:26.265
who was your favorite in season one?

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.467
- Kazuto.
- Really?

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:30.002
- Mmm.
- Oh, Kazuto, huh?

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:33.472
- What did you like about him?
- Well, first off, he seemed very calm.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.108
He was also a chef, and he was very sweet.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.410
- Yeah, that's true.
- It was his… his voice and…

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.212
- His tone?
- Yeah, his tone, everything.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.447
- His whole aura was sweet.
- He had a calm vibe.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.416
{\an8}- That was cool.
- He did. Who was your favorite?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.852
{\an8}Well… I'd say it was Taeheon.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:48.754
- Likewise.
- Mmm.

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.290
- You liked Taeheon?
- Yes, Taeheon.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.457
Can you tell me why?

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.927
- Come on, tell me why?
- Well, it's because he's also calm.

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:56.962
In fact, it's really simple,
I just think he's cute.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.430
You're right, I think so too.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:02.034
- Taeheon seems like he speaks his mind.
- I also think he's kind of a princess.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.869
- He's a princess.
- And you, Huwei?

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:07.005
{\an8}Well, I'm kind of torn
between two of them.

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:08.807
{\an8}- Tell us who!
- Yeah, who?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.842
{\an8}I liked Taeheon and Shun.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.611
- Oh!
- Shun?

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:15.013
They're so different,
but both of them are a bit…

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.181
Is that what you like?

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.383
- Can you explain?
- Tell us.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.852
- Well, Shun has a pretty face.
- Yeah, that's true.

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:24.089
I get that. What about his personality?

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:27.960
- Personality… Well, I think he's funny.
- You're right, he is funny.

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.828
- You get his sense of humor.
- He's your type?

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:33.165
And I like Taeheon because
he has this big sister vibe to him.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.967
He does have a big sister vibe.

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:37.269
- Big sister?
- But they both act like princesses.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.271
- They're both princesses.
- Yeah, both.

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.039
- Shun and Taeheon.
- True.

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:42.407
Maybe that's your type?

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.143
- Taeheon was popular.
- Yeah, he was.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.880
Both Hiroya and Jobu
designated Taeheon as their favorite.

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.483
- Mmm.
- Do we know if princess types are popular?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.686
Well, that's in fact
a very tricky question.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.056
Having a princess-like personality,
and also a princess-like…

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.425
For example, if you have muscles,
or if you're good-looking?

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.128
- Obviously, you're going to be popular.
- I see, I see.

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.931
But when you have a princess personality,
it's a tricky skill to master.

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.432
- Oh, I see.
- Mmm, I see.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:08.967
But some people are into it.

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:12.537
I think Huwei is actually a sensitive,
big-hearted person,

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:16.575
since he said he likes princess types, and
chose Shun and Taeheon as his favorites.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.945
- That's amazing.
- I think this will earn him major points.

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:21.680
He also knows how to cook.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.682
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, he's amazing.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.151
- He's the perfect package.
- He can do everything.

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.120
He even provides ultrasound treatments.

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:31.189
Amazing! I've never seen
anyone with that device before.

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:34.426
Why did he bring it? I mean,
he packed it in his suitcase on purpose.

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.594
He thought he might need it.

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:37.996
When he was choosing what to bring,
he decided to bring this.

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:41.099
But he's not great at proportions
for tasting, right?

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:44.102
- No. That wasn't a tasting portion.
- His idea of having someone taste food?

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:46.605
The portion to distance ratio
was a bit off.

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:54.279
Kazuyuki,
are you letting your beard grow out?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.684
{\an8}- Mmm… I haven't thought about it.
- I didn't even notice.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.286
You look younger without it,
wouldn't you agree with that?

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:03.822
- It's not like I want to look younger.
- You know what?

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.591
- You should tie your hair back like this.
- I can't do that.

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:09.494
- You can, you can totally do a man bun.
- You mean slicked back?

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.229
- Tie it here.
- Cute!

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:13.965
- You look like a samurai.
- It's the man bun.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.902
- Nice.
- It's not long enough.

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:20.038
- Like a defeated samurai.
- Mmm. A defeated samurai is bad.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.441
He's all over his hair.
They seem pretty close.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.509
- Yeah.
- Wait, what's the expression?

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.812
"Everything you do looks good?"

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:29.214
- "Everything looks good on you."
- That's it.

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.016
- It doesn't look good on me.
- It does.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.718
You'd look great with it shaved.

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:34.553
- That might look nice.
- Maybe.

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:39.925
- They really are close.
- He's playing hairdresser.

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.462
Just wait till he looks in the mirror!

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.334
Oh, but that would make a cute picture.

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.702
It's super cute.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.038
It's a really good picture. Cute.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.576
- Whoa!
- Oh!

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.579
- It's stylish.
- Oh, hey, it's stylish.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.781
- Looks good!
- It's cool.

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.683
Oh.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.151
- It pinged.
- Oh, a message.

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:09.654
Damn, it's the first day.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.223
- It's exciting.
- It's started.

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:14.359
- It's started.
- "We have an announcement."

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:17.863
- Oh!
- What?

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.731
{\an8}- What?
- Huh?

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:22.934
{\an8}"The shift leader for today is Bomi."

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:25.504
{\an8}- Aah!
- Bomi.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.507
{\an8}"Bomi, please choose
one person you would like to work with."

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.877
{\an8}- What? This is nerve-racking.
- Whoa, really? Come on.

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:35.046
{\an8}"Once you've decided, please
turn over that person's nameplate."

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:36.281
{\an8}Mmm.

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.716
You're first up.

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:44.423
- It's a little nerve-racking, huh?
- Yeah.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.526
What color is it?

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.298
- Really nice!
- A nice bright color.

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.133
The color of the sky and the truck.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.269
- It's stylish.
- Very stylish.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:08.747
Who will it be?

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.455
Wait, I feel really nervous.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:22.727
Hu-chan?

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:26.698
Oh.

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:28.700
- Oh.
- So cute.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.902
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.437
- Have fun.
- Good luck.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:33.638
Good luck.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.155
This is exciting.

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:52.390
Yeah, I'm excited. I hope we can sell.

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.464
Wow. So this is what it's like.

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:01.633
Here we go.

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:07.405
Take care.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.875
- Hey, you look the part.
- Good luck.

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:10.909
Good luck.

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:18.216
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.318
Huwei, drive safely.

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:22.387
Take care.

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:25.991
And I cry when I see

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:28.126
Everything out there

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.962
Oh, it's over out there

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:33.899
It's over for him

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:38.370
Will anybody give a damn about him?

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.006
With what he did?

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:44.409
- It's cold today.
- Yeah.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.380
SEVEN GUYS LIVING TOGETHER AND SELLING
COFFEE. ON TODAY, HUWEI AND BOMI

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:53.985
- Oh, nice.
- It looks good, right?

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.053
- Yeah.
- Amazing.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.556
- Do I look like a pro?
- You look like a pro, definitely.

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.059
- Trust me.
- Are you sure?

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.896
Wait, the flash went off.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.032
Hey, this is fun.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:09.234
Okay, we did it.

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:11.136
- Oh, nice.
- They're so cute.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.538
Hello and welcome.

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.106
Please look at this.

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.577
Look at this.

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:22.547
Do you think
they're speaking Chinese? Yeah?

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:25.584
Hello, do you speak Chinese?

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.919
- I do.
- All right.

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:31.222
What would you like to drink?

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:34.960
- This actually happens?
- He's nailing the customer service!

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:38.363
- He's so helpful!
- Wait. Isn't he amazing?

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.032
The menu has… Do you want black coffee?

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:44.069
- Drip coffee.
- Drip coffee. Medium.

00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:45.136
Coffee, medium?

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:48.306
Drip coffee is 500
yen. The latte is also 500 yen. Thank you.

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:50.909
Sorry, I don't understand.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:53.411
They would like
one drip coffee and one latte.

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.113
Do you think you could you make the latte?

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.381
Yeah, okay.

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:03.421
- Here you go. It's done.
- Is it ready?

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.126
- Thanks for waiting.
- Thank you.

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:11.096
- Here are some wet hand towels.
- Thank you.

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:13.498
- I'll send him for more later.
- Right. Thank you.

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:14.599
Right, thank you.

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.771
Yay!

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:22.340
- Yay!
- We sold coffee.

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.778
- A latte, yeah.
- Okay, I'll make one. Thanks.

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.683
- Here's the Americano.
- Okay.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.320
Thank you. Take care.
Thank you for coming. Bye.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:44.763
Wonderful. That's wonderful!

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:48.266
- How much did we make?
- I don't know. I don't know yet.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.035
We work great as a team.

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:52.037
We might not have sold
anything without you.

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:53.405
TODAY'S SALES
6,850 YEN

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.241
It's done!

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:58.777
- Microwaved Wagyu.
- Japanese Black Wagyu.

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.812
Domestic Wagyu in the microwave?

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.181
That's so like you, Izaya.

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.816
It's Izaya-style.

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:07.552
This is the expensive meat,
and this is the cheap meat.

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.888
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.289
Enjoy your meal.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:14.225
- The expensive meat first.
- You should. It's delicious.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.428
- How is it?
- Mmm!

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.430
- Is it good?
- It's really, really good.

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.999
- Like grilled meat. It's good.
- Right?

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:24.436
By the way,
Bomi and Huwei knew each other, right?

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.771
- Yeah.
- I heard they were friends.

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:28.406
- Mmm.
- I was surprised.

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.340
That's true.

00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:32.577
I mean, it's not like I know every detail
of how they knew each other.

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:35.814
- I think they just went to dinner once.
- They just went to dinner?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.449
- Apparently, that was all.
- I see.

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:39.417
That means their feelings
are still there, right?

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.453
I don't know They just went to dinner.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:44.956
Even if one had feelings, maybe
the other didn't and it didn't go further.

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.325
- Yeah, that's possible.
- So we really don't know.

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.160
If I were to guess what happened,

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.129
I think Bomi had feelings.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.198
- But Huwei wasn't feeling the same.
- Yeah.

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.466
- Mmm.
- Oh!

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:57.102
So I wonder what Huwei
might be feeling right now.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.004
I didn't mean to imagine it.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.448
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:12.050
Looks warm.

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:16.087
- Oh, it is warm.
- Oh, it is warm.

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:24.362
So, I picked you, Huwei,
and I want to thank you for coming.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:25.330
Mmm.

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:29.367
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this.
Was it okay?

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.036
It's kind of weird to ask, "Was it okay?"

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:35.240
I think it worked out well, personally.

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.644
- We made a good team.
- We made a really good team.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.316
But I have to say,
even though we were friends before this,

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:49.154
I realized that there might be
a lot of things I don't know about you.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.588
What didn't you know?

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:53.291
I mean, we've never really talked
about our points of view on love

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:55.994
or had a deep conversation
about anything at all.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.396
So, what is your point of view on love?

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.599
I've never really been in a
proper relationship per se.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.535
- So everything is new to me.
- Mmm.

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:06.304
I'm looking forward to finding
that special person.

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:10.575
Someone who can make me happy
just by being with me.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:11.709
- You know?
- Mmm.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.379
I want to spend my days like that.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:16.114
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:19.150
Do you have a preference?
An ideal type?

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:22.020
- My type?
- The kind of person you're drawn to.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.659
Oh… I like people who you can sit down
and have a serious conversation with,

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.627
who won't run away from
an important discussion.

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:30.528
Yeah, I get it.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:33.731
Otherwise, I feel like
some of the more important things

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:36.768
might get too difficult to talk about
if set aside for too long.

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:37.869
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:41.406
- I wanna have those conversations too.
- Really?

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:43.408
Yeah, of course I do.

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:47.779
We still have time. I hope
we can get to know each other better.

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.114
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:52.817
There might be things
we don't know about each other yet.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:55.019
Definitely. I think there are many.

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.758
Okay…

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.702
- We're finally back home.
- Yeah.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.208
- Oh!
- Hey!

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:19.410
- Welcome back.
- Are you cold?

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:22.213
- Do you need help carrying anything?
- Anything you need help with?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.249
- Anything to bring in?
- We're okay.

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.217
- Oh, Hiroya's curious.
- Yeah.

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.485
He's curious about them, see?

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.354
See? He's choking!

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.855
"Oops." His chest hurts.

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:35.226
He was so focused on them,
he didn't see the ice cube fall on him.

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.695
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, we did have fun.

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.031
- Oh.
- Cute!

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:42.567
Today, I decided to go out
and buy some flowers.

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:45.303
- Oh, wow, that's so cute.
- This is charming.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.205
Are the flowers in a 3D printed vase?

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.907
- Is it really?
- Well, is it?

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:51.242
- I actually have a 3D printer.
- Really?

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.244
I thought so.
I thought this was 3D printed.

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:54.545
- Really?
- See?

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:56.514
- He brought a printer with him? Why?
- 3D.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:58.850
- He brought a printer! See?
- No!

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.419
- He's making something.
- Wait a minute.

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.488
He wants to give form to his feelings.

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:05.857
They really surpass
your expectations, don't they?

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.192
Smart people do things
that surpass your expectations.

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.694
- True.
- Where did you go?

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.496
- To Lake Akan.
- Oh, Lake Akan.

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:12.597
That's nearby.

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:15.400
But the problem was that there
was no one there today.

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:17.201
- There was absolutely no one.
- Mmm.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:19.504
- It was really tough.
- What?

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.440
- Tell them, tell them.
- The most important part.

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:23.908
What's the total?

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.210
How much was it? 6,850 yen.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:28.579
- Whoa! You sold a lot!
- You sold quite a bit.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.815
- I thought you'd say zero.
- Me too.

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:33.818
- You said there was no one.
- Actually, a lot of people came.

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.553
- Oh, come on!
- That's more like it.

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.927
- Okay.
- That's nice, right?

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:45.129
Yeah, but it feels really lonely
with just one picture.

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.798
- There'll be more soon.
- There'll be more.

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:49.367
As expected,
running a business brings people together.

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:52.470
- All kinds of conversations.
- Did you notice?

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.605
- The vibe changed between them.
- It changed.

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:57.375
- It was different.
- I feel we've been left behind.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:00.411
I know! They looked like
they'd moved onto the next step.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.648
Like, "I'm different from you."

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:06.551
- Something was forever different.
- It's sad.

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:12.056
Of course I'm curious about what happened
during their shift. Of course I'm curious.

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:16.961
But there's no elegant way to ask,
and it's rude to ask anyway.

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:21.599
I feel like today really allowed us
to get closer to one another.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.603
During our talk, I was able to open up
and tell him how I felt,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.138
and I think Huwei really got it.

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:31.576
I think running the coffee truck together
helped deepen our bond we already had.

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:35.046
Or should I say showed
just how compatible we are together.

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.080
Mmm, mmm.

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:39.384
So far, Bomi and Izaya are
the only ones in the group

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.419
who have expressed their feelings, right?

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:45.156
But the two guys who those feelings
were told to haven't taken action yet.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.058
Right? So what do you think about that?

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.862
If you meet someone again
a few years later in a different context,

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:53.164
does your heart skip a beat?

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.767
Or do you not care about them
anymore? Do you see what I mean?

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:59.303
If you meet them again and feel that
they've changed, you could fall for them.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.338
- Yeah.
- Ah.

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:03.641
You know when you get that feeling
that they've become a better person?

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:07.378
Sometimes people can overcome their
faults, they can get a little upgrade.

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.781
- And you end up liking who they've become.
- Mmm.

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.582
If it's been maybe ten years,

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:14.118
yes, I can definitely think of them
as a different person.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.553
But if it's only been two or three,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.755
even if they've grown a little,
people don't change.

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.657
That's how it was. You're right. Yeah.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.061
- I don't know how it was, just…
- Sorry. You're totally right.

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:26.431
You know, saying, "That's how it was,"
feels like a personal experience.

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:31.869
{\an8}But he also said, "I'm the type of person
who thinks everything has meaning," right?

00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:32.770
He did.

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:34.038
- So…
- He did say that.

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.975
So I feel that he thinks it's destiny
and that he's still into Izaya.

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:39.143
- Oh.
- Oh…

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.246
But if Izaya hears stuff like that
every day, he might be a bit on edge.

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:44.248
Well, Izaya is basically always on edge.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:47.018
He's like, "So tell me, how do you feel?"

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.454
I get it. I definitely
don't think I could handle it.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.354
It's tough.

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:53.091
{\an8}- Every day might be rough.
- To have someone say that to you.

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:55.726
{\an8}He probably thinks about it so much,
he can't sleep.

00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:58.496
{\an8}- Exactly.
- He's not sleeping.

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:01.065
You can tell there's
an intense attraction between them.

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:04.669
But the question is "Will this
relationship be a healthy relationship?"

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.737
- I don't think that will be the case.
- Yeah.

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:08.840
But unhealthy relationships
are much more fun.

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.775
- Yeah. That's just how it is.
- True.

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:11.809
When it comes to love?

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.911
- The messier it is, the better it is!
- Yeah.

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:15.513
Am I right?

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:24.155
Oh!

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.893
- Please read it.
- He's gonna tell us.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.229
"The person in charge
of today's shift is…"

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.897
- Who?
- Oh.

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.733
{\an8}"The person in charge
of today's shift is…"

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:39.871
{\an8}- "Jobu will be on duty."
- Whoa! What do I do?

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:42.173
{\an8}- It's you.
- This is nerve-racking.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.144
{\an8}"Jobu, please choose one person you would
like to work with during today's shift."

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.513
This is super nerve-racking.

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:50.515
- It is, isn't it?
- I need some water.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.119
Hmm.

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:03.294
- He's so stiff.
- He's really thinking.

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:04.662
Yeah, he is.

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.670
- Oh.
- Hey, it's William.

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.240
Soccer player, let's work together.

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.708
Let's work together.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:20.845
- Wonderful. This is great.
- Nice. It's a good team.

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:21.946
This is great.

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:31.923
- That was unexpected.
- Mmm.

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.157
Did you know?

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.759
- Yeah.
- No way!

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:35.893
I knew from before.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.496
- I had no idea.
- I knew Jobu would pick Will.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.666
If you watch closely, you can
notice that they're together a lot.

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.335
- I see they're together a lot, but…
- They're always together.

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:45.770
Oh, you're right.

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:47.038
I didn't feel it at all.

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:49.040
- I don't think William felt it.
- Seriously?

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:50.374
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:10.761
Rise up, ascending melody

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:13.664
Climbs to the heavens for you

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:15.433
Crazy.

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:17.702
The snow is crazy.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:21.672
The snow's gonna pile up quickly.
I hate this.

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.084
Hello and welcome. How are you?

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:36.354
We're selling coffee,
if you're interested.

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.557
- Three café lattes.
- Total? Okay.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.491
Thank you.

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.460
What's happening?
Where did they come from?

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.795
- There's too many!
- They came all of a sudden.

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:58.409
- Our bus is here.
- Ah, okay.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.645
- So we need to hurry.
- Yeah.

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.013
Okay!

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.381
We have to hurry.

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.682
Ah, sorry.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.052
This is hectic!

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.454
The lid won't fit.

00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:12.923
The first time for you?

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.993
Yes, this is my first day. So sorry.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.263
- Yeah, my first day.
- Yeah, our first day. Sorry.

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.766
I can't get this lid to fit.

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:23.034
Okay, we can…

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.771
- Okay. One more latte. This one.
- Okay. We can…

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.839
We can do it, we got this.

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:31.542
Sorry!

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:33.577
Chocolate milk. You can put yourself.

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:35.579
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.415
- Thank you, sorry!
- Have a nice day!

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:39.317
- Bye!
- Have a nice day.

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.921
- We did it! We did it.
- You bet!

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.724
Ugh! That was so hectic!

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.260
I can't do this. Let's clean up and leave.

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.896
I think we did well.

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:55.533
- We did well.
- Great. We're a good team.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.901
TODAY'S SALES
6,450 YEN

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:01.972
What should we do today?

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.676
There really isn't much to do.

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.478
We can build an igloo.

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:09.380
- You like igloos?
- No one wants to?

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.115
Let's go. I totally want to.

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.951
- We can go look for a place to build one?
- Right over there.

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.820
It'd be cool if we could see it from here.

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.822
- You're right.
- That'll be cute.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:19.623
We can see it from the window.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.059
We can use it to talk in private.

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.828
- Good idea.
- Go and chill.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:25.162
Important discussions.

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:27.365
- That sounds great.
- So, should we do it?

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.270
- Okay.
- It's really snowing.

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.039
Let's do this.

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.410
Aah!

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.582
We need to make this bigger.

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:47.518
Let's get some more snow.

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:57.962
I worked very hard on the igloo
while thinking about William.

00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:00.197
We'll be able to go in there together.

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.768
I don't want
another half-hearted relationship.

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:09.106
Yeah, what I want is to be able
to tell him that someday.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.641
Hmm.

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:14.245
Not many people can build an igloo
while thinking about someone.

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:17.281
- You don't hear that very often.
- That's true.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.216
I can understand if it was knitting.

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:21.452
- This should do it.
- But he loves him.

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.720
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.121
He loves him.

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:27.291
I feel like I'm back in the real world.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:30.661
Aah!

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.363
Good job. Well done, seriously.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.533
No, you guys did a good job.
It looks great.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:40.004
We were able to finish it quickly
thanks to everyone. Seriously.

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.957
I don't know how
to start this conversation.

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:02.893
- So true. It feels formal.
- Exactly.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.195
- Shall we start?
- But I was--

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.463
- Huh?
- I was surprised.

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:06.363
- Today?
- Yeah.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:11.202
You know, I didn't choose you on a whim.
I knew from day one who I'd pick.

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:13.637
- Because I wrote you the letter.
- You did?

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:16.140
- He told him!
- Good for him.

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.309
- You knew since you wrote the letter?
- Yeah.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.713
Since I first saw you.
My mind was made up since day one.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.982
- Really?
- Wow, he told him.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:28.552
I haven't looked at anyone else
but you since day one.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.654
That's the truth.

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.090
- Whoa, he's going for it.
- Well done, Jobu!

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:35.593
- I thought I was being pretty obvious.
- Really?

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.228
- Mmm.
- But you were always joking around.

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:40.130
Yeah, that's true.
I can't do serious conversations.

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:43.167
Even now, when I know
I have to have a serious conversation,

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:44.902
I can't help joking.

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.604
- I laugh the whole time.
- I see that.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.439
I get embarrassed and laugh.

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.376
When I'm struggling,
or lonely, or having a hard time,

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.745
or working hard, or stuff like that…

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.715
I don't really show it.

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.450
Okay…

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.319
I'm glad, really.

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.387
Really?

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.995
- What kind of expression is that?
- Yeah, I wonder.

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.369
- Hey, no laughing.
- What?

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:21.005
- No laughing.
- No laughing? I can't help it.

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:23.040
- No laughing.
- I can't laugh?

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.676
But we had a serious conversation.

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:33.183
- We got through another day.
- Good work, everyone.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.252
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.088
- This looks delicious.
- It looks good.

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:41.892
- The cheese is really nice.
- The cheese is nice and stretchy.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.261
- Wow.
- It's hot.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.930
- It's good.
- Sure is.

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:46.997
Yum!

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.434
How did it go for you two?

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.670
- It was fun.
- It was fun.

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.705
We had fun today too.

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.640
- What did you do?
- It was fun.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.309
- I want to hear.
- A great time.

00:42:58.375 --> 00:43:02.246
Since we didn't have a private room
where two people could be alone here,

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:04.014
we decided to make one ourselves.

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.617
- What? Seriously?
- Your attention, please!

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:07.651
Huh?

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:08.852
Ready!

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:12.790
You made that? That's amazing! Oh, wow.

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.391
That's amazing!

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.827
You really made something like that?
Have you gone inside?

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.896
- You can fit three in.
- Even five.

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:21.599
- So cool.
- Snowman has a well-defined nose.

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.002
- Huh? Oh!
- Look.

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:27.871
Oh, no way, look…
The deer might go inside. That's so cool!

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.909
- It's leaving.
- Oh, too bad.

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:33.510
It was checking it out.

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:36.513
- It really is cute.
- Izaya worked so hard.

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.450
- He did a lot of digging inside.
- I dug, dug, dug…

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:42.653
- It looks nice with the snow.
- It's really nice. It'll be used a lot.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.922
- Yeah.
- Two people can be alone there.

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:47.524
- It can easily fit two.
- We can drink coffee.

00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:48.759
Awesome.

00:43:57.568 --> 00:44:00.004
I don't even know you

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.840
We met the other night
For not a long time

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:05.409
One day, I'll talk to you

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.344
One day, I'll be with you

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:09.647
Never getting used to you

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:12.349
But I'm feeling all right
Got my mind a little light

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:16.987
With William, it was like, nine years ago.

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.823
That was probably
the very first time we met.

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:23.694
We just met.
We didn't exchange info or anything.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:27.898
Then, three years ago, what happened was…

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:32.102
Well, I remembered having met William,
but I knew nothing about him.

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.437
I found him on Instagram.

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:37.041
I remember messaging him and saying
"We should meet and catch up sometime."

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.910
And that's how it started.
I remember our conversation.

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:42.146
We talked about his family for a while.

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:47.317
Right from the start,
we had a deep conversation.

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:48.752
I remember it clearly.

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:53.357
It kind of ended with
a promise to meet again soon.

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.993
Every now and then,
we'd go out for drinks,

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.363
or we'd hang out at William's place,
or go to the gym together.

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:03.033
I'd say we did that for about
two or three months.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.470
I think we were meeting
around once a week. Hmm.

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.674
How did it happen again?

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.945
The thing is, I don't remember.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.115
Was it on Insta?

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:22.853
Was it at a bar?

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:26.924
What I remember most is going to the gym.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.660
But I feel like
it was only two or three times.

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:32.129
- No more than four.
- Hold on a second.

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:34.998
- How can their memories be so different?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait…

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.835
- Hang on, hang on…
- This is what you never want.

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:40.671
- Hang on a second.
- I mean, it's totally…
