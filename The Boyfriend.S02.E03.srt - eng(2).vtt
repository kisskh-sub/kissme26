00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.616
{\an8}What kind of dance is salsa?

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.318
{\an8}- I can't dance.
- Come on, let's dance!

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.620
{\an8}What do you mean, let's dance?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.555
{\an8}Uh, I can't even hear the music.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.060
Huh? Salsa? It's salsa, right?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.962
Wait, wait. What?
Like this.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.064
I don't even know what we're doing.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.433
- No, no. Take a step back.
- What? I step back too?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.335
Yeah, yeah. Then, now… dance.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.704
- Like that? Okay.
- And step back. And dance.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.007
- Step back. We dance. And step back. Yeah.
- Step back. Then?

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.676
- Then this, and then…
- Like this?

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.345
You're so stiff, man!

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.813
- Stiff?
- Yeah!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.150
Only a true quirky soul would
do something like this!

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.918
Yeah, true. This gets you hooked.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.654
- This will make Jobu fall for him harder.
- It will.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.925
So, like this. One, two. One, two. Step.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.393
- You can't do this!
- Step.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.462
Why is he doing this out of nowhere?

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.164
- Oh! Kazuyuki's head!
- Whoa!

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.600
- He scared me!
- That's it.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.503
Don't just pop out of nowhere, Kazuyuki!

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.511
{\an8}Oh.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.615
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.385
{\an8}"The person for today's shift…"

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.755
{\an8}- "Huwei will be on duty."
- Oh!

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.457
{\an8}No way. Today, as well?

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.058
- What a turn of events.
- Huwei.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.560
- Again.
- Huwei.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.562
{\an8}- Popular guy.
- Huwei's going again.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.397
ART DIRECTOR

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.267
- Oh? Who are you picking?
- I wanted to know his feelings.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.813
{\an8}Izaya!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.182
{\an8}- Oh!
- He's consistent.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.718
- I can't see.
- Oh, Izaya.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.520
- Who?
- You.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.123
- It's you, silly!
- Oh, me? I just couldn't see.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.592
- Your reaction!
- Okay. Ah, you're right.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.762
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.565
I have to stay behind.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.648
- "Think easy," she said
- She said

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.384
"Forever young and so wild"

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.454
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.857
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:44.063
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.100
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.701
Maybe

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.538
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.972
We're blind, blind

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.408
- Blind
- How'd we get air all this time?

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.677
- This time
- These things

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.079
- These things
- I never thought when you were mine

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.882
We used to break it together

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.851
Oh, oh, oh

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.922
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.025
Are we growing older together?

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.960
Oh, oh, oh

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.298
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming about

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:21.968
When we were dazed and confused

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.841
{\an8}Was it complicated? Kinda?

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.476
After Huwei?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.478
Yeah, it stung a little.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.547
- Didn't it look like he had no doubts?
- That's true.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.717
- Felt like he already decided on Izaya.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.619
I didn't think Huwei would pick him.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.054
- Wasn't that kind of mean?
- Izaya?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.556
I honestly was a bit shocked.
Like, I picked him two days ago,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.091
and then he picks Izaya?

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.127
I thought, "Wow, public execution."

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.463
I had no idea what face
I was supposed to make.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.069
But I swear I wasn't actually smiling
then. I was forcing it so hard.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.639
- I was forcing myself to make a big smile.
- Yeah, I felt that.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.674
- You did? Ugh, that's embarrassing.
- I could tell.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.343
I'm super embarrassed.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.112
I had a mix of feelings.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.783
I was partly a little pissed,
but also a bit hurt, too.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.386
But last night, I told him,

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:16.256
"Huwei, you should
definitely pull your bangs back."

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.359
You know, I think
you should show your forehead.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.363
- Should I pull my hair back?
- You definitely should.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.266
- Really? Okay, I will.
- Looks good.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:31.604
And this morning, when he had his bangs
up, I was like, "Whoa, he did it."

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.240
That made me a little happy.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.211
- That would make me happy.
- Stuff like this makes me happy.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.586
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.454
You should wear gloves too.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:50.823
Here.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.196
It's cold.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.132
- Right?
- It's freezing.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.034
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.236
- Here's the menu.
- Thanks.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.472
- I want chocolate milk.
- Looks good.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.242
- The chocolate milk's really good.
- Looks great.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.678
- Four.
- Four chocolate milks? Got it.

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.813
- Chocolate milk? Okay!
- Four chocolate milks.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.015
I'll make the milk.

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:18.785
Okay. Great customer service.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:26.025
The sun's coming out.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.364
Sorry for the wait.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.467
- Please be careful, it's very hot.
- Thank you.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:35.768
Thank you.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.938
- One drip coffee. Small, please.
- Drip coffee, okay.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.641
- Chocolate milk, please.
- Thank you so much.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.309
That'll be 850 yen.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:47.180
Um, uh… first, 20 grams…

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.016
Hey, can I?

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.552
- The beans are…
- In the back.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.420
- Yeah, inside of the bag.
- Ah, the bag.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.189
- They're in the bag.
- Okay.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.793
First, here's your hot chocolate.
It's hot, so please be careful.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.729
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You're in a hurry, right? Sorry.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.397
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.566
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.502
We should speed up.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.438
Yeah. I wonder where we slowed down.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.873
Was I slow?

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.812
Not sure… Yeah, a bit slow.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.348
{\an8}Right.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.218
{\an8}I'll do better next time.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.253
{\an8}TODAY'S SALES
5,100 YEN

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.691
I've been wondering
about something for a while.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:35.328
When we all first met,
you said you already kinda knew…

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.198
You mentioned something
about knowing Huwei from before.

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:42.135
Um, only you two know what
happened between you, but…

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.903
- But…
- Oh, it's nothing special.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.872
We just went out to eat and stuff.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:50.343
But yeah, that first dinner wasn't
exactly just friends grabbing food.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.813
It was like we were both kind of
interested in each other at that point.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.516
Yeah, yeah. I kind of figured as much.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:00.653
And then… you picked Huwei again here.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.523
You know what I mean?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.325
I don't mean to sound harsh,
but it ended, right?

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:11.063
Whether it was a date or something casual,
whatever it was.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:16.135
It didn't go anywhere after that because
one of you didn't want it to, right?

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.303
I guess so.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.041
- So why do you go for it again?
- But to me, it felt a bit like destiny.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.210
Hmm.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.916
Well, I wanted to take this opportunity
to get to know him better.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:33.820
And me too. When I came in,
I already knew Izaya.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.423
So, like you said,
I thought, "Maybe it's fate."

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:42.728
But if it didn't happen back then,
it's not like it would now.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.031
If it were really meant to be,
we'd already be together.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.632
- Exactly!
- That's what you mean, right?

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.936
But even when we first met,
it already wasn't like that.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.738
- Yeah.
- That's what you're saying, right?

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:58.778
True, but I still wanted
to talk to him more.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:04.784
{\an8}YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.619
{\an8}He's wondering how he feels.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:09.755
{\an8}William was projecting onto himself.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:13.025
{\an8}He was asking someone else,
but also asking himself.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.128
- But William said he thinks it's over.
- Mm-hm.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.597
Yeah, yeah. The last time.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:21.934
So, Izaya says it's over too, but
it was a really important love for him.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.172
They're talking about "over"
in totally different ways.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.174
{\an8}They're stored
in different folders in their heads.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.877
{\an8}- Completely different feelings.
- You're right.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.879
For someone who says it's over,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:37.149
William's smile looked pretty into Izaya
when he was slicing mangoes.

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:40.052
- That's the thing!
- And when he was making coffee.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:41.654
What's that about, then?

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.590
That might be a part
of his open and quirky personality.

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.825
His quirkiness!

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:48.961
At the very beginning,
William and Jobu were dancing, right?

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.563
- That…
- To silent Latin music.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.664
Silent salsa.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.733
- Silent salsa!
- That was not fair.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:57.403
- So, is that him being quirky? Right?
- That's so right.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.007
So he's the kind of person
who always shows affection.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:04.010
- Right, right.
- He just likes getting on with everyone.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.078
We thought it was only the two of them.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:09.048
- Kazuyuki suddenly pops into the frame!
- He popped in from below!

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.751
- The way he showed up…
- He couldn't take it.

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.986
He was like, "I can't stay here."

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:17.456
- And that's why he left.
- I'd hate it if they did that behind me!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.595
It's so beautiful.

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:24.263
All white.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:26.966
Wanna take a break?

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.872
- It looks like a station.
- Right? Cool spot.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:41.547
Okay.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.283
It's warm.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.785
- It is, huh?
- Yeah.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:48.054
- Let's write in the journal?
- Yeah.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.358
- How was the teamwork?
- I'd say it was pretty good.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.193
- Yeah, it was good.
- I think so too.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.766
Oh. By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.202
- What?
- Who did you write your letter to?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.937
- My letter?
- Yeah.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.973
- Why?
- The letter on the first day.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.574
- Guess who.
- Who was it?

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.909
Who do you think?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.279
I thought it might be me.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.048
You drew a smiley face on the blackboard,

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.919
and in the journal, the same smiley
face that was on the letter, too.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.887
Ah, no!

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.591
- I was like, "I saw that in my letter!"
- Busted.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.793
Damn.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.696
{\an8}- Did I draw a smiley face?
- Yeah, there was a smiley face.

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.264
{\an8}Totally forgot.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.533
He got busted!

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:39.772
But that letter made me so happy.
What you wrote made me really happy.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.674
{\an8}I LOVE HOW YOU TALK
AND THE WORDS YOU USE!

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.443
{\an8}You got me. It felt like
you really wrote about my inner side.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.578
{\an8}I HOPE WE GET TO TALK MORE.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.280
I've always liked how you speak,
honestly.

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.883
Oh. Thank you.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:53.919
Yeah.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.691
Shall we go?

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:00.860
- Hey, go in front.
- Huh?

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:01.827
- Go on.
- Why?

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:02.728
Just do it.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.865
Hey!

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.568
I tripped. Aah!

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.973
- Isn't it soft? Feels nice, right?
- Feels great.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.642
- Love and snow go well together.
- So nice.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.812
This view is nice.
We can even see the moon.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:24.083
- Yeah. It feels amazing.
- This is so Eternal Sunshine!

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.219
- I wanna fall into the snow!
- Oh, they're already doing it.

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.632
Did everyone go to the sauna?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.267
{\an8}- Sauna, did they go already?
- No idea.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.769
{\an8}- Not yet?
- I think everyone was in their rooms.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:56.215
Bomi, when you chose Huwei
on your first day,

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:01.120
you just wanted to have one-on-one
conversations with everyone?

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:05.357
Or do you kinda see him
as someone special?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.497
Well, I've known him for a while now.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.698
Right.

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:15.868
I was scrolling back
through our DM conversation.

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:16.836
Hmm.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.972
And he wished me
a happy birthday and stuff.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:24.310
He actually reached out to me a lot,
and I didn't really notice at the time.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:28.647
Not didn't notice, more like, I only found
out when I looked back on our chats. So…

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.649
You realized, "Oh, he was thinking of me."

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.384
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why…

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:34.854
Even though I went out
for dinner with him,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.356
I realized there was a lot
I didn't know about him.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.361
So first off, I wanted to talk with Huwei.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.797
So that's why I picked him.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.133
How about you, Hiroya?

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.368
- I've decided.
- You've decided?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.436
Hm?

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:52.638
Yeah, I have.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.310
I think I want to talk with Huwei too.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.579
Nice.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:07.620
Yeah. So, I wanted to ask what
you had in mind when you picked Huwei.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:12.458
Got it. But I also feel that way a little.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.895
That's why I picked him.
And I told him that.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.097
- That you're interested in him?
- Yeah.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.865
I want to know more about him too.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:23.702
That was the main reason,
and I told him that's why I picked him.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:24.770
Hmm.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:27.907
I see.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.253
- What do you do for work again?
- For work?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.190
For work… You know
what a data center is, right?

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.091
- Data center?
- Yeah. Data center.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:49.728
You know, like the data centers
for banks and the government.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.931
So, we take
the customers' information and…

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.933
- Super important.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.434
So it's cybersecurity?

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.771
- No.
- Then like a security guard?

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.940
- No!
- Didn't think so.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:03.809
I actually… build data centers.

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.245
They run 24-7, 365 days a year.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:07.880
- Always running?
- Always running, right?

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.882
You know, when
you withdraw cash at an ATM,

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.585
you're actually connecting
to a data server, like your bank's server.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.787
If that infrastructure
goes down, that's it.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:18.457
You absolutely can't let it crash.
If it does, every ATM stops working.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.826
That's hundreds of millions in losses
in just a few seconds.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:24.396
So we do all kinds of calculations
to make sure the system never fails.

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.498
Basically, we calculate how much power

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:30.002
each machine or server
can pull from the power supply.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:33.439
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah. And how much heat they generate…

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:36.976
- So you're like a director?
- A project manager.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:43.549
So you're overseeing pretty much
the whole data center? In a nutshell.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.185
Yeah, the entire… Mmm.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.587
Wait, did you just give up?

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.756
You did, right?

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.127
Lately, we've been a lot closer.

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.630
I'm not sure if it's just me thinking
that we're getting closer,

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.865
but I'm kind of totally falling for him.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.433
Falling for him, huh?

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.801
So cute.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:07.306
Butterflies. I mean, it's been a week
without touching anyone, right?

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.074
I haven't even hugged anyone yet.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.911
So a part of me is craving
some human touch.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.980
It's kinda too soon, but, like…

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:17.917
I want to do it already.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.886
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.956
Right now, he's just getting horny.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:27.426
- He's smitten… and a little turned on too.
- And kinda turned on, I guess!

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.029
{\an8}Hey, hey, hey.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.931
{\an8}B. T. C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:37.870
- We're home.
- Welcome back!

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.973
- Was it cold?
- So cold.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.508
- Freezing.
- So cold.

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.643
- Oh, you both have earmuffs on.
- Cute.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.112
- Are you making a hot pot?
- Yeah.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:50.249
- Nice. Looks delicious.
- That's some fancy napa.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.818
Thanks.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.553
- Good work.
- Good work.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.522
- Looks really good.
- Thank you.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:58.991
I want soup.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.661
- How is it?
- So good.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.730
- Good, good.
- This hits the spot.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.898
Hits the spot?

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.701
- Was it cold today?
- It was cold, wasn't it?

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.102
I think it was pretty cold today.

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.337
- It was cold.
- I see.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.871
What did you guys do today?

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.940
We were just chatting around here.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:17.810
Like what to get
for birthday gifts and stuff.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.012
A letter would make me the happiest.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:21.013
Ooh!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.182
- Letters didn't come up.
- No way.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.750
- They didn't.
- As a gift?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:25.684
Yeah.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.353
I don't need material things.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.321
- Oh yeah, someone said no material stuff.
- A trip.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.657
- A trip together.
- Not material things, but a trip.

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.560
- I prefer experiences.
- A trip is nice, experiences are nice.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.395
- But I'd like a letter.
- As we said.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:39.431
- Would you read it right there?
- You don't say, "Read it now!"

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.799
Right after they hand it to you?

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.267
- Just give it normally?
- Yeah.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.703
- You'd read it later.
- And feel warm and fuzzy.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.605
- Yes! Exactly.
- Warm and fuzzy.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.474
- I want that.
- Letters are better.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.542
- You can keep them.
- You can keep them.

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.077
Letters are pretty special.

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.112
Hmm.

00:16:57.716 --> 00:17:00.819
First time I've seen someone use
that spot. Does it feel good?

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.621
- Here? It's nice.
- It's flat.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.690
- It feels really nice.
- I could sleep here.

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.692
Me too. You really could.

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:09.528
Are you tired?

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.764
Nope. How was your day?

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:13.799
- It was fun.
- Whoa!

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.967
That was so smooth!

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.502
- Right?
- I'm jealous.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.737
Don't you think I've got so much arch?

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.807
What do you mean? You only have one arch.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.776
- I have a super high arch.
- That's what you mean?

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:27.079
- Yeah, it's super curved.
- Oh, I see. Do you like that?

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.447
Oh!

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.116
Doesn't it hurt? Like hurt so good?

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.851
I'm not pressing that hard.

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.687
- Hurts so good?
- Oh my.

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:37.356
- This is…
- Ooh!

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.291
- Got it?
- It might feel good.

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.959
- Oh, it feels good.
- Right?

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:46.165
William went to run the
coffee truck yesterday, and I went today.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.867
So we haven't been able to talk at all.

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:54.740
I wanted to show him some affection,
and that's what I came up with. A massage.

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.509
Hey, hey. Can you stand up?

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.745
I want to try a quick hug.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.713
Whoa, big!

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.316
- But like, this feels just right.
- He's really big.

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:06.485
- Jobu's size is nice.
- It's nice.

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.387
Try hugging him. He's huge.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.190
- You're tall too.
- That might be a good match.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.591
Oh, this feels nice too.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.162
- Okay then.
- He is huge.

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.465
Doesn't it feel like he wraps around you?

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.334
It's pretty nice, hugging Hiroya.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.969
Your chest is really big.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.572
- Oh, you're slim. Really slim.
- Yeah.

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.240
Between two slim guys.

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.509
Which do you prefer, thin or thick?

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.111
- Thicker.
- Muscular.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.378
Jobu started all this.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.480
But actually…

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.081
- Perfect fit?
- Perfect.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.584
- Because of this.
- They're craving human touch!

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.751
How is it?

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:43.055
- Who hasn't gone yet?
- I haven't hugged William.

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:46.825
- Jobu, let's do it.
- No, I'm okay.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.760
- I'm okay! Aah! Okay, okay!
- Go on!

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:52.030
- That's enough!
- Don't go, "Okay!" Enjoy it.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.840
Jobu just wanted to hug William, right?

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:04.710
- William was the one he didn't!
- That's how it is.

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.012
- Even though he wanted to.
- That's sad.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:13.919
There it is, there it is.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.021
"For today's shift…

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:17.589
{\an8}Izaya will be on duty."

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:21.326
{\an8}- Two days in a row.
- Back-to-back.

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:22.494
{\an8}So busy.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.632
- I'm most curious about this.
- Yeah.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.133
Hard to predict.

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:31.570
Everyone's starting
to get a sense of each other's feelings.

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.373
- It feels tense when it's time to choose.
- Right? Yeah.

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.918
Let's do it. Let's do this.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.625
- Have a good day.
- See you.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.513
Let it all out.

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:18.350
I'm just feeling down.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.420
Seriously, I'm bummed out.
Totally bummed out.

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.390
I've been feeling totally bummed out
since this morning.

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:28.227
- I mean, those two are just so close.
- You're right.

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:31.964
They're together all night too.
I can't get in between those two.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.532
- I mean…
- True. No one can.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.001
- You can't, right?
- Yeah, they're a bit intimate.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.703
They feel pretty intimate.

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:40.539
And… they're a better match.

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:42.841
Don't say things like that.
You don't know that.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.743
I mean, they're closer in age too.

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:48.413
- It's tough when it comes to this.
- You still have a chance.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.982
Like…

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:54.653
If you back down now, it'll be too late.
That's true. I need to pump myself up.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.922
- Pump me up. Come on, hype me.
- Hype you up?

00:20:56.989 --> 00:21:01.360
Yeah. But still,
they sorta look better together.

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:05.764
That's not true.
You've got your own charm, Jobu.

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.532
- That's true.
- You're great.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.836
- A ball of personality.
- Oh, wow, I'm starting to feel better.

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.938
- You are?
- I'm starting to feel confident.

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:16.441
- You have so many great qualities!
- I'm starting to feel confident.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:20.045
I mean, I've never met
someone so fun to be around.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:23.081
- Pure happiness vibes.
- Total happiness vibes, that's you too.

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:25.517
- Happiness.
- You radiate happiness too.

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:27.119
Then we both radiate happiness.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.454
Let's put that aside for now
and talk about you.

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.389
About me?

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:34.926
So I was talking with Hiroya, and he
talked about who he wants to go with.

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:35.994
Oh.

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:39.231
I picked Huwei, right?
Hiroya said he wants to choose him too.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.733
- Oh, didn't know that.
- And I was like, "What?"

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:46.038
But when someone else shows interest
in Huwei like that,

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:47.839
I start feeling antsy too.

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:48.774
Ah.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.344
My emotions are in a tangle.
I can't tell if it's love or just anxiety.

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:54.980
- It's hard to tell, isn't it?
- Really hard to tell, right?

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:58.283
- But it's different for you.
- What?

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.619
- You've been all-in from the start.
- Yeah.

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:06.658
It pisses me off that
he's just so handsome.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:12.130
It really pisses me off, seriously.

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:15.534
You should go all out and put yourself
out there. Let Jobu out.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.803
- Oh no, should I?
- Yeah, put yourself out there.

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:18.970
- Should I go for it?
- Do it.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:22.207
Honestly, I almost kissed him
a few times, you know.

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.845
- Wait, I'm gonna spill my drink!
- Careful, careful! Sorry, sorry!

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:28.980
Careful. I'm trouble, you know.

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.816
They look like they're having fun.

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:31.817
"Should I go for it?"

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:35.153
It's nice to have friends
like that when you're in love. Yeah?

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:45.397
Oh

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:50.102
I don't mind a backseat driver

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.537
If it's you

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:53.605
Okay.

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.075
- Turn around.
- You can tell me to turn, turn

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:58.643
- Yeah, you're good.
- Is it okay?

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.379
It's not twisted. Yeah.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:04.549
Should we take the menu
and call the customers over?

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.351
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:10.355
Wow, it's so pretty.
I want to take a picture.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:14.092
- I'll take one for you.
- You can tell me to go, go, go

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.361
Go, go, go

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:17.896
Nice.

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.901
- Nice.
- The weather is so nice.

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.636
Good weather makes me happy.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.942
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:32.144
Hello.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.045
Sorry to bother you.

00:23:34.112 --> 00:23:36.281
We're selling coffee. Please come by

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:38.884
- After we finish fishing!
- We'll be waiting.

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:46.792
You know, it's fun staying in
and goofing around with everyone, but…

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.729
we haven't had any time
to talk one-on-one.

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.665
I didn't think I'd be working with you
with these feelings.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:54.900
What do you mean?

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:57.602
Huh? I don't know.
It's just a weird feeling.

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:58.603
Feels weird?

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.607
Yeah, like, I thought I knew, but I don't.
You get that feeling, don't you?

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:04.910
Right.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.648
Oh, hello.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:11.716
- You came!
- Of course.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:13.118
- I'm glad.
- Thank you.

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.855
- One small café latte, and…
- Sure. Yep.

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.590
- You have oatmeal cookies?
- We do.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:21.159
We've got one oatmeal cookie left.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:22.994
- Thank you.
- Is that okay?

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:23.929
Yes, please.

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:25.730
- Did you catch anything?
- We did.

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:28.033
- How many?
- We got a lot this time.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.303
- Sorry to keep you waiting. It's hot.
- That's okay. Thanks!

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:34.239
- Thank you! See you!
- We hope to see you again.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:37.609
- Please come again. Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:43.048
What were you talking about earlier?
We got customers in the middle of it.

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.349
Right, right.

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:49.387
Hey, when we met on the first day,
did you regret coming here?

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:52.023
Well, I didn't regret it,
but I had mixed feelings.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.391
Yeah, I can imagine.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.126
So, um…

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:59.364
Yeah. Well, I want to ask you a lot.

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:02.100
- Like what?
- Like, why you're here.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.935
What made you decide to join.

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.337
Mm, mm, mm.

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.207
I mean, we went out
a few times before, right?

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:10.208
Mmm.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.814
But honestly, I don't really know
how you felt about me back then.

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:17.549
I see.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.352
Yeah… I see.

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:22.787
Izaya's feelings
hadn't reached him back then…

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.422
TODAY'S SALES:
3,100 YEN

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:25.357
Ugh, come on!

00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:28.927
{\an8}- You can't sell anything with that energy.
- It's really like that.

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.029
- It depends on energy.
- It's contagious.

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:33.131
- Your energy totally affects sales.
- Right, right.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.467
But when it's someone you really liked,

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:39.671
someone you thought you'd shared
something deep with, say that to you…

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:40.739
{\an8}It kind of makes you go…

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.274
{\an8}- It hurts.
- Shocking.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.943
{\an8}- "Wait, what?"
- You realized it was one-sided.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.913
It wouldn't be surprising if he thinks,
"If that's how it was, forget it."

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:50.715
- Totally fair.
- I'm not sure.

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:55.787
I think I totally get why Izaya,
who's usually pretty grounded and calm,

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.089
would be drawn to William.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:02.060
He appears to be a very,
like, super bold and a free-spirited guy.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:04.095
He's just so different from him.

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:06.231
I guess so. I get it, I get it.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.434
So, even after hearing that,
I don't think he'd back off.

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.870
- I agree.
- He's already in too deep.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:14.472
- Right, right, right.
- - He's so into him.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.841
- Past the point of no return.
- Already past it?

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.810
- He's already fallen.
- He's in this much?

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:21.146
- He's in, he's in.
- Yup, this is where he's at right now.

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:24.249
- I think he'll go for it.
- I can't tell William's feelings.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.051
- No clue.
- I can't either.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:28.286
Maybe he doesn't have feelings for him,

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:32.724
or maybe he's more conservative
than he looks?

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:35.627
- So we're already in deep too.
- True.

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.162
- Completely.
- You're right.

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:49.107
- Is this Hiroya?
- Oh, is that a 3D printer?

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:53.111
- Yeah, is that a printer?
- He's brought all kinds of stuff.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.016
He went to Huwei's room. He's going.

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.121
Is he gonna scan him?

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.858
- Scan Huwei?
- "Let me take your 3D data."

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:14.199
- Would you like to go downstairs a bit?
- Okay.

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:19.838
Is this a good spot?

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:26.077
I was thinking… I've talked with you
with everyone else around often,

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:28.680
but we've never been alone together.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.116
- You're right.
- So I've been wanting to chat with you.

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.617
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:36.655
- And Izaya went with Will today, right?
- Mmm.

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:39.491
So I figured you might have
some thoughts about it.

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.326
I wanted to ask you about that too.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:45.930
At this point, all I can think is,
"Oh, so that's how it is."

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.365
Hmm…

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.635
So it's not like you're feeling down?

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:53.605
I'm not exactly feeling down, but…

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.008
Yeah, I did wonder
what he thinks of William.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.310
Yeah. Well, I'm curious
about that just as much.

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:00.412
Yeah.

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:04.482
I wonder if everyone picks
the person they're interested in

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.484
to run the coffee truck with.

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:09.988
Or do they just decide
they want to work together?

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.990
- We just don't know their motives.
- That's true.

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:15.260
- Hmm.
- Speaking of that, how was it for you?

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.161
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:19.831
I guess it was mostly because
I was interested in him.

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:22.000
- Hmm.
- Anyway…

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:27.038
What I want to tell you is, that I…

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.675
Right now, the person
I'm most interested in here is you.

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:33.678
Hmm?

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:36.481
- So I was going to pick you.
- Oh, I see.

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:37.682
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:42.120
But I didn't get a chance
to pick this week.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:43.254
I see.

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:47.492
I just felt like I should tell you
how I feel as soon as possible.

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:50.462
That's why I wanted
some alone time with you.

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:52.097
Right, thank you.

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:55.400
I was just afraid my feelings for you
hadn't gotten through.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.601
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:59.504
Aaah!

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.740
- No way.
- He said it.

00:29:01.806 --> 00:29:04.476
- Hiroya…
- Everyone's playing fair and square.

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:08.213
Many of them are being
very straightforward.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.082
{\an8}- He told Bomi that he would be upfront.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:14.185
{\an8}- And he really followed through.
- That was impressive.

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:17.088
{\an8}Isn't this the first time that someone
has knocked on someone's door?

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:19.357
{\an8}- That's right.
- A pretty bold move, isn't it?

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.993
{\an8}- "Let's go downstairs for a bit."
- Right?

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.100
How was running the coffee truck today?

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:33.171
Yeah. I was a little worried about
our teamwork at first.

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:35.173
- But it went well.
- It did?

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:39.010
When I met you three years ago,

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:42.213
I don't think I was able
to show my true self.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.414
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:49.154
So today, when you said that you didn't
really realize how I felt back then,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.190
I thought maybe
I didn't express myself enough.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.893
- Right.
- Mmm.

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.396
And then we both went
to different countries, right?

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.699
I went to Australia
and you went to Spain.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.134
Mmm.

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.270
But I couldn't forget about you.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:09.240
Honestly, you were always
in the back of my mind.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:11.743
Yeah.

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.513
In the end, I remembered,

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:19.117
and I think I was the one

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:22.020
who stopped responding, was I?

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:26.858
It's not like I wanted you, um…
to chase after me or anything,

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:30.461
but I felt like you wouldn't have
come after me anyway.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:39.404
And I thought maybe that's all it was.

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:41.906
That's how I was feeling.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:47.312
But now that, um…
we've met again like this,

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:50.381
I think there's some kind
of meaning to it.

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:52.584
It feels like…

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.953
I chase your name…

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:59.424
…I've been given another chance
to face you and work things out again.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.292
I know you are there

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:05.296
It's only because we happened
to already know each other.

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.732
I was surprised to see you here.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.703
And to be honest, I didn't expect
things to turn out this way.

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:14.639
I wanted to ask you about that.

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.307
The reason you decided to come here.

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:18.309
Why was that again?

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:23.781
Well, um… honestly, I didn't know
if I'd find someone or not.

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:27.719
But my biggest goal was
to find a life partner.

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:31.322
Yeah, I guess that's why I came here.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:35.293
With love

00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:40.431
I can change the sky above

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:45.103
And rise a little higher

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:46.371
I see.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.775
If you came here
with that reason and saw me,

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.145
I'm sure you must have felt something.

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:57.849
From your point of view,
it must feel like destiny.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:58.883
Mmm.

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:05.156
But I don't know if this is destiny,
or just the universe messing with me.

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:09.394
Mmm. But since I'm here…

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:15.967
I want to really face things head-on,

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.036
to confront them,

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.773
and find my true life partner.

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:23.708
That's why I'm here.

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:26.344
Like…

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:32.884
I want you to know
that I'm serious about this.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.219
I think I'm just falling

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.689
Falling for you

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.328
Back then, three years ago, I think I was
trying too hard to only show my best side.

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:46.597
We'd only meet on dates,
or only meet at the gym,

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:49.500
and I was holding back a lot
and being overly careful,

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:54.739
trying to match William
instead of trying to show my true self.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:57.308
I just hope he could tell
how serious I was,

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.844
how much I was really trying to reach him.

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.546
You know?

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:06.351
I hope he feels like, um…
he got to see a new side of me.

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:07.618
That's how I feel.

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:12.924
Yeah, I'm not sure why, I just can't help
but wonder if he really means it.

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:16.961
But I know that's not his fault.
It's probably my fault.

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:22.600
That's why I don't want
to get his hopes up or lead him on.

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:26.270
So right now, I'm not sure
how to interact with him.

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:31.409
Now hold my hand, I promise that

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:35.913
- 34.
- Wait, 35?

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.914
No, 34.

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:40.351
- When's your birthday again?
- July.

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:44.722
Do you remember when
I celebrated your birthday once?

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.190
What?

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:52.797
You don't remember?

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:56.034
No way, really? How many years ago was it?

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.037
- Oh, I remember now, I remember now.
- You remember?

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.809
- I remember, I remember
- You punk.

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:07.278
- You remember?
- I remember.

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.479
You remember?

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.949
- I remember.
- Not three, four.

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:14.886
That's true. Ugh, I'm terrible.

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.455
- I'm terrible.
- You forgot?

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.657
I just remembered.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.795
Okay, if you remembered,
then, I'll… forgive you.

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.298
- Man, I'm bad. This is not good. Hold on.
- I'm just relieved.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.735
Back then, I was like…

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:35.640
I was just a single guy, and…
I probably met a lot of people.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:37.975
And I think Izaya was one of them.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.345
- Well, that makes sense.
- Yeah, that's fair.

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:42.980
That's what it was.

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:47.051
But maybe William is actually the kind
of guy who has to see that he's loved,

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:49.854
like he needs a lot
of constant reassurance?

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.190
- You know what I mean?
- Hmm, maybe he's a little insecure?

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:56.060
It seemed like he was asking,
"Do you like me? Really?"

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:58.996
He sounded to me that he really
needed to make sure.

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.565
Maybe he's passionate?

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:03.000
- Maybe he's not as confident as we think?
- Maybe not.

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:05.736
But didn't Izaya look
super handsome in that moment?

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.672
- Very handsome.
- He looked determined.

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.574
The face of someone who's
made up his mind.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.410
He said he came to face this,
with even some regrets.

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:16.047
- That was cool, wasn't it?
- Yeah. He didn't back down even a step.

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.649
Oh.

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:21.486
{\an8}"For today's shift…

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.056
{\an8}Hiroya will be on duty."

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:27.758
{\an8}- Here we go! This right here!
- They have their own drama!

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:30.728
{\an8}- Long-awaited.
- He's the best at making lattes.

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.965
{\an8}"Hiroya, please pick one person
you want to work with."

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:36.300
- Okay, here I go.
- Go for it.

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.604
Who will it be?

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.739
- No idea.
- This is hardest to guess.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.555
- Will you come with me?
- Let's go.

00:35:58.289 --> 00:36:00.358
- Let's do this.
- Cute.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.429
Bomi's smile isn't coming naturally.

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:06.831
He's forcing a smile.

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.770
Oh, this is nice.

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.472
- I'm getting hyped!
- Yeah.

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.210
- I don't think I can put this on.
- I'll help you.

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.212
Wait a second. Like this, right?

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.148
Yeah. Thank you.

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:27.318
- Please.
- Like this and…

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.589
I'm Thai! I'm cold!

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:32.490
{\an8}HUWEI
FROM THAILAND

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.825
What if we get Thai customers?
I can't speak Thai.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.462
- They might miraculously come.
- They might.

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.799
Hello. Come join us.
Would you like some coffee?

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.135
- Would you like coffee?
- Oh!

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.503
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.205
Did you want to look at Lotteria?

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:50.141
- You're from Thailand?
- Yes.

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.376
- From Thailand.
- Oh, that's good.

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.912
- Oh, Thai customers!
- It happened! What a miracle.

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.847
That's so wild.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.850
- Oh. Huh?
- There are Thai people. Thai customers.

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:02.153
- Oh!
- You can speak Thai?

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.422
- I'm Thai.
- You're Thai!

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:07.792
I can only speak a little Thai.

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:14.298
- All right. Chocolate milk.
- Chocolate milk.

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:17.368
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.605
Thank you.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.673
That was cool.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.009
My Thai was terrible, I'm embarrassed.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.179
- You can speak it to an extent.
- I understand what they're saying.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.914
- But I can't speak much.
- I see.

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.217
TODAY'S SALES
5,050 YEN

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.924
What time is it?
Oh! It's later than I thought.

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:43.561
- What should we comment?
- Let's write something.

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:52.336
- Okay.
- Random. I wrote something super random.

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.576
- Huh?
- Open it.

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:01.612
Whoa!

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.516
- Thank you!
- I bought it earlier.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.319
It's the one I really wanted.

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:09.987
- It's cute, isn't it?
- So cute.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.556
I'll take a picture for you later.

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:16.160
- Aww, so adorbs.
- Adorbs!

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.728
Thanks. I'm so happy.

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.096
Looks best on you.

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.431
TSURUTAN

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:24.335
But I feel like that kind of stuff
actually gets to someone like Huwei,

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:26.304
maybe more than you'd think.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.674
I get the feeling he's the type
who'll cave once he gets that final push.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.574
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:33.144
- He's gonna push. He's going all out.
- Yeah.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.313
- Then Bomi will…
- How will he react?

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:38.616
{\an8}- Good question.
- But this is all new for Bomi, so…

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.919
{\an8}There was that moment when his love
almost turned into frustration.

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.522
{\an8}Like, "Why are you going?
Why aren't you choosing me?"

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.324
{\an8}There were moments
when he was pissed off.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:50.227
{\an8}That's why if Hiroya and Hu-chan end up
together, Bomi might lose control a bit.

00:38:50.294 --> 00:38:52.363
{\an8}I wonder what Bomi will do
if that happens.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.497
{\an8}Yeah.

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:55.966
{\an8}Everyone's personalities are
starting to show little by little.

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.368
{\an8}Yeah.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:04.208
- Wanna go to the gym?
- I wanna hit the gym.

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:06.077
- I'll get some rest.
- Mmm.

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.978
- Then…
- Take a bath.

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:09.714
- I want a bath.
- Take one.

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:12.917
- Whose scent is that?
- Whose is it? Jobu?

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:14.418
Is it me? Smell me.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.654
- Bomi.
- Doesn't it smell super coconutty?

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:20.224
- No. It's Jobu's hair.
- Isn't it my hair wax?

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:24.095
- It's Jobu's hair.
- Oh, it's Jobu. My coconut arrived today.

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.663
What do you mean, your coconut?

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.898
- You mean oil?
- My coconut oil finally arrived.

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:30.534
- Finally!
- What do you use it for?

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:31.702
- Hair?
- My whole body.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.938
- Full-body oil?
- You'll be oily?

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.741
It's for my hair, my skin, everything.

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:40.077
- There's something here. Some clumps here.
- Get it off.

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:44.348
Got it.
You've even got some on your beard.

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.917
- No! This is terrible. There are so many.
- Got it, got it.

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.086
- Don't give up!
- This hurts!

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:51.322
- No one hates seaweed, right?
- I love it.

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.124
I love it.

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.593
I wonder if they're selling well.

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:58.262
I feel like those two
would sell a lot. Make bank.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.764
They would, they would.

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.701
At what point does it count as cheating?

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:06.270
- I don't really wanna talk about this.
- Why not?

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.005
I think my definition's off from the norm.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.442
If it's just sex, I don't mind
if you go ahead and do whatever you want.

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.077
- You'd hate it.
- I don't like it.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.045
But I'd be like,,
"Just go ahead and do it."

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.947
- It's cheating if feelings change.
- Yeah.

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.916
Cheating is fine
as long as you don't get caught.

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:21.118
- Same! Exactly, exactly.
- That way of thinking…

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.888
- But you'll get caught.
- I hate to say it, but that's true.

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.923
You say it's cheating
if your feelings change,

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.726
but isn't it over anyway
if you develop feelings for someone else?

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.861
It's cheating if you catch feelings.

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:32.630
Some people catch feelings
for someone else,

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:35.533
but can't bring themselves
to end things, that's cheating.

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.902
People who stay
in a relationship out of habit.

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:39.670
But have you ever cheated?

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.672
Depends on your definition of cheating.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.875
It's not fair if I'm the only one
who has to answer. I've never cheated.

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:47.478
- You have!
- Never.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:50.047
- You sound like you have!
- No, no, no, never, never.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.283
So it counts as cheating
as soon as you take action.

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.919
Yeah, as soon as it gets physical.

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:58.422
So if they go all the way,
it's immediately over?

00:40:58.489 --> 00:40:59.423
I wouldn't forgive them.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.725
- Mmm.
- I'd forgive them.

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.527
- I might forgive them.
- What?

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:06.530
I just think you should
value yourself better than that.

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.865
Do I not?

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:11.602
I mean, if you forgive them,
they'll think you're that kind of person.

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:14.038
- They'll walk all over you?
- They'll take you lightly.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.108
I mean, I tell them,
if they cheat, it's over.

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.711
If they cheat,
they're the ones who will regret it.

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.013
They'll probably regret it
for the rest of their life.

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:27.852
I cheated once before, a long time ago.
And I regretted it afterwards.

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:29.119
When was that?

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.356
- Before.
- Before?

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:36.760
- My last relationship.
- You mean the most recent one?

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:38.596
- Oh no, oh no, oh no.
- Yeah.

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:41.632
Cake ingredients.
Maybe I'll make cookies instead of cake.

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:44.301
- It ended up a good thing.
- He got all vague.

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:46.670
We don't have a cake mold, though.

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:48.205
He's bad at this.

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:52.910
Well, there were a lot of reasons for it.
It didn't just happen out of nowhere.

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.514
Everyone's facing totally
different directions. Hilarious.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.482
They're all pretending not to be there.

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:09.493
I broke up with my boyfriend
of seven years because he cheated on me.

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:14.932
Looking back, it just feels like
maybe there were a bunch of lies.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.034
I can't help thinking like that.

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.270
There probably were.

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:22.439
It's not exactly like
I can't trust people anymore,

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:26.810
but… I just can't help
but wonder why they lie.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:27.878
Like…

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:32.316
being in a relationship
with someone like that

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.386
feels like it would bring
uncertainties in the future.
