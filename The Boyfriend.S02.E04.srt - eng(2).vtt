00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:21.388
IT SALES WORKER

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.729
{\an8}IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.434
- Who goes first?
- Hmm?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.270
- What's wrong?
- Well…

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.939
It's because
of what we were talking about.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.043
- Yeah.
- Did I say something weird?

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.181
No, but, I was just thinking,
"So William is someone who cheats."

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.351
It got me wondering a little.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.090
No, there was a reason for it. Seriously.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.261
It wasn't exactly cheating,
it was just kissing.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.967
So, we kissed, and then…

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.503
it ended up turning into a big deal.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.638
Mmm.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:17.644
Somehow, he found out,
and decided to cheat for real.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.713
But if he had trusted me
and not done anything,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.149
things wouldn't have turned out like that.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.251
- Hmm.
- It wasn't that simple.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.620
So you're saying
it wasn't all your fault.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.757
It wasn't my fault at all.
Well, it was both our faults.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.360
You also said there was a reason
that you did what you did, right?

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.897
Well, let's drop this.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.866
Yeah, but I'm glad I got to hear about it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.768
Let's talk again.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.407
- So don't get turned off.
- Don't worry. I feel better now.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.043
I was surprised
by how affected you were by this.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.946
Can I be the one to start?

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.749
I feel better now.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.887
But hearing something like that
makes you think, doesn't it?

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.623
- Mmm.
- I've grown from this.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:08.495
I've analyzed my mistake
and reflect on myself objectively,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.665
because I never wanna repeat
something like that ever again.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.871
- It might not be a big deal, though.
- No, it is a big deal.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.106
Wow, he's putting him on the spot.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.641
- He really is.
- He does that.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.612
Each person defines
their own personal values, right?

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:26.980
- Including cheating.
- Mmm.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.583
Yeah, but I don't think
the definition matters.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.420
I think it depends on whether or not

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.957
you really offended the person
you were dating.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.325
Mmm. Mmm.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.061
That's why I can say I've grown.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.564
Mmm.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.735
He's using the mirror to stare him down,
he won't let him get away.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.706
He talked about
how it wasn't like he cheated,

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.842
in the sense
of sleeping with someone else.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.745
So that was really a huge relief.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.348
I mean, I feel like
I got to know William a little bit better.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.851
On the contrary, I was impressed.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.253
Usually, people try
to avoid talking about something

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.522
that happened to them like that to others.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.059
But he talked about it honestly
without hiding anything,

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.929
and I thought he sounded very sincere.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:20.667
I can tell that what he experienced in
that relationship has really changed him.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.180
- "Think easy," she said
- She said

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.916
"Forever young and so wild"

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.986
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.389
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:49.395
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.632
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.234
Maybe

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.070
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.504
We're blind, blind

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.940
- Blind
- How'd we get air all this time?

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.042
- This time
- These things

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.612
- These things
- I never thought when you were mine

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.414
We used to break it together

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.383
Oh, oh, oh

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.554
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.557
Are we growing older together?

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.525
Oh, oh, oh

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:24.230
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming about

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.500
When we were dazed and confused

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.237
{\an8}UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.172
{\an8}TELECOM SALES WORKER

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.743
- How's it going lately?
- Lately?

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.446
- Yeah, I'm worried about you, Kazuyuki.
- Really? Thanks.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.216
- Yeah, I'm worried about myself, too.
- Why is that?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.151
What do you mean?

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.920
Are you still nice to everyone?

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.224
- Hmm, well…
- Like, I want to have a chat with you.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.394
Yeah, I wanna talk to you too.
I wanna talk with everyone.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.928
- I get that.
- The thing is…

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.331
- Let's talk in private today.
- Sure.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.536
- I'm really worried about you.
- Hmm.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.105
I feel like you're still being
considerate around everyone,

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.674
and everyone's worried about you.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.108
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.009
I see.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:13.212
It's like, you don't need
to be so considerate.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.116
Being considerate, that's just
part of my personality, you know.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.618
"Am I good enough?"

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:22.255
That question's always in my mind,
no matter what. I always ask myself that.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.024
- Yeah, that's what I do.
- Did you lose confidence?

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.360
Hmm, I wasn't that confident
to begin with.

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.363
Hmm, I mean… yeah, I don't know.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.732
Everyone here is
fairly talented, aren't they?

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.267
Yeah, I guess.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.804
Yeah, they are.
But I seriously can't do anything.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.807
Seriously,
I just want you to know one thing.

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.009
I don't know much
about academic backgrounds,

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.611
but if you look at it that way,
yeah, they're all very impressive.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.015
- Yeah.
- But you also have lots of good qualities.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.819
You're really thoughtful,
you have a broad outlook,

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:56.489
you can take initiative,
like to do the dishes and stuff.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.991
You have a lot of wonderful qualities.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:03.696
So far, I'm just
really enjoying living with everyone.

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:04.997
- Good, that's good.
- Yeah.

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.499
- I'm glad you feel that way.
- Yeah.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.901
I'm having a blast, and it's fulfilling.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.338
Don't worry. Time will take care of it.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:17.910
Yeah. Little by little, I think
my true self will start showing.

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:21.080
Yeah, I hope that happens,
and I'll be attracted to someone,

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.982
and he'll be attracted to me.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.917
That's my ideal situation, since I'm here.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.552
Yeah, that's why you're here, after all.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.554
- That's right.
- Let's do our best.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.790
I'm glad
they were able to talk about this.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.796
What kind of person are you attracted to?

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.465
I love it when someone can
laugh wholeheartedly.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.902
I get that. And, on the contrary,
what is it that you can't stand?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.904
- Besides cheating.
- Besides cheating?

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.041
- Sounds like a warning.
- He doesn't want to talk about cheating.

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.011
Uh…

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.780
Being lied to.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.481
Yeah, of course.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.518
Yeah. In my opinion,

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.654
even if it's hard to say,

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:07.894
it's better to be honest
about something rather than lie about it.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.062
Yeah, I hate lies too.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.332
Because when you lie,
it destroys the trust.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.368
You don't know what to believe.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.640
- But there are times when you have to lie.
- That's true.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.775
Maybe it's the lies
that make the world interesting.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:23.709
Yeah.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:27.513
I think the kind of person
I'd really like as my next partner

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.716
is someone with experience.

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:35.121
And I know this might sound weird,
but when I was younger,

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.824
I always preferred someone
who didn't have much experience

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.026
or hadn't been influenced too much.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.663
But now I want someone with experience.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.832
Someone who is tired of playing around.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.767
- Someone who's serious.
- Mmm.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.902
I might feel more reassured.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.472
- I know that's also what I'm looking for.
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.407
- You don't want the excitement anymore.
- Exactly.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.375
- You don't. You really don't.
- Yeah, you're right.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.412
Mmm.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.215
Mmm.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.153
I'll work on my legs now.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.356
{\an8}MARKETER AT MANUFACTURING COMPANY

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.961
- Thirty minutes, right?
- If you're going to the bath.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.829
{\an8}- You're not going, right?
- No, I'm not.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.598
{\an8}Izaya and William are going, you know.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.899
Take a bath.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.602
- I don't want to. Go!
- That's true.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.872
If those two are taking a bath,
they can go first. I don't really want to.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.340
I'm planning to go, though.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.842
I'll finish in 30 minutes, then.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.511
This'll be an intense session.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.279
Lately, I've been working out

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.115
just to get jacked up before going
to the sauna or the bath.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.417
- Oh!
- It's really pointless.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.628
I like push-ups.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:50.830
Hey.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.968
- See you later.
- Uh-huh.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:59.071
Enjoy the gym. Bye-bye.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.949
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.286
- It's okay.
- We going to the bath?

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.154
- Thinking about it.
- Yeah.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.556
Okay, so, let's go.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.291
You don't want to?

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:23.796
What time is it now?

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:27.033
It's around 4:30. Maybe 4:35.

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.002
- You wanna stay here?
- Mmm.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.504
- You don't wanna go?
- Huh?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.339
You don't want to go?

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.942
- Izaya, do you want to go?
- Maybe not today.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.277
You don't wanna go? Why not?

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.447
- Well, we don't have much time.
- Oh, is that why?

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.857
I'm sorry I made you rush in the gym.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:54.460
It's okay. If you're not going,
I'll go back to the gym.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.696
- Is Kazuyuki working out?
- Yeah, he's not going.

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.531
- You should go.
- Yeah, you should go.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.399
So you're not going today? Okay.

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.201
- Let's go another time.
- Let's.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.136
- We can go whenever.
- Okay.

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.074
So, as I was saying…

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.011
Oh, that's tough for Jobu.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:16.549
That is tough. Jobu has been
going through a lot of tough experiences.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:23.189
- They're no longer going.
- Neither one?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.559
- Because it's late?
- Maybe.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.694
Maybe they didn't feel like it.

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.229
I feel so bad.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.698
They were having a serious conversation.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.567
- Really?
- Mmm.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:38.104
- They were, while preparing dinner.
- A serious conversation?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.940
They looked real serious, so I don't
know what they were talking about.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.476
But they were like, "Maybe not today."

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.113
"Okay… no problem."

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.482
That's what happened.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:52.785
I don't know what they were talking about.

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:55.121
Okay.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:08.034
I think my previous experience
has made me a little anxious.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.804
Or, should I say,
it's made me cautious of people.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:15.107
- Hmm.
- Now I think twice before dating anyone.

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:18.344
Mm-hmm. That's understandable.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:23.115
I was wondering, what would make you feel
you could take a step forward?

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.987
- I have no idea what would make me.
- Mmm.

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.293
It's trust, right? I need
to prove to him that he can trust me.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.162
Therefore, from now on,

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:39.432
I need to figure out
the best way to approach William

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:42.201
so he can understand how serious I am.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:47.773
To do that, I think that
the best way is to show him my true self.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.741
Mm-hmm.

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.343
{\an8}YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.345
{\an8}- Yeah, he's right.
- Mmm.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.515
{\an8}I did feel sorry for Jobu just now.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.050
- It made my chest hurt.
- Yeah.

00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:01.053
{\an8}- He got jacked up for nothing.
- He was all sweaty, too.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.023
{\an8}Yeah. Even William was like,
"Why don't you go to the gym?"

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.926
{\an8}- That was so sad.
- To hear someone say "You go" is tough.

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.228
{\an8}Well, they were having
a pretty serious conversation,

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.931
{\an8}even if Jobu suddenly appeared
all jacked up out of nowhere.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.500
{\an8}- I understand why they'd say, "Not now".
- I guess so.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.603
{\an8}- That's what happened.
- That was difficult to watch.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.004
Miss, today, you're…

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.539
- What is it?
- Oh.

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:22.241
You're really dressed up today.

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:24.043
- You're right!
- What?

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.978
- Oh, I didn't notice.
- It's impressive!

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.580
Your wig is really impressive.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:29.281
- I'm flattered.
- Amazing!

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:31.784
Now I finally feel like
I have time to catch my breath.

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.819
Oh, good. So you were feeling restless?

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.888
Up until now, it felt
like I was trying to show off.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.823
- I felt embarrassed.
- Oh, stop!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.860
- You look so glamorous. Fabulous.
- You look wonderful.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:41.794
Thank you very much.

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:45.564
So, regarding the reason William
cheated in his past relationship.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.167
- Is kissing considered cheating?
- Oh my.

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.070
- I don't know. If he kissed someone…
- Yeah.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.672
- I don't know if that's cheating.
- Right.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.075
- I don't like it.
- It would make you sulk a little.

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:57.843
Izaya was also leaning
on the gym equipment,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.246
like, "You're never getting
away from me."

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.815
{\an8}He was staring at him so intensely
through the mirror.

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.951
William said, "Not a big deal."
Izaya's like, "Yes, it is."

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.820
Earlier, we were watching the episode.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.556
- You said we didn't need the truth.
- That's right, you did.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.258
Right? Do you really think so?

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:15.427
Yeah, I really think so. For example,
you know,

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:18.397
if you want to know
absolutely everything about your partner,

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.600
then you would have to look through
their cell phone and everything they own.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:25.471
You have to accept that there are things
you don't know about, and that's fine.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:29.742
If you try to uncover everything
that is hidden in your partner's life,

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.545
it'll never end,
so you need to consciously realize that.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.546
- Yes.
- True.

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:37.082
If you know 60 or 70%
of who they are, that's enough.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.351
The leftover percentage is
made up by trusting them.

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.120
- I get it.
- Wow!

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.688
- That sounds good!
- I agree.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.456
Excuse me, some white wine, please?

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:46.025
That sounds great!

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.828
- Beautiful.
- Wow!

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.530
Love and snow really do go well together.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.171
{\an8}Your eyebrows are light.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:02.474
- Those two joke around like that.
- Yeah, they seem pretty close.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.643
- You should draw them.
- I'll draw them.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.213
- Draw them?
- Yeah. You have to tell the barber.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.048
- I tell them right away.
- I was surprised.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.016
I tell them not to trim them.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.952
If you don't tell them,
they make them thinner.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:15.054
- I ask them not to trim my facial hair.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.489
- Who'll do it?
- I've never drawn eyebrows.

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:20.559
I'm good at drawing eyebrows.
Your skin is super smooth. Seriously.

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:23.329
- Yeah, it's so smooth.
- You don't have any wrinkles.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:26.198
- I thought so too.
- That's really amazing.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.133
- Are you drawing them?
- Yeah.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.603
I wanna draw the right eyebrow!

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:31.570
One side each?

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:34.440
You have no taste.

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.909
No, I'm just getting started.
Isn't this how you do it?

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.510
Oh, looking good.

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.013
Okay, look over here.
Look over here. Okay.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.982
- You see? You see?
- It looks good.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:47.152
But I can definitely do better.
I have a certain style in mind for you.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.488
- Oh, really? But…
- Wait, what is it?

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.458
- A style?
- It won't suit me!

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:55.227
- A certain style!
- Make sure it's even.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.529
- Keep the balance.
- So, this part, the start, is important.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.431
- The start of the eyebrows right.
- Yeah!

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.700
But the eyebrows!

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.603
- Starts thicker.
- Bolder?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.172
- Both brows are uneven?
- Totally uneven.

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.644
They look like Sei Shonagon's eyebrows.

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.813
Wait a second. This might help a little.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.550
No, no, no.
The start of the eyebrow looks weird.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:22.554
Let's have him decide
which one he likes better.

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:24.223
Face this way properly.

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.727
- Cute!
- It's pretty bad.

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.095
I'll take a picture for you.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.730
- It's bad.
- This is bad.

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:33.232
This way, face this way.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.071
- Hey, it looks super delicious.
- Yeah. It tastes good.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.273
No way this doesn't taste good.

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.977
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:48.314
- Mm, it's good.
- Delicious.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.749
{\an8}- You like Kazu's mom's soup?
- It's good.

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.651
{\an8}- Kazu's mom's soup?
- It's delicious.

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.388
- It's okay.
- It's good! The miso soup is super good.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.123
- Good.
- Kazu's soup?

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.893
- There's a bit of sugar in it.
- So that's it!

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.530
B.T.C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.098
No way!

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:09.001
- Someone new!
- Yes, yes!

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.703
- Now?
- Nice!

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:17.409
- It's a lot of rice today. A bit too much.
- It's a bit too much.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.244
It's a new bodybuilding diet?

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.984
- A new member. How exciting!
- Hey, isn't he handsome?

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.653
- Sorry, I served too much rice.
- Not at all.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.755
- Did you serve the rice, Bomi?
- Yeah.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.558
- Too much.
- You only apologized at the end.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.927
I know.
I thought I could get away with it.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:45.437
- We made eight cups of rice.
- Is it gone?

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:46.538
Is all the rice gone?

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.140
- No.
- Oh.

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.175
You really cooked a lot.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.344
If there's any left,
someone can have it for breakfast.

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.114
- Yeah, of course.
- We'll eat it, don't worry.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.582
Good evening.

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:58.584
Huh?

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.089
I'm Ryuki, and I'll be
living with you, starting today.

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.257
- Now?
- Hi, guys.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:06.792
He's the cute type!

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.794
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to be here.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.896
- Glad to have you.
- Welcome in!

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.965
- We didn't know.
- What a surprise!

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:16.301
This is so unexpected.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:20.706
{\an8}I'm Ryuki, I'm 20.
I'm in my second year of college.

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.474
{\an8}I work part-time at a café.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:27.112
{\an8}My most recent relationship
was pretty painful.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:32.317
What I'm looking to do here
is regain the trust I lost in guys.

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:36.422
I want to talk to different people

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:39.158
and develop my way of thinking.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:43.595
I hope this will help me
take a step forward

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:47.332
towards what I hope will be a new start.

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:53.272
I think my dad would be really sad
about not being able to see my kids.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.873
I think he'd be disappointed.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.644
- Take a seat.
- Excuse me.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.546
- Excuse me.
- Stuff like this happens?

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.948
- Huwei seems…
- There's something going on.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.284
- They know each other.
- Do they?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.820
- I came from Osaka.
- Osaka?

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.988
Another person from Kansai.

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.491
- Strange timing?
- Someone new?

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:13.659
Strange timing.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.527
- I'm Jobu.
- Hi.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.629
Jobu. I'm from Osaka too.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.332
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm William.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:22.000
- I'm Izaya.
- Hi.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:24.703
- Uh, I'm Kazuyuki. I'm from Osaka.
- Hi.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.538
- Hi, I'm Bomi.
- Nice to meet you.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:29.675
- I'm Hiroya. I'm from Osaka.
- So many people from Osaka.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.745
- Do you two…
- We've hung out together before.

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.848
- Oh, really?
- With Huwei?

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:36.748
You two hung out?

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:39.485
I wouldn't call it hanging out.
We just went out for dinner.

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:40.919
- That's right.
- Yeah.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.656
We just went out to dinner twice.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:49.328
And after that, we were like,
"See you again soon."

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:52.831
But then he kept ghosting me,
and it's been like that until now.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.000
So, yeah, it was a little awkward.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.635
I was like, "What are you doing here?"

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:58.237
And the other thing is that

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.940
I didn't get a chance to meet
very many new people last year,

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:07.045
so the fact that two of them have ended
up here has taken me by surprise.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.815
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.550
Wow, you're so young!

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.186
- He's the youngest now.
- You're right, he is.

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.488
You look a bit like…

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.559
I can't believe he's half…
he's half my age.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.829
- Yeah, he's half your age.
- That's so crazy.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.231
- Don't be so nervous.
- I'm super nervous.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.033
- Understandable.
- I really am.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.301
It'll be okay.

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:31.003
- Right.
- We should have a toast.

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.804
- He hasn't had dinner yet.
- Oh.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:35.140
- Let's give him something.
- You haven't?

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.611
I could make more oyakodon.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:40.812
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.481
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.851
That was a big surprise, wasn't it?

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:54.660
- You must be nervous.
- I'm so nervous I can't talk.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.896
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thanks.

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:59.565
Here. Welcome to the Green Room.

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.266
Welcome to the Green Room!

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.402
Cheers!

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.206
Champagne and oyakodon don't go together.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.309
- They don't.
- But this is good.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.045
- It's delicious.
- Oh no, he's flustered.

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.013
Oh my gosh, he's flustered!

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.848
Is it good?

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.084
- It's very good.
- I'm glad.

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.954
What's up with you two?

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:24.656
What do you mean? What?

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.694
- You're so nosy.
- No, I mean, I'm just curious.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.997
- Nothing. We just had dinner.
- You just had dinner.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.232
Hmm.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.000
Do you remember what you ate?

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.369
Um, it was Italian, right? Yeah.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.571
Hmm.

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.840
Did you make the reservation, Huwei?

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.775
- There was no reservation.
- Not really.

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:46.311
It was kind of
a spontaneous dinner, wasn't it?

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.180
Yeah.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.253
- When did you go?
- Hmm?

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.687
When did you go out to eat?

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.389
Um…

00:20:58.457 --> 00:20:59.891
In September.

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.095
- And December.
- December?

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:06.098
And yet you left me
waiting for a dinner invite,

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:08.567
Even though you said, "Let's go."

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.235
- Aah!
- Well, whatever.

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.971
- So that's what happened.
- There, there. It happens.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.207
Seriously, too much information.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.575
They met twice.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.211
He said they met up twice for dinner.
He could've seen me.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:22.648
They had Italian food.
Who cares about what they ate?

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.217
But he didn't make a reservation.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.618
So I won there.

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:33.625
I don't know, maybe I do like Huwei.
I really don't know.

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.927
Yeah, it did make me a little jealous.

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.997
Ohh!

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:43.568
- A new member.
- Ryuki, about to shake things up.

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.237
And Hu-chan seemed pretty flustered

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.739
about seeing two of his ex-flirts
in the Green Room.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.809
- Understandably so.
- I'm surprised Huwei can get flustered.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:55.180
{\an8}We thought Hu-chan was the perfect human
being, after all. He's always so composed.

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:58.417
But with everything that happened,
he got champagne all over himself.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:02.854
- He spilled it.
- Maybe he had feelings for Ryuki?

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.891
They had dinner together twice.
He probably felt attracted to him,

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.893
and maybe asked him out a third time.

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:10.429
But he kept being ghosted
and was like, "What's going on?"

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:11.530
But now they've met again.

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:15.367
{\an8}And then Bomi is like,
"But he made a dinner reservation for me."

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.135
{\an8}- That was really cute.
- He was like, "I win!"

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.971
That was cute.

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:22.341
Now that he's the youngest
member of the group,

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:26.611
the fraternal relationships are
going to drastically change.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.680
For sure.
They were worried if he had eaten.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.449
They asked "Do you want something to eat?"

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:33.118
- All the attention focused on him.
- True.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.721
I wonder what Bomi,
the former youngest one, feels about this.

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:40.959
Yeah, and especially since he, too,
had something special going on with Hu.

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:44.096
I was impressed that everyone introduced
themselves pretty quickly.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:45.397
"Hiroya." "Jobu."

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:50.035
But Kazuyuki introduced himself carefully,
like, "I'm Kazuyuki."

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.604
- He's a wonderful human being.
- You're so observant.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.872
- I'm impressed.
- He is.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:57.642
- Wow! There's so much snow.
- Yeah, the weather is nice too.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:58.677
It's crazy!

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:01.380
Does it usually snow this much?
Hu, you can do throws.

00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:03.014
You can do shoulder throws.

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:05.283
- Doesn't look like it would hurt.
- Right?

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.887
- Let's do this.
- You ready?

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:13.258
Yaah!

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.672
No. Izaya, Izaya. Stop.
The two of us get Izaya.

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.574
We all get Izaya! We all get Izaya!

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:32.210
Aw, how cute!

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.546
- Nice.
- This is what youth is all about!

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:36.014
Ready, go!

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.221
What are you spacing out for?

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.963
- The way the snow flies up!
- It's nice.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.666
It's the winter version
of splashing water at the beach.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.268
- Exactly.
- I get it.

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.069
…feel it another time

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.939
No matter what
Don't you stay in the line

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.041
You'd better stay alive

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.744
And try to listen, listen, uh-oh

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.747
No matter what
Don't you stay in the line

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.749
You'd better stay alive

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:13.385
And try to listen, listen, uh-oh

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.222
Oh.

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.524
- Oh, here it is.
- How scary.

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:22.661
You should show him.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.165
Yeah. Press that.

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.000
Please read it aloud.

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:31.636
- "Good morning."
- Good morning.

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.739
"Here's the person on duty
for today's shift."

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:38.243
{\an8}- "For today, Kazuyuki will be on duty."
- Finally!

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.144
{\an8}Oh!

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:41.246
{\an8}Congratulations!

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:44.282
{\an8}I'm getting applause
just for being chosen.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.751
Okay.

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.654
- Hardest to guess.
- Yeah.

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:51.156
Who will it be?

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:52.757
So, who will it be?

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:54.860
If it's someone he's close to, it's Jobu.

00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:57.395
Or will he choose someone
he's interested in romantically?

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:58.897
Who will he choose?

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.903
- It's Jobu!
- Let's go.

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:07.772
I have no choice! Just kidding.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.175
- It's been a while. Let's do this.
- Have fun.

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:15.514
I will. Bye, everyone.

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:31.429
Do you think we can make 7,000 yen today?

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:32.430
We can do it.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:35.033
Okay, that's our goal.

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:38.770
If you really want
to enjoy the taste of coffee,

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:41.506
I would recommend the drip coffee, yeah.

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:44.242
The beans are carefully selected
and absolutely delicious.

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:46.711
- So please give the drip coffee a try!
- I see.

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:49.481
When it's ready,
I'll go like, "Beep, beep!"

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:50.515
Like, "Beep, beep, beep."

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:51.750
- Got it!
- Thanks.

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:54.386
- His skills are amazing.
- He's a great salesman.

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:56.087
He's really impressive.

00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.025
Excuse me, sorry for the wait.
Here's your chocolate milk.

00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:01.092
Thank you very much.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:03.595
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:06.097
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.400
- Eighteen cups?
- Isn't that a new record?

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:09.334
Maybe.

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:12.470
- Shall we close up?
- Yeah, good idea.

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:13.939
- See?
- Impressive!

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.707
TODAY'S SALES:
8,800 YEN

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.913
{\an8}WHAT'S EVERYONE UP TO?
DON'T GO TO THE SAUNA WITHOUT ME.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.482
{\an8}- He's texting.
- Is he texting William?

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:26.151
{\an8}- A group chat?
- Maybe.

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:27.752
Did they make a group chat?

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:33.525
I thought I could probably have the most
fun and best vibe with you, Jobu.

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:34.926
- That's true.
- Yeah.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.395
So, that's why I wanted to work with you.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.733
Last time, you went with Will.

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:43.935
Did you have a good talk?

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:46.571
I could only say about half
of what I wanted to say.

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:50.375
I always end up joking around
and laughing. I can't be serious.

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:53.345
- Say what I want to say in an honest way.
- Is it because you're embarrassed?

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:57.816
I think Will prefers serious things to be
discussed seriously in a serious context.

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.684
- Yeah, I got that impression too.
- Definitely.

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:02.454
So even if it's a little embarrassing,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.523
I think it might be best
to talk to him seriously.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.292
I have to talk to him seriously.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.794
Hmm, so I'm thinking
of talking to him today.

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:12.764
Tonight? What are you going
to tell him tonight?

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:13.832
Hmm?

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:18.003
- That I really like him.
- Oh, right, right.

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:20.739
I don't want things to end
without having said anything.

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:23.875
As far as I'm concerned,

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.845
I can't say that I've gotten
to that point either.

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.647
You're still too considerate.

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:32.317
Well, that's just normal for me.
Everyone has kind of started teasing me.

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.285
Oh yeah? Well, that's
a lot more playful, right?

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.021
- It's better.
- It's definitely better.

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:39.524
You know, among all the members,
you're the one I feel most at ease with.

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:40.725
Oh, that's good.

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.460
Older guys are easier to talk to.

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:44.863
They're easier to talk to,

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:49.034
and I think they're interesting
because they know things I don't know.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.636
Like, you were in a relationship
for 15 years.

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:54.205
- Yeah.
- I've never met anyone like you.

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:57.842
- I think that's amazing.
- 15 years passed before I realized it.

00:27:57.909 --> 00:28:00.945
But that's not easy to do.
I don't think it's easy to do.

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:04.449
- Especially for people like us.
- Yeah. I guess not.

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:08.253
A new relationship,
it'd be nice if that could happen.

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.021
Do you like someone?

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:13.992
Hmm, no, I… I haven't thought
about it that much, not in that sense.

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.761
- But you haven't given up?
- No.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.930
Then that's fine.
If you think you don't have a chance,

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.398
you have to stop thinking like that.

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.800
Mmm, mmm.

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:25.136
Well, yes, I do hope it happens.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.838
Good. Then that's fine.

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:29.908
You have two months
to focus your thoughts on this.

00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:33.144
With two months,
you can think about a lot of things.

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.859
William and I are going
to step out for a bit.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.828
- Okay.
- Be right back.

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.196
See you later, guys.

00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:57.135
- Where are we going?
- Just over there.

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.770
- Outside?
- Outside.

00:28:58.837 --> 00:28:59.838
To the igloo?

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.207
Oh, do you think so?

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.509
Close the blinds properly.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.080
This way.

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:10.949
Ta-da!

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:14.119
What is this? It's super nice.
Oh, there are even lights!

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.690
- This is our first date in an igloo.
- Oh, it's cute.

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:20.959
- After you.
- He called it a date.

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:22.560
- Yeah.
- He sure did.

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:25.063
- Yeah.
- It's my first time. Can we fit?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.198
We can fit. Watch your step.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.967
- Oh!
- Are you in?

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:34.172
- Wow! This is nice.
- It's not that cold.

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:35.507
- It's not cold!
- Right?

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.642
- It won't collapse, will it?
- It won't.

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:40.278
- This is awesome.
- I know, right?

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:42.413
So this is what you worked so hard on.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.382
Yeah, I worked hard
shaving the snow like this.

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:49.020
Because I wanted to go in here with you.

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:51.489
I was thinking of you while digging away.

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:54.392
- During all that time?
- Of course.

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:57.295
So, since the weather's been nice lately,

00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:00.632
I thought it might melt and
we wouldn't be able to come here,

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:01.833
and I would really regret it.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.368
So I wanted to ask you out quickly.

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.703
Oh, I get it.
That's what was on your mind?

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.005
That was on my mind.

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:11.543
I was worried someone else might want
to come here with you for the first time.

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.812
Your first time,
I wanted to be with you for that.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.717
I didn't want someone else to take you
first. That was on my mind too.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:22.453
I want to take action
when the idea comes to me.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:26.891
So, that's why I asked you out quickly.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.035
I'm happy, but…

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:43.007
Um, I don't know, but people who do that
kind of thing do it to everyone, you know?

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:46.377
People who are good at keeping in touch
are the same with everyone.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:48.913
I only do it with people I like.

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.015
No way.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.418
Of course it's true.

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:58.957
You're still a shadow
I know you are there

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.192
I'll be waiting for

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.761
I'll be waiting for you

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:06.197
Now hold my hand, I promise…

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:09.734
I wonder what exactly
is so great about me.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:10.768
Hmm.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.105
How should I put it?

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:17.508
I guess everything.

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:21.880
Like the way you express your feelings

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.116
without holding anything back.

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:26.918
I really like that about you.

00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:30.588
I like you. Yeah, I like you.

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:33.291
Oops, I said it. Oh well. And…

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.629
With love

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:40.531
I can change the sky above

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:43.201
You have a surprisingly
sensitive side too.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:47.405
And rise a little higher

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:51.142
Until the truth is…

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:55.280
I'm looking at everything about you.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.288
But the thing that scares me
is the way things are progressing.

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:07.025
Or, should I say, the speed
at which things are progressing.

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.761
That's what makes me a little nervous.

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:14.232
I worry a lot about
whether I can live up to your feelings.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.036
I'm concerned that your emotions
are getting ahead of you,

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:21.606
that they're spilling over,
and that you're letting things slip out,

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:25.310
just like you accidentally
let your feelings slip out earlier.

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:26.210
Hmm.

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:30.048
It's not like I feel pressure, but…

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:36.921
I do want to meet your feelings,
of course, but I'm conflicted.

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:42.226
Well, with regards to that, I obviously
don't want you to feel pressured at all.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.497
All I really want is for you to think
things through

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:50.969
as we share moments together
and spend time here together.

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:53.604
I want you to be with me…

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:55.840
Thank you. I was surprised.

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:57.608
- You were surprised?
- Yeah.

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.510
- I'm happy.
- Are you happy?

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:02.347
Are you embarrassed?

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.515
I know you are there

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:06.985
I'll be waiting for

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:09.320
I'll be waiting for you

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:10.989
Now hold my hand

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:13.024
I promise that, that…

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:17.028
Wow, the lights are amazing.
Were they always here?

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:20.098
- Yeah.
- Maybe I never noticed.

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:25.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! My sweater's caught.

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:30.274
Huh? Wow, it feels like
there's no one here.

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:33.945
Hello, guys, welcome back.

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.314
- Welcome back.
- Hi. We're back.

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.082
- Hello.
- Here they are.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.084
Where are the others?

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.988
- Where are the other two?
- They went somewhere.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.524
- Said they had something to do.
- Oh, I see.

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:49.360
Could you grab the oil for me, please?

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:52.330
- Oh! No! Don't go there!
- He's going to see them.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.765
We should clean up?

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:56.968
Yeah, let's clean up, since
there's nothing else for us to do here.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.471
There's not much… Oh!

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:03.141
What?

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:07.979
They're having a chat.

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.581
That's such a great place to talk.

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:22.360
- Was it fun?
- It was fun.

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.494
That's good.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:26.130
About the cake flour,
maybe we don't need it.

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:28.066
Just give me some regular flour.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.734
Mix it with water.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.470
If you need me to clean
that up, I'd like to do it.

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.639
- [Yeah, let's clean it up.
- Okay.

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:40.144
Okay, shall we wash up?

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:54.492
We're back.

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.961
- Oh, they're back.
- They're back!

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:59.330
- We're just cleaning up.
- How'd it go?

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:01.299
- It was fun.
- It went well and it was fun.

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.900
Was it fun? Did you fight?

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:05.536
We'll fight later.

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:08.840
- Looking forward to your stories.
- Yes, with pleasure.

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:11.042
- Our stories.
- Our stories.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.246
This thing is getting a lot of
bubbles in between these things.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:18.916
- Should we still use this towel?
- What did we use it for?

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:21.319
Um, it was on the trash can.

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.454
He's really discouraged.
He can't stand up.

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.690
- He has to lean on the wall.
- He's really down.

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.792
- You still gonna talk to him?
- Hm?

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.494
- Are you gonna talk to him?
- No way.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.162
- Why not?
- I won't talk to him.

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:32.897
You're kidding. Why not?

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.200
- There's no time.
- Not true.

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.240
I think you should talk to him.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.042
- You'll regret it if you don't.
- No way.

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:52.717
- Pork miso soup?
- Pork miso soup.

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:53.851
It's really good.

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:57.355
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.458
This looks good.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.660
It's a complete pork miso soup.

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.128
How were your sales?

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.865
- Today, we made 8,800 yen!
- Wow, that's amazing!

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:10.101
- Amazing.
- That the highest sales so far.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:12.003
- It is.
- You broke the record.

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:14.205
- We broke the record with 18 cups. Was it?
- Yeah.

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.439
- Amazing!
- 18 cups?

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.408
Okay, tell us. What's your secret?

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.177
- Our vibe?
- Our vibe.

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.645
- Vibe?
- That's great.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.247
What did you guys do?

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:26.484
Well, we shoveled snow.

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.286
- And we shoveled snow.
- I see.

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:31.722
And then,
all three of us went to the sauna.

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.157
An impulse decision?

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.358
It was.

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:37.628
- He got shirtless on his second day here.
- It was nice. I was shirtless.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:40.631
They went even though he texted them.

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:42.099
The truth comes out!

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:43.801
- Did you talk?
- I think so.

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:45.503
- You talked, right?
- Yeah.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.771
{\an8}SEEN BY: BOMI, HIROYA, KAZUYUKI

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:47.905
{\an8}It went by so fast.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:50.274
{\an8}It was a good opportunity to talk to Ryu.

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.609
{\an8}True.

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.477
{\an8}- He's "Ryu" now?
- Yeah.

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.546
{\an8}- Really?
- Yeah, we call him Ryu.

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.748
- It's easier.
- Please call me Ryu.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.386
I thought you were doing
a coffee training session with Ryuki.

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.822
- We did that.
- We did that after you left.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.557
- Sorry, I forgot.
- We did.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:10.194
- He wasn't a beginner. He had experience.
- Yeah, he did.

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:12.530
- Of course.
- He picked it up right away.

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.764
He does latte art.

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:16.367
- He's ready for work.
- I can feel the pressure!

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.605
Yeah, don't worry.

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:24.075
This is so painful.

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:28.012
- I know.
- Yeah, this is so sad.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.314
- I'd go to my room and cry.
- I'd cry.

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.550
- I would totally cry.
- I can feel his pain.

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.785
Maybe, by the time Jobu sent that text,

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:37.488
they had already decided to go
to the sauna, or had already gone.

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:40.057
It could be something as simple
as what you're saying,

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:45.096
but the fact is that Jobu still felt
a little left out of the group activities.

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:47.431
And then he comes back
and sees the two of them,

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:49.500
chatting away outside,
all cozy in the igloo.

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:51.102
That's a double-strike to the morale.

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:53.337
It's hard enough to see
the person you like

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:55.973
walking around town with someone else.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.375
But they're in the igloo together!

00:37:57.441 --> 00:38:00.111
- My jaw would literally hit the floor.
- It's so cozy!

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:02.546
It's too much, It's way too shocking.

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.548
The igloo might be destroyed
the next morning.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:06.017
Absolutely.

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:08.953
- Jobu could hit it with a shovel.
- "Take that! Yeah!"

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.855
- In the middle of the night.
- He might.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.661
- This person is really cute too.
- Who was it again?

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:19.730
This person is the cute type,
unlike the previous one.

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:22.066
Oh, have you watched the TV show?

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:24.335
- Smiley, right? Yeah!
- Smiley!

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:26.837
What's Smiley?
There's a TV drama called Smiley.

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:29.273
- TV drama? A gay drama?
- Set in Barcelona.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.676
- I see.
- Set in Barcelona. It's cute!

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:35.146
- Super cute.
- This drama made me like this person.

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:38.082
But these people probably have
their own thing going on, right?

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.518
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah, who knows? Probably.

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:44.188
Their own issues,
or non-issues, more likely

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:52.697
Wait, who was that?

00:38:57.601 --> 00:39:00.471
He's done it now. Yep, that did it.

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:03.674
Nothing good ever comes
from looking at someone's phone.

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.609
- Learn from season one.
- Never look!

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.812
- Leave it in your room.
- You see Izaya's face?

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:13.451
- Once I start, I do a bit every day.
- What's on your mind?

00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:15.252
- Hmm?
- What's on your mind?

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:17.755
- Why?
- Because you're like this.

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:18.789
Izaya] Hmm.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.559
Hmm. It's nothing.

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:33.471
I was looking at William's phone with him,
and he received a heart emoji.

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:36.474
And I was taken by surprise.

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.944
I couldn't help but jump to the conclusion

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.180
that he probably has
multiple connections like that.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.084
Mmm.

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.087
It's like, you know…

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.824
- This is tough.
- Huh?

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.025
It's tough.

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.139
It was a text someone sent me.

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:10.975
It was from someone
I used to message with.

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:13.244
A person from my past,
meaning that it's someone I knew

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.179
before I came here to the Green Room.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.115
Nothing at all has happened
since I got here.

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.284
If you want,
you can even look at the dates.

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.522
- No more looking at phones!
- Come on!

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:00.491
Please turn your phones off.

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:03.527
- Or better, throw them away. Am I right?
- He should turn it off.

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:06.263
When you're looking at your phone
with someone, you get a text!

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.233
{\an8}- It's scary. You're so right.
- That's so true.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.268
It's like destiny is
playing a trick on you.

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.838
Understandably, Izaya started sulking

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:16.073
and decided to go back to his room.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.875
I understand why he did.

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:20.544
But the mood got so dark
and negative once again.

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:23.581
I'm sure William feels
somehow responsible for that.

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.316
- And they're not dating yet.
- Yeah.

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:27.384
- They're not dating yet.
- Exactly.

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:29.520
And until now, he's been holding it in.

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:32.790
But then the words "It's tough"
finally slipped out, and we knew.

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:36.393
I think that's how William has always
felt, all along, from the beginning.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.328
Yeah.

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:50.241
- Is everyone leaving?
- I'm leaving.

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.309
- We should sleep.
- Going to bed.

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:55.579
What is it?

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.215
Do you mind if we talk for a bit?

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.450
I don't mind at all.

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:01.619
Goodnight.

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.654
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:05.456
See you tomorrow.

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:11.428
Well, actually,
I had made up my mind yesterday.

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:14.565
I was planning on having
a private chat with you today.

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:16.734
- Really?
- Yeah, I was…

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:21.605
Okay, wait, I'm really not good
at talking one-on-one like this.

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:24.275
You probably noticed that
when we talked last time.

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:25.476
Yeah, I did notice.

00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:29.613
Yeah, I've never had the experience of
sharing my feelings one-on-one like this,

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.448
so I'm not very good at this at all.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.018
Yeah, and, um…

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.120
What I want to say is…

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.823
I'm really attracted to you.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.894
Um, you have a very unique charm
that attracts me.

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.631
You have a playful side
and like to have fun.

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:51.068
When you take the time to explain
and talk about your work,

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.404
you talk about it with passion,

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.675
and I think people who are passionate
about the work they do

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.843
are cool in so many ways.

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:04.081
I wanted to let you know
I'm really attracted to you.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:08.018
- Thank you.
- Sure!

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.654
I don't know if "thank you"
is the right thing to say, but…

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.022
I'm glad I told you.

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:17.428
Well, I'm kind of confused after
having talked about so many things.

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.329
Of course.

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:22.199
Yeah, I'm being chosen by two people.

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:25.669
I know that this might sound weird.

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:28.772
- But I knew Izaya before here.
- Yeah.

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:33.310
So, yeah, and I actually have
a past with him.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:34.712
Izaya and I.

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.513
- I see.
- So, there's that.

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:39.783
We didn't just meet up once or
twice casually with some friends.

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:45.055
When I went out with Izaya,
we actually went out on proper dates.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.494
- Then it kind of faded away.
- Mmm.

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:53.130
But I was the one who initiated that.

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:55.132
Izaya just accepted it.

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:59.269
Honestly, I don't remember
what the reason was.

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:03.240
But when I ran the truck with Izaya,

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:06.410
he told me how he felt,
and from that moment,

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.545
the way I look at Izaya changed.

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:11.382
Yeah. But to be honest, I'm still trying

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:13.751
to work through my feelings,

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.487
and I'm still very unsure.

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:17.621
You don't know.

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:21.358
But I know I can't face
both of you at the same time.

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:22.292
Mmm.

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:38.342
Thank you.

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.943
Yes, thank you.

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:44.181
- We should go to sleep.
- Let's go to sleep.

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.697
Oh.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.401
Let's see.

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:17.040
- "Good morning."
- Good morning.

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:21.345
{\an8}"You will now be going
on a one-on-one date."

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.513
{\an8}Huh?

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.816
{\an8}- For real?
- I see.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:28.118
{\an8}- That's sudden.
- What? All of a sudden?

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:29.987
{\an8}Okay, then.

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:34.424
{\an8}"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on a piece of paper."

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.493
{\an8}"You can only go on a date
if your feelings,

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.763
{\an8}and the feelings of the person
you've chosen, are mutual."

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:20.163
- What? No way!
- Wait a minute. Hey!

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.665
- Don't end here!
- Not fair!

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.767
- This is unbearable!
- This is awful!

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:26.503
- This is unbearable!
- They really like doing this, hey?

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:30.574
- A date night, with all that's going on?
- It's too much.

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.777
Damn, every cell in my body
is just freaking out now!

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:36.213
With so much happening,
you can't help but freak out.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.548
- It's overwhelming!
- They really did it this time. Right?

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:42.719
{\an8}So, Jobu asked to speak to William,
said he had something to say,

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.588
{\an8}and confessed his feelings.

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:47.224
{\an8}- What's your take on this, sensei?
- What's your take?

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:50.093
{\an8}It's not easy being approached
by two people at once.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.962
{\an8}So, if he's not into Jobu
in the first place,

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.830
{\an8}he wants to shut it down right away.

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:54.932
{\an8}Oh!

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:57.000
{\an8}But William is a happy kind of person,

00:48:57.067 --> 00:49:00.037
{\an8}and I think he's really uncomfortable
turning people down.

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:01.104
{\an8}I see.

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:06.743
{\an8}So, in my opinion, I think he might have
used the whole past situation with Izaya

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.947
{\an8}as an excuse to make it easier
for him to say no to Jobu.

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:14.384
{\an8}- That's based on your own experience?
- Oh no! What gave me away?

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:17.487
{\an8}- It was the passion.
- So intense.

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:19.756
{\an8}- You hit the nail on the head.
- It was very deep.

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.325
{\an8}That's how it looked to me.

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:25.228
{\an8}It didn't seem like he wanted
to deal with either of them, to be honest.

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:28.031
{\an8}He's already having a hard time
dealing with Izaya,

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:30.801
{\an8}and after what's happened,
I don't think there's any chance left.

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.336
No!

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:33.804
That's what I think.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.106
Do you think
I'm turning into a bad person?

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.575
Most definitely.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.210
- You're very convincing.
- Yeah.

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:42.012
I can tell you've been through this.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.514
- We know it's true.
- It's based on your experience.

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:46.483
To understand a criminal, ask a criminal.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.719
You're absolutely right.
