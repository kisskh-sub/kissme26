{\an8}Nice.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.124

- Yes!
- What should we do?

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.967
Aren't you going to celebrate?

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.070
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.448
I wonder why he chose
to go on a date with Izaya.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.118
- You're right.
- Maybe there wasn't anyone else.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.152
Yeah, that's it.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.990
- We're off.
- See you later.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.826
- See you later.
- Have fun.

- Yeah, we're stuck here, as usual.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.444
- As usual.
- As usual.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.595
- "Think easy," she said
- She said

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.898
"Forever young and so wild"

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:48.067
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.738
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:57.544
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.680
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.182
Maybe

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.084
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.819
- We're blind, blind
- Blind

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.889
- How'd we get air all this time?
- This time

These things

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.726
I never thought when you were mine

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.296
We used to break it together

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.264
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:22.869
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.538
Are we growing older together?

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.507
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:32.178
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.081

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:47.126
{\an8}You know,
it's pretty rare to see a landscape

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.729
{\an8}so completely white nowadays.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:50.997
{\an8}Mm.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.705
- Ooh, wow!
- Wow, amazing.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.442
It's entirely made out of ice, right?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.844
Amazing.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.180
Oh, an ice bar.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.450
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.417
Hello.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:15.488
- This is how you make these, right?
- Yes, that's right. Cocktail glasses.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.390
Triangles and other shapes.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.370
That's big.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.717
Well, what do you think?

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.119
- Yeah. It's good.
- Yeah?

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:51.958
Cheers.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.295
- It's good.
- Mm.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:12.111
- Okay, shall we?
- Yeah, let's walk around a little.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.613
- Good idea.
- Mm.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.551
The mood is heavy between them.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:21.187
They're on a date,
but they're not talking, right?

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.221
Let's go.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.724
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.293
{\an8}- Who did you pick?
- I had picked William.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.196
{\an8}What are your… thoughts about that?

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.398
I can work in the coffee truck
with anyone.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.434
- I get it.
- I didn't mind going with someone else.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.870
But when choosing a date,
I realized I wanted to go with William.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.039
I didn't overthink it.
I just wrote his name.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:40.940
Mm.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.610
At first,
I thought Huwei had feelings for Izaya.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.645
I'm sure he does.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.883
So naturally, I thought Huwei would try
to sort out his feelings for Izaya first.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.387
That's why I thought,
"Fine, sort out your feelings for Izaya."

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:58.725
But I was able to tell him he was the one
I was interested in, out of everyone.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.960
And Bomi likes Huwei too, right?

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.128
Mm, probably.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.032
Yeah, and Huwei decided to choose Bomi
as his date.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.168
He didn't choose Izaya,
and he obviously didn't choose me.

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:10.536
- Yeah.
- He chose Bomi.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.006
So I was like, 'Oh, I get it.'

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.778
- I really wanted to go.
- Of course you did.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.646
Arf!

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.248
Womp womp.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.317
- How cute.
- He's cute.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.418
That's so cute.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.820
I don't care anymore.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.790
I won't do anything today.
I won't even make dinner tonight.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.360
That gives a bad impression.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.530
- Come on, let's make dinner.
- Okay.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.599
I like how Jobu stays positive.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.101
Yeah, he was funny
when he said "arf" like that.

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:49.609
- Are you still angry?
- Hmm?

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:55.314
If I'm angry? I think I might be feeling
something a little different than anger.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.517
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's like…

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.018
Um…

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.454
It's complicated.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:03.723
You know?

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:16.302
This is nice.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:22.742
Hmm.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.111
It's so tense.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:26.779
It's really tense.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.489
Something still bothering you?

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.090
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:42.962
I really have… mixed feelings
about what happened.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.331
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday.

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.499
Mm.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:50.369
I mean, it's not like our relationship has

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:52.939
developed into anything yet.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:56.576
That's why I don't think
it's right for me to get mad.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.477
Mm.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:58.377
But

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.413
it does

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.348
make me nervous.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:03.683
Mm.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.921
Yes, it was someone
I used to be in touch with.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.124
But… I didn't contact him at all,

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:15.228
not when I'm focused on someone else.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.964
I really don't want you to worry
about things like that.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.031
Mm-hmm.

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.701
I think you're an honest person, William,

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:24.036
and that you wouldn't lie
about something like that,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.204
so I'm not worried.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.139
No, I'm not lying.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.774
Mm.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.312
But it's possible you could get
more messages like that

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:34.814
in the future, right?

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.685
When that happens, I wonder,
what's the best way for us to handle it?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:44.056
Should I ask about it when it happens
until I'm satisfied with the answer?

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.025
I think so, yeah, until you're satisfied.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:51.197
You can always tell me how you feel,
and I'll always give you an honest answer.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.300
I don't want this to be a problem for us.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.169
- Yeah, neither do I.
- Mm.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.439
Hey, look at the view.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:04.143
- It's amazing.
- I didn't notice it.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.411
You're right.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.415
With love

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:14.620
I can change the sky above…

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.123
It's amazing.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.824
It's like

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.361
all the fog has lifted,

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:26.799
and now I can finally see
the whole view clearly.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:29.502
With love

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:34.173
I can change the sky above

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.676
And rise a little higher…

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.044
I'm happy.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.284
- Our memorable first time.
- Our first date.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.621
It's a little bittersweet though.

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.891
You know, that kind of incident
could possibly happen again.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.759
Mm. Well, if it does,

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:56.295
I really want us to talk it out

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:59.231
and to work towards
finding the best solution…

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:00.900
for both of us.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:01.968
Mm.

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:05.104
That's how relationships
move forward, after all.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.440
You're right. That kind of relationship

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.711
is really important…
when building a future with someone.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.447
Yeah. I think so.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.249
I guess today was

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.885
a really important day.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.455
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.790
I want you to be with me…

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.459
- Shall we?
- Let's head back.

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.327
Yeah. Everyone's waiting.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.261
Yeah.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:30.763
Let's go.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.633
You're still a shadow…

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.668
The snow's so fluffy and pretty.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:38.804
I'll be waiting for

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.173
I'll be waiting for you

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.742
Now hold my hand

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:46.479
I promise that, that, that, that…

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.881
He's not running away.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.251
He's facing things head-on
and working through the issues.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:57.523
I could tell that he really does have
feelings for me and that he was sincere.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:00.926
Well, I'm

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.897
feeling slowly drawn to him.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:07.933
With love…

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.502
I feel better.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.437
You feel better?

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:16.509
And rise a little higher…

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.277
I thought he was so cute.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.379
I just wanted to touch him.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.449
Wait, what's this feeling?

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:26.452
People don't normally meet like this.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:31.323
Most of the time, people will meet
through a dating site or on a dating app

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:34.360
and get close in a short period of time.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.499
But, for me, I've never experienced
my affection slowly building over time.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.235
It's frightening because it's new to me.

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:46.972
Closer again

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:52.645
{\an8}- Amazing. That's so interesting.
- That was an unexpected development.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.981
So, in fact, things are going really well
between William and Izaya.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.950
I feel a little bad about what I said.

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:01.120
- I assumed William was like me, but…
- That's right, sensei.

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:02.988
It turns out
he's a much better person than me.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.990
- Absolutely.
- I apologize, William.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.126
You said it was an excuse
to say no to Jobu.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.861
I did, and I'm so embarrassed.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:09.929
Please stop.

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.864
He turned out to be
on a much higher level.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.568
William was just afraid
because this feeling was new to him.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.203
It's also because we live in an era

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.638
where it's easy
to make instant connections,

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:23.008
and being popular makes it difficult
to slowly build relationships,

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.344
so he hasn't experienced that until now.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.313
Maybe Izaya's direct approach,

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.849
the conversation he had
in the gym, worked.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.184
He took charge from the start,
and it actually worked.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.352
For the longest time,

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.589
I had no idea what William was
really thinking or feeling,

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.624
but now we know he's attracted to Izaya.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:41.026
- We can assume things are going well.
- Things are going well.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.195
{\an8}Are they waterproof?

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.865
{\an8}No, they're not. Today might be
the worst day for my shoes.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.435
- You okay?
- Ah!

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.337
- Be careful.
- Oh, that's cute.

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:54.039
- That was really nice of him.
- That startled me.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:56.142
Let's walk on this side
where there's no snow.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.246
- Here?
- Here it is. The Ainu Kotan.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.715
Really? This is kind of… nice.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.150
The atmosphere is nice.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.385
- It has its own style.
- For sure.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.188
Let's visit.

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.557
- Let's buy something.
- Mm.

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:15.528
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like this before in my life.

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.563
- Carvings?
- Yeah, like the wooden bear carving.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.998
It reminds me of someone.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.633
- Of who?
- Of you.

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.902
No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like me.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.470
There are so many of you.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.674
Have you ever worn
something matching with someone else?

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.777
- Let me think about it.
- It's okay.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.879
I've never worn anything matching.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.514
- You've never?
- Never.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:38.184
Should we get something that matches?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.852
- Should we?
- Maybe?

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:48.160
- Let's keep looking.
- Yeah. Or we could get matching mugs.

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.562
- They're nice.
- They are.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.064
Wooden mugs aren't something
you see every day.

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:54.433
Are these the only mugs they have?
Are there others?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.101
Do you see anything else you like?

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.871
Other than the mugs,
what do you think would be nice?

00:13:58.938 --> 00:13:59.972
What do you think?

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:01.974
Let's see.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:06.278
Why don't we both…
You choose something that looks like me,

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.747
and I'll choose
something that looks like you.

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:11.951
- Okay.
- And then we can open them when we eat.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.219
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.087
- Let's do that.
- How fun.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.089
- Nice idea.
- Yeah.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.365
Which one should I get?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.740
- This is what a date should be like.
- Yeah.

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:36.842
The other date was so tense and serious.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:39.178
It's nice to be able to create
an activity out of nothing.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.112
That's true.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:43.015
If they come back with matching items,
everyone else will be like…

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.317
- It's a form of marking.
- "A form of marking"!

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.789
That chat about romance earlier was fun.

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:53.559
Like being dependent. Really?

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:56.829
{\an8}- Being dependent isn't good.
- So you understand it's not good?

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.197
{\an8}Yeah, I know it's not good.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.266
- Okay.
- Like, becoming obsessed with someone?

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:03.269
Yeah,
like "dropping out of college" obsessed.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.970
That's crazy!

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.106
So if your boyfriend said,

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:10.009
"Hey, I wanna hang out with you today,
so ditch class,"

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.110
you would ditch class?

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:13.078
- I'd skip class.
- That's a bad boyfriend.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:15.614
- That's not good.
- Yeah, but I like bad boys.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.485
Yeah, I get what you mean.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.620
- Bad boys are nice.
- Bad boys are nice.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:24.790
- Bad boys are attractive. I get it.
- They're nice. I get it.

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:28.460
That indifference they have…
is incredibly attractive.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:32.331
- Yeah, I get it.
- I get it.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:35.701
I don't want them to use exclamation marks
in their texts.

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:37.836
Man, that's specific.

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:40.205
So you want them
to be indifferent toward you?

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.573
Not to show any interest at all?

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.976
"Okay," "yeah,"
that's enough for me. Or "LOL."

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:47.446
- That's funny.
- You're a masochist? What's your deal?

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.816
- So you want them to be indifferent.
- And I wanna stress over that.

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.419
Wait, what do you mean?
I don't think I get it.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.820
Sorry, I don't get it.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.089
I don't think I get
the "wanting to stress" part.

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:58.958
- Hilarious.
- Super hilarious.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.327
I wanna tell my friends
that he's indifferent…

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.996
- Ah.
- But he does this and this for me.

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.200
And then your friends would be like,
"You should leave him."

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.803
"Ryu, you really shouldn't be dating
someone like that, you know."

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.671
But I never break up with him.

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:15.641
- You don't break up with him.
- You tell them, "But I still like him."

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:20.646
- Is that okay? I'm so worried about you.
- Well, that's what I wanna stress over.

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:23.115
Well, okay, then,

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:26.285
you can have dreams like that.
It's fine. I get it.

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.325
{\an8}TELECOM SALES WORKER

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.661
{\an8}Dating again is really hard when

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.464
{\an8}you haven't done it for so long.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.799
{\an8}All I've known is familial love

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.401
{\an8}for the past 15 years.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:46.038
I devoted myself completely to it,

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.374
so, in a lot of ways, I'm kind of stuck.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:53.178
I very clearly remember the day
we officially decided to be together.

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.715
I met my ex when I was 24 years old.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.651
He kept telling me
that he wanted to be with me,

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:02.654
and I kept telling him
to wait a little bit longer,

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.289
that I wasn't ready yet.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.693
Then, finally,
one day, after about three months,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.929
I said to myself,
"Okay, I'm gonna be with this guy."

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:14.066
I decided I would tell him
the next time we met.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:18.737
Coincidentally, the day I went to see him
turned out to be

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:24.743
the very same day… he decided
that he wouldn't wait for me any longer.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.578
Our decisions overlapped.

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:30.716
But I had truly decided to tell him
that day that I wanted to be with him,

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.919
that I wanted… to officially be with him.

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:37.689
So, when he told me that,
I ended up crying a lot.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.693
But then he said, "Oh, I see.
I'm sorry. Let's be together, then."

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.595
That's how we officially got together.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:46.965
That's so good.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.234
Talking about it
made me wanna cry a little.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.571
He almost started to cry
when he talked about it. That's so pure.

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:57.176
Talking about it to someone like you…
brings back memories.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.878
Yeah. That's how
our life together started.

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:04.983
- What a really great start.
- It made me remember how it was.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:09.088
Yeah, come to think of it,
that's how it all started.

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:10.689
It just hit me again.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:13.959
I remember it well.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.962
I remember where we were
when we talked about it.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.665
I also remember myself crying.

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:23.001
I cried so much that day.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.741
Remembering everything
that happened that day

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:33.312
is very… emotional for me.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:39.184
- Fifteen years is a long time.
- It is a long time.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.453
- I think I'm super happy.
- Mm.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.989
- Right now is the happiest moment.
- Mm.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:48.227
We wrote each other's name
to go on this date, right?

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.529
- Mm.
- Why did you…

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.933
Tell me what was on your mind.

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.636
Honestly, at first,

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.205
I have to say, I was interested in Izaya.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.707
- I knew that.
- You did?

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.375
Mm.

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:05.644
I was watching you the whole time,
so I knew.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.247
- I saw you were interested in him.
- I was interested.

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.716
And? I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:11.850
So I was interested in him,

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:14.620
but then I suddenly lost interest
a little while ago.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.521
Why is that?

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:18.257
When I saw
how close Izaya and William were,

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.093
I realized that I didn't have
the same romantic vibe

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.061
that William seems to have naturally.

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:23.996
Mm.

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.797
I also realized I wasn't his first choice.

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:26.999
- I see.
- So, yeah.

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.101
And then, when they announced
the one-on-one dates…

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.068
Mm.

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:32.671
…you seemed to pop into my head.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.140
- Is that what happened?
- Mm.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.442
Also, because you chose me

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.912
on your first day
running the coffee truck,

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.948
I thought, "I hope he writes my name down
for the date."

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.684
Well, for me, you were my only choice.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.785
Really?

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.988
That's why I wanted to read the tablet.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.525
I wanted to be
the first to see the results.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.527
I'm glad I was able to…

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:56.528
Um…

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:59.298
…go out

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.134
with you like this…

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:05.404
because, honestly,
I didn't think I'd be able to.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.139
You know what I mean?

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.575
I never thought you'd be here.
That was a surprise.

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:12.311
And if I had missed this opportunity,

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.313
I'd never be able
to get to know you better.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.081
That's why

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:19.651
I chose you for the coffee truck

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:22.120
and wrote your name down for the date.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.124
And that's all.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.494
Awkward.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:32.297
At first, I have to say, I was also…

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.167
My impression of you now
is completely different

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.468
from when we first met.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.837
- Is that a good thing?
- It's getting better.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:39.871
Oh, really?

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:41.673
I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.209
Yeah.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.079
I'm too embarrassed
to look you in the eyes.

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.881
- That's cute.
- That's cute.

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:51.583
I think his approach is the best.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.985
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:55.120
Oh, should we open them?

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.258
This is kind of embarrassing.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.660
- Here.
- Here.

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:04.630
- It's big.
- It's kind of big.

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.398
- This one's big too.
- This one's also big.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.969
Wait. This is super cute.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.305
- I thought he looked like you.
- Oh, really? A fox?

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.107
So I'm a fox, then.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.847
Hey, isn't it cute? It's cute, right?

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.349
I wanted the bigger one,
but I didn't have the money.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:25.317
Hang on.

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.319
- Wait
- Wait for what?

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.988
- Never mind.
- What is it? Do you have a story to share?

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.256
No, it's nothing.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:35.160
- It's the same!
- Oh, I thought so.

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.796
I guess people just wanna give him
things like that.

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:39.931
I really wanted this.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.733
- It's cute, right?
- It's cute.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.102
It's really cute.

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:46.204
- It's cute, right?
- It's cute.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.040
What's up? What's with your reaction?

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:50.242
- No, it's really cute. Yeah.
- It's cute, right?

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.544
I won't let you say anything else
than it's cute.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.647
- There's just one thing.
- Tell me.

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:58.950
I have a smaller version of this one.

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:00.352
Oh, you do?

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:03.422
Well, it's a…
it's a little different from this one,

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:04.589
but Hiroya gave it to me.

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:05.657
No way.

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:09.027
- No way he could've guessed.
- That's why I laughed.

00:22:09.094 --> 00:22:10.028
But it's really cute.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.264
Everyone knows that I love these,
don't they?

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:13.899
- You like it?
- I love it.

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:16.034
- That's good. I'm glad.
- It's my favorite.

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.536
Good. I really struggled over it.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.739
I thought I might as well get
the biggest one they have.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.507
- A bigger one?
- One with more presence.

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.876
This fox is cute. I'll put it on later.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.112
Maybe I can attach it to my phone.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:30.248
Don't you think it would get in the way
if you were to do that?

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:32.551
It's fine. Everyone can see it.

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:37.089
I can say, "Huwei got it for me. Look!"

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:38.857
Should I not show it off?

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.326
It's fine. You can show it off.

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.396
This chicken curry is gonna be delicious!

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:45.897
I'm sure.

00:22:45.964 --> 00:22:48.266
- It's ready.
- I'm getting ready to smile.

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.370
Thanks to everyone, I think I've been able
to get myself under control.

00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:52.270
Really?

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.574
- I smell something.
- It's coming from here?

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.410
If Huwei were here,
he'd want to add some apples

00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:00.045
or some cola as a secret ingredient.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:01.713
- He'd add cola.
- He would for sure.

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.950
- Gross.
- Let's add some cola to the dish.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.252
He'd say it would give richness
to the flavor.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:09.121
He always adds stuff to his cooking.

00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:13.158
I don't think it will get any less watery.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.727
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.362
- Yeah.
- Was this what we smelled outside?

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.597
Oh, maybe it is.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.799
What is that?

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.968
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:25.203
- So we're back.
- Oh no! Hide it!

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.605
Welcome back.

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:28.173
He's not hiding it at all.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.674
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:30.976
Bomi is shielding him.

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.477
- Something smells good.
- It does.

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:35.514
- We're making curry.
- Curry today. Butter chicken curry.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.282
- That looks delicious.
- Wow, that looks good.

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:39.851
Hiroya hasn't noticed yet, right?

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.253
I don't think he has yet.

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.522
I think a store detective
might have noticed.

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.123
Yeah. "Stop right there, sir!"

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.093
- Let it simmer for ten minutes.
- It smells really good.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.398
Hey, you have something on you.

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.500
- It's a fox.
- Did you buy that?

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:58.103
- He got it for me.
- Did you see one? Did you see a fox?

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.238
- No, I didn't. It's from the store.
- You didn't?

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.444
Bomi seemed to be in very high spirits.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.647
He had a new fox keychain on his phone.

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:11.550
I had mixed feelings about that. Yeah.

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.122
We're back. That was really a fun day.

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.592
- We made good memories.
- Yeah.

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.397
- They're back.
- Hi.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.132
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.535
- Dinner's ready.
- Dinner's ready?

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.471
I thought I smelled something good.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.073
- I'll start serving.
- Mm.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.908
- Did you have fun?
- How was it?

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.143
- Yeah.
- We had fun, right?

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.011
We did. What about you two?

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:42.180
- So did we, right?
- What? Yeah, we did.

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:44.382
- Hey, hey.
- Tell us all about it later.

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.351
It felt like I was forcing him
to say that.

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.620
What's on your phone?

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.023
- It was a gift.
- A fox keychain.

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.560
I attached it to my phone
so I could show it off.

00:24:58.463 --> 00:24:59.397
It's cute.

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.465
Ruff-ruff.

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:10.809
Oh, this is so complicated!

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.310
That's understandable though.

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:15.547
{\an8}I think our impression of Bomi
has started to change a lot, right?

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:16.615
{\an8}It has.

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.184
{\an8}It feels like
he's really becoming a wonderful person

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:21.119
{\an8}who can clearly express his thoughts now.

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:24.022
{\an8}The way he said, "I'm so embarrassed,
I can't look you in the eyes,"

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:26.658
{\an8}that was an old-fashioned move,
but it was a nice touch.

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.893
It was sweet how he did it.

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.828
I thought that was
the right move for him to do.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.696
- "I can't look."
- Yeah, the fanning,

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:34.900
That was cute. This always shows
how much it affects you.

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:36.935
I think it really suits his character.

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:40.805
What is it about Huwei that makes people
want to give him a toy bird?

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:44.242
{\an8}Yeah, especially this one,
because it's a long-tailed tit,

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:47.279
{\an8}and one thing about the long-tailed tit
is that when they form a pair,

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:49.881
{\an8}they leave the flock together,
and they stay really close

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.349
{\an8}and become a couple.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.985
{\an8}- That's lovely!
- Yeah. That's their story.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:57.022
{\an8}But, you know, Hiroya had given him
a red-crowned crane.

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:59.591
{\an8}- A red-crowned…
- That's why there was red there.

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:01.059
{\an8}So it's a red-crowned crane.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:04.863
{\an8}So both Hiroya and Bomi gave Huwei
a bird plushy

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.999
knowing very well that plushies
are something he likes a lot.

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.668
But Hiroya's having mixed feelings.

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.637
- He asked Bomi if he had seen a fox.
- Yeah, his question was weird.

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:14.973
- It was really weird.
- He was saying something weird.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.344
But after what he said, don't you think
Kazuyuki is a pure-hearted person?

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:23.648
Would you get teary-eyed
by talking about your past relationship?

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.750
Would you remember how you first met,

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:28.286
get all sentimental,
and say, "I'm gonna cry"?

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:31.957
- I don't think I would cry.
- You wouldn't, right? He's a pure soul.

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.825
- He's a lovely person.
- He's lovely.

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:36.628
It would be great to be in a relationship
with someone like him.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.830
- I'm sure it's the case.
- He's really great.

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.366
- Maybe he hasn't moved on yet.
- Yeah, maybe so.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.436
When you break up with someone
you've been with for 15 years,

00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:45.971
you've gone through everything, right?

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.906
- You might be right.
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.212
- I'll read it today.
- Go ahead.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.680
"Good morning."

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.182
Good morning.

00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:00.719
Huh? Now, I'm scared.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.587
"Here's the person on duty
for today's shift."

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:03.722
That startled me.

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.323
{\an8}"For today's shift…

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.995
{\an8}Ryuki will be on duty today."

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.329
{\an8}Oh.

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.864
{\an8}- My first time.
- Your turn.

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:15.400
{\an8}"Ryuki, please choose the person
you want to work with."

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:16.301
{\an8}Okay.

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:19.304
{\an8}"Once you've decided,
please turn over that person's nameplate."

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.684
- Izaya?
- Izaya!

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:35.220
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:42.360
- See you later.
- See you later. Good luck.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:45.797
He's coming in between those two.

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.866
Is he going to shake things up
between them?

00:27:47.932 --> 00:27:49.434
- This is great!
- Incredible.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.336
This is what a dating show is all about!

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:54.039
{\an8}This might stimulate William a little.

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:58.943
I can't believe how few people
there are here. It's a little sad.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.279
- There's no one here.
- Yeah.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.915
We'll have to bring them in.

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:11.256
Excuse me, we're selling coffee here.
Please come if you'd like some.

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:13.425
We're selling coffee. Would you like some?

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.261
That's the first time
I've heard that voice.

00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:18.229
- I spoke too loudly.
- It was good.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.032
Did someone come? Hello and welcome.

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:22.033
Hello.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.735
How many hot chocolates would you like?

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:25.770
- Three hot chocolates.
- Three.

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.806
It'll take a little time. Is that okay?

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.574
- That's okay.
- Thank you so much.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:30.875
You've got this.

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.378
Yeah, that's it.

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:36.648
Um, here you go.
Here are your three hot chocolate milks.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.917
- I'm so cold.
- These'll warm us up.

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.820
- Here's your change. Fifty yen.
- Okay, let's go.

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:45.724
7,450 yen.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.392
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah, you're right.

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.228
- Good work.
- Good work.

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.464
- This was great.
- Yeah, it was.

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:56.334
{\an8}7,450 YEN

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.637
{\an8}I didn't think
I'd be chosen by someone today,

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:00.705
{\an8}so I was really surprised.

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:01.740
You were surprised?

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.776
When I first got here

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:06.945
and met everyone,

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:11.883
the one person
who stood out to me the most was

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:14.552
you, Izaya.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.888
From that moment on,

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:21.626
I knew… that you would be my first choice.

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:25.196
- Thank you. I make a good impression?
- You made a good impression.

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:29.267
But it… took a lot of courage
to choose you.

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:32.270
- I can imagine. I totally understand.
- I was really nervous today.

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:33.171
Mm.

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:35.106
I was really nervous.

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:40.044
I mean, I'm probably the first person
you've talked to one-on-one, right?

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:43.648
So you haven't talked to many of them
one-on-one yet,

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:45.650
- I have to talk to them. Mm.
- Am I right?

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:48.086
It would be great for you
to make that happen

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.788
so you can get to know everyone better.

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.389
- Of course.
- Yeah.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.692
There are things you can only understand
when you're one-on-one,

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:58.062
like sides of a person
you wouldn't normally see.

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:02.000
I hope you'll get to see
the hidden sides of our roommates.

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:04.068
Mm. I'd like that.

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.208
Are we still going at 4:00 to the sauna?

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:11.176
Uh, yes.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.145
You can't change your mind
right before we go, okay?

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:15.079
Yeah, okay.

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.022
Oh man.

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:27.692
Being here makes me… feel bad
for the truck team.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.494
- I totally get that.
- Right?

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:32.664
Did you have fun yesterday?

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.666
Yeah, I had fun.

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.436
I wish I could have gone.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.471
With everyone?

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:41.806
Just with you.

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.379
If the next shift…

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:51.516
You haven't been shift leader yet,
so when it's your turn,

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.551
will you choose Izaya?

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.421
Yeah.

00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:00.191
- Hot place to talk about that.
- Yeah.

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:02.260
In case they start crying,
the sweat will hide it.

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:03.528
Oh, that's why.

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:06.064
When we talked last time,

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:10.101
it felt like you weren't telling me no,

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:15.406
but you weren't… saying yes… either.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.642
So I'm confused about what to do.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:20.912
I know. I expressed myself that way
after everything that happened,

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.814
but that's how I really felt at the time.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.115
Mm-hmm.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:26.618
…to work through my feelings,

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:29.254
and I'm still very unsure.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.154
You don't know.

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:34.225
But I know I can't face both of you
at the same time.

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.193
Mm.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.797
So if we had
the same conversation again now,

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.132
you'd answer no?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.137
It would be a lot easier if you could
just be straight with me, okay?

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:47.872
Of course.

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:49.841
It's a no.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:51.042
Thank you.

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:55.213
I think… it makes things easier for me.

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:06.791
Can we end with a hug?

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:09.861
Of course.

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:12.063
Thank you.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:21.773
This is sad.

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.309
You're right. Sometimes things have to end
this way, don't they?

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.843
- This does last two months.
- Yeah.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.279
- It's over for now.
- Yeah, it's over.

00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:30.181
- Okay.
- We're good.

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:31.249
Let's go.

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.390
We're back.

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:41.759
- Welcome back.
- Hi, guys, welcome back.

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.227
What are you making?

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:44.896
Pot stickers.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:47.031
- It's a pot sticker party today?
- That's right.

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.666
There's gonna be a lot to eat.

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:51.102
Yeah. We were thinking
of making one with just wasabi

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.004
or something really spicy in it.

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:53.972
Let's do it.

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.641
So the person who gets it
asks a question and everyone answers?

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.010
So you get rewarded instead of penalized.

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:00.311
It's not sticking.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.247
- I don't want this one.
- Which one is that?

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.149
- How much did you put in?
- I put in a whole one.

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.784
A whole one? Isn't that a lot?

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.187
- It looks good.
- Looks delicious.

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:10.388
Don't they look good?

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.958
Enjoy your meal.

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:20.765
The pot stickers are good.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:25.603
No one's gotten the spicy one yet?

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.071
No one yet.

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:31.576
Hold on.

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.045
- Huh?
- The chili pepper is spicy.

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:35.446
Did you get the spicy one?

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:36.547
Oh no.

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.017
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.319
Who put the chili pepper in?

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.453
I did.

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:45.289
- It's Hiroya's fault.
- That's not okay.

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:48.026
- See, I told you not to do it.
- No, you didn't.

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.728
- You were enjoying it.
- Yeah.

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.297
Do you wanna ask your question?

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.370
I wanna know if everyone… is in love now.

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.940
- Hmm.
- Whoa.

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.576
- I like it.
- Me too.

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:07.078
It's just a yes or no..

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.413
And no passing.

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.415
No passing?

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.517
We all have to answer yes or no?

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.287
Who should start?

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:18.623
Let's go around quickly, then. Yes or no.

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.858
Let's go this way. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.427
- No time to think.
- Okay.

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.728
One, two, three. Yes.

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.696
Yes. I jumped the gun.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.799
Forget it. You didn't hear anything.

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.901
- Hey, we're going this way.
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:34.138
- Oh wow. You lost your turn.
- Let's go the other way.

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.606
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.444
Uh, yes.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.445
No.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:42.313
Yes.

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:44.615
Um, no.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:47.251
It's over.

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:48.352
Wait a minute.

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:50.855
Momentum is important. You can't hesitate.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.490
You have to go with the flow.

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.394
It's a yes.

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:59.997
Thank goodness. If he said no,
it would've been a different story.

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:02.767
- It was a good question.
- Good question.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.605
- Let's do our best.
- Let's do our best?

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.708
People who said no, let's do our best.

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.110
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.344
I'll do my best.

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:24.088
- Oh, Jobu!
- Jobu did his best.

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:25.623
He did his best, yeah.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.960
- Ryuki asked a great question.
- It really was a great question to ask.

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.361
Yeah, it was.

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.233
Oh, here it is.

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:40.171
{\an8}"For today's work shift,
William will be on duty."

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.941
{\an8}- That's a full circle.
- Has everyone gotten their turn?

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:45.109
{\an8}Yeah, they did.

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:09.934
- Let's work together.
- Let's do it.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:12.136
I know you worked yesterday,
but let's do this.

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:13.638
- That's true.
- It's okay.

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:20.011
- Everyone's had a turn now.
- That's right.

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:24.148
That means we can do something
to celebrate, right? As a reward.

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:29.053
Any ideas… for what we could do
all together, as a group,

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.323
after we've each run the coffee truck?

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.491
A trip.

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:36.327
- I'd like to go on a trip.
- How about an overnight trip?

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.429
- I like that idea.
- An overnight trip?

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:40.364
- Niseko!
- Niseko, yes!

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:43.100
Niseko sounds great.
It has to be Niseko.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:46.003
Niseko, Niseko.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.171
Snowboarding.

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:49.006
- The hot spring.
- I want that too.

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:51.742
I wanna have fun with everyone.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:54.111
I bet he's thinking,
"Maybe I won't go after all."

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.846
Yeah. It's really painful.

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:01.085
Here.

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.255
Today is bad.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:05.756
- Huh? Today is bad?
- Today is bad.

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.124
Because there's nobody?

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:09.460
Because there's almost nobody,
and it's cold.

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:10.728
It sure is cold.

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:13.497
{\an8}We're open.

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:17.835
Hello and welcome.

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:21.505
One hot caffe latte
and one drip coffee, medium, please.

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:24.242
- Right away. Thank you very much.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.515
- What are you doing there?
- This is just… Wait, this is…

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.150
Do it over here.

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.755
I couldn't help but think it was cute.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:42.393
Seeing him trying to work as close to me
as possible, even though it was cramped,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.929
just made me think,
"There's more space over there."

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.731
But he was so close to me,

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:49.467
and I realized
I liked how natural he was with me.

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:52.336
- Where are the coffee beans?
- I just thought that was really cute.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.708
- Are you on a trip?
- We are.

00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:00.111
- Oh, that's nice.
- We went to Lake Mashu.

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:02.346
Lake Mashu? That's nice.
I've never been there.

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:06.784
- Wow, that's so beautiful.
- The weather was perfect too.

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:09.887
- Wow, that's amazing.
- All the lakes we went to were frozen.

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:14.225
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:16.761
- Enjoy your trip. Thank you.
- Enjoy your trip. Thank you.

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:20.064
Lake Mashu, I've never heard of it.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:23.134
It must be nice
to go on a trip as a couple.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.037
- I'd like to go on trips. Yeah.
- I'd like to do that.

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:30.608
5,700 YEN

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.544
The weather's crazy.
It suddenly got so bad out.

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:34.879
- It's a blizzard.
- Yeah.

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:35.913
Yeah.

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:39.850
- This was interesting in its own way.
- This'll make a great memory for sure.

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.852
No doubt about that.

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:45.356
You know, little by little, day by day,

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:48.259
we get more time alone together.

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:51.662
And some things we just can't talk about
at other times, right?

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:56.667
So by using these moments
to tell each other what we truly value,

00:38:57.168 --> 00:39:00.738
I feel like our relationship
is able to move forward,

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.473
step by step, one at a time.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.641
I think so too.

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:09.980
It's also getting harder for me
to hide my true feelings these days.

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:13.651
Of course, I wanna be
mindful of others. However…

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:15.486
Mm.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.789
…I'd like to stop
holding myself back as much.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.759
- You're always natural, Izaya.
- Thanks.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.801
And I think
I've started to see things differently.

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:31.902
Mm.

00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:33.537
I'm glad to hear that.

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:36.874
I see you in a completely different light
than before,

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:42.713
and I wonder just how much
my feelings will continue to grow.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.218
I know they're in the right direction,
and that actually scares me a little.

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:50.287
At first,
I wondered which way it would go, but now…

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.590
It's going in the right direction.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:20.551
I trace your name
In this cold, freezing air

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:24.955
You're still a shadow
I know you were there…

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:28.793
Since we finished our work shift,
we can go out and have fun.

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:31.228
To Niseko, right?
I'm looking forward to it.

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:33.364
Let's make some more memories.

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:40.337
I hear your voice
In the wind's quiet song

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:45.209
Fading like echoes whenever so long

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.845
I'll be reaching for

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.481
I'll be reaching for you

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:51.816
Now hold my hand

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:53.951
I promise that

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:58.522
With love

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:03.294
I can change the sky above

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.299
And rise a little higher

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:14.538
Until the stars feel closer

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:18.542
With love

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:23.514
I can change the sky above

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:28.319
And rise a little higher

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:34.225
Until the stars feel closer

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.093
Again

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:43.601
Do you think Jobu is okay?

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:46.370
{\an8}- He won't leave, will he?
- What? I don't want that.

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:49.373
{\an8}Well, it would be understandable
if he did leave, don't you think?

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.442
{\an8}He wouldn't wanna go to Niseko
in this situation.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.944
{\an8}That's the last place
he'd wanna go right now.

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.680
{\an8}He was just told no, straight to his face,

00:41:56.747 --> 00:42:00.784
{\an8}even though he asked William to be
brutally honest with him for his own good.

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.687
{\an8}But, still,
hearing the truth always hurts.

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.689
{\an8}And then they had a naked hug.

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:08.092
{\an8}- A sweaty, naked hug.
- Yeah, that was also…

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:10.294
{\an8}Yeah, the hug he wanted so badly
became the last hug.

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:13.430
{\an8}- Oh, you're right!
- That makes it even worse!

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:16.700
{\an8}- It's just too sad.
- Oh no!

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:18.168
{\an8}It was sweaty, but it was good.

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:21.906
Yeah, I mean, I guess it would have
been weird if they got out of the sauna,

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.407
took a shower, got dressed,

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.676
and then hugged each other
to say thank you.

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:27.411
That was the only moment they could do it.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.746
The only moment.
