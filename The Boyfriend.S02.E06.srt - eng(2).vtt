00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.720
{\an8}TELECOM SALES WORKER

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:27.394
{\an8}MARKETER AT MANUFACTURING COMPANY

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:40.673
- He's drawing on him.
- Their relationship is soothing.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.710
- These two are great together.
- I think so too.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.590
{\an8}- Did I doze off?
- Good morning.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.026
When everyone's so quiet,
it makes me sleepy.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.796
It's hard to draw properly.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.532
- It's cute he drew hearts on him.
- It's cute.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.133
Did he also write "meat"?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.935
- I'm tired.
- Good job.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.938
You know you have hearts on your face?

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.940
- For real?
- Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:14.841
- What?
- Huh?

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.209
{\an8}I'm sorry.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.011
{\an8}- That says "meat"!
- Oh, you're right.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.046
{\an8}That's like in the Kinnikuman manga!

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.515
{\an8}I didn't feel anything.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.418
I did a pretty good job.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.320
Mm. You did.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.756
Even today,
they still reference that old manga?

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.963
OFF TO NISEKO WE GO!
LET'S HAVE FUN TO THE MAX!

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.032
Come on, let's go!

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.201
It feels like a school trip.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.369
- It really does.
- The bus is huge!

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.972
- Look, Jobu's going too.
- What a trouper!

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.041
He's so good at switching gears.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.042
Respect, Jobu.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.710
{\an8}IT COMPANY SALES WORKER

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.045
{\an8}Where did you wanna sit?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.048
- It's taken.
- Sorry, did you want the window seat?

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.916
- I wanted the window seat.
- Naturally.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.219
- It's taken.
- I'm already thirsty.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.124
{\an8}ART DIRECTOR

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.426
{\an8}Hiroya's sitting next to Bomi.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.427
{\an8}UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.028
{\an8}GRADUATE STUDENT

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:09.996
{\an8}Are you okay here?

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.064
{\an8}IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.999
- What?
- Are you okay?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.335
Hiroya, you wanna switch places?

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.171
- It's fine. We can take turns.
- Is that okay with you?

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:21.875
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.976
Yay!

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.545
- We're off!
- Yay!

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.116
What a luxurious experience.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.317
It really is.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.720
But it does feel like a school trip.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.058
- We should listen to some music.
- To music?

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.360
- Together.
- Okay.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.096
I want you to listen to my playlist.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.499
I want you to listen to mine.
Let's listen to each together.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.567
Let's do that.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.137
I have to say, I'm a bit nervous
about using my phone in front of you.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.474
- Do you have weird stuff on it?
- No! I don't.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.143
You kind of just admitted to having
weird stuff on it.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.245
I mean,
I'm scared a notification might pop up,

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.080
like the other day.
This side or this side?

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.649
You said you wouldn't get any.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.785
I don't know about that.
I can't control what people send me.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.887
You did say you wouldn't get them anymore.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.256
- No. I can't prevent it.
- You definitely…

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.158
You told me you wouldn't get them anymore.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.127
Listen to the music.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.130
- This could get tricky.
- It's a trauma for him.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.998
- William's scared.
- Amazing.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.066
It's so beautiful.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.570
My mom's been sending me worried texts.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.905
- Oh, really?
- She's telling me to come home.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:29.576
It's because my mood was up and down,
like a rollercoaster.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.378
I'll have a hard time one day,
but today, I'm having fun.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:36.149
I go home every two or three months,
but she fights with me every time I leave

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.151
at the Osaka bullet train station.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.487
Just a 60-year-old woman screaming
on the platform of the station each time.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:45.225
I do wanna go home for a while,
at least for my mom.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.459
Mm.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.830
- It's plum.
- Thank you very much.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.466
Wait a second, there are other flavors.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.401
It's good.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.471
I like this.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.240
- My mood is sinking.
- What?

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.142
Come here.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.545
Absolutely not.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:07.947
I feel sick.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.684
- My shoulder's free.
- I'm gonna sulk and sleep. Sulk and sleep.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.754
- Kazuyuki is such a nice guy.
- He's adorable. He's so sweet.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:15.955
Such a good friend.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.701
"Think easy," she said

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.638
"Forever young and so wild"

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.807
"Or pull a gun and then fire it"

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:38.344
- "Easy," she said
- She said

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:44.284
"You're never young if you don't run
So get over"

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.353
- We still got walls on both sides
- Sides

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.788
Maybe

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.824
- I wanna know how to climb
- Climb

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.526
- We're blind, blind
- Blind

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.596
- How'd we get air all this time?
- This time

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.197
- These things
- These things

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:00.433
I never thought when you were mine

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.002
We used to break it together

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.004
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:09.542
We used to dive
In our highest feelings

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:12.278
Are we growing older together?

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.147
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:18.885
I don't wanna miss anything
When I'm dreaming about

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.754
When we were dazed and confused

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.928
Oh, you can see Mount Yotei now.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.830
- Where?
- Mount Yotei.

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.598
- Is it famous?
- It's famous.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.935
- Is that the mountain in Niseko?
- It's the one right next to it.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.504
- We're here.
- Whoa.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.914
It's really beautiful.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.817
Are we here? I think we're here.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:51.818
We're here.

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.686
- Exciting.
- It is.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:54.921
We're finally here!

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.556
- Let's go in.
- This is great.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.557
Wow.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.559
- Amazing.
- It's so beautiful.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.894
- Wow, amazing.
- This is so fancy.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.796
Wow! Open the door.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.466
- Whoa!
- Wow!

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.934
Wow, amazing!

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.770
This is really nice.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.210
Bomi can enjoy the hot spring now.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.778
Yeah, Bomi can enjoy it now.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:30.957
I'm starving.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.425
- I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry too.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.460
Don't you feel like having
Hokkaido cuisine?

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.196
Yeah.
Maybe it's because we're wearing yukatas.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.098
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.333
- Cheers!
- I can't reach.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.234
Here, cheers!

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.136
- Cheers!
- Cheers, everyone.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.170
Yay.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:47.473
- Who's the cutest one here?
- Me.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.176
Do we raise our hands?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.813
No, the cutest one here is Ryuki.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.781
It's Ryuki.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:55.681
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.717
- Huwei is cute.
- Yeah, he is cute.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:58.985
You think I'm cute?

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.421
When he walked in,
I thought he was the distant type,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.856
but when he started talking,
I got a different impression.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.359
The same could be said about you, William.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.994
True. You're more like that.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.463
You're more like that than me,
so you can't say that.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.631
He's the cute type.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.733
- We're the same.
- We're the same.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.067
I agree. We're the same.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.302
You two are the same.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.871
- To good memories.
- To good memories.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.873
I already miss those days.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.812
How do you wanna spend…
the rest of your time here?

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.350
I wanna be sure
to do something I won't regret.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.753
I wanna cherish each moment I have here.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.857
I usually think about the consequences.
Maybe I don't need to think about that.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.892
Just try not to worry about anything?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.161
But if I don't worry,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.032
then I'll worry
that I might end up being out of control.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:49.235
- But I think that's okay too.
- You should show your true self more.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.803
- You should too.
- Kazuyuki.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.738
You should do that more than anyone.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.007
- You're not showing it.
- This is me.

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:58.277
- The Osaka Kazu must be different, then.
- Is he right?

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.079
The Osaka Kazu?

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.582
We should finish talking.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.617
We were in the middle of something.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.286
- Earlier, we were talking…
- …about what to do afterwards.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:08.921
- About what we want to do?
- Yeah, I mean…

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.891
I'm sorry. I've got a question for Ryuki.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.527
- What is it?
- Tell us, have you come out yet?

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.965
I've gone out of my way to come out
to friends I wanna get close to,

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.667
if I think it's okay to tell someone.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:22.635
Oh.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:26.939
When I tell them,
I feel like they finally know the real me.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.976
But… I haven't told my parents.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.446
So if someone has come out
to their parents,

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.181
I would really like to know

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.552
just when and how
they decided to announce it to them.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:43.556
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've never come out to them directly,

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.525
but I've introduced my boyfriends to them,

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.895
and I've always talked with my mom
about how handsome guys were.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.030
- Hmm.
- I was never concerned by that.

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.865
They could tell without asking me,

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.033
and that was it.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:57.336
- My whole family's like that.
- That's great.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:01.007
For those who haven't told…
their parents yet,

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.608
how do you think they'd react?

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.077
I haven't come out
and told them straight-up

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.813
because I don't really like
using the word "gay,"

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.583
but my mom is always telling me

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.586
that she's expecting
to have five grandchildren.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.489
Every time she says that,
I tell her to stop it.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.992
I tell her that I'm not into women,
and that's how I kind of let her know.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.460
- You told her that?
- I did.

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:25.831
But it's possible she might not have…
taken what I said seriously.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:29.569
If I told her properly,
she might be able to accept it.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.072
But then again, she might not accept it.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:38.344
Same for me.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.713
I'm really torn.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:44.383
All my friends, for example,

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:47.386
and my cousins and my aunt,

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:50.056
I told them fairly easily.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:55.194
But coming out to my parents
is an impossible task.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.397
And I know it's because

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.734
being attracted to the same sex…

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:07.406
- It's unthinkable?
- They have… a negative opinion about it.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:10.309
Mm. Do they know any gays?

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.714
I don't know if they do,
but… no matter how many…

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.984
people I can tell around me,

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.720
and who will support me,

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.255
if my parents ultimately reject me…

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.359
it'll just be sad.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.863
So I guess that's the biggest obstacle.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.268
{\an8}That's so hard.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:39.872
{\an8}So we finally got to hear
how Ryuki feels about his family life.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:42.942
Sometimes, the casual remarks
made in daily life,

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.411
like the things people say
while watching TV,

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:48.381
tend to really stick with those
who are directly concerned by them.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.682
There are actually many times

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:52.351
when people think
they can't come out to their people

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.553
because they heard something like that.

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.823
I really hope this can serve
as an opportunity

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.293
to encourage everyone who needs it
to come out to their friends and family.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.497
By participating in this show,
they're determined to find a solution.

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:05.798
We're rooting for them.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.000
{\an8}It was good to see
that Jobu went on the trip.

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.735
{\an8}I was almost sure he wouldn't go.

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.270
{\an8}Everyone who's in this show

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.507
{\an8}is here with the hope of finding romance
within the group, right?

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:18.377
{\an8}For example, William and Izaya are
in the fun phase of their relationship

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.513
{\an8}and, of course, want to get intimate.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:24.684
{\an8}But they realize they should hold back
out of consideration for others.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.086
{\an8}But this is
an incredibly romantic setting.

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.522
{\an8}What they're doing
is very considerate, right?

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.090
{\an8}But it's really difficult to tell

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.426
{\an8}how much intimacy is appropriate,
isn't it?

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:35.461
{\an8}It's hard to find the right balance, yeah.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.430
{\an8}I think they went pretty far though!

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.298
{\an8}Yeah, they were pretty intimate.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.435
{\an8}Yeah, sharing earphones shows
they were pretty intimate, doesn't it?

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.938
Izaya was gently rubbing his head
against William earlier.

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:49.308
- Yes, we saw that. We saw.
- Rubbing his head against him.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.410
- That was cute.
- How fun and very cute.

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.981
{\an8}- What are we doing tomorrow?
- The winner chooses.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.850
{\an8}- One person chooses?
- Right.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.553
{\an8}You choose a date
and then decide what you'll do.

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:03.189
{\an8}- Can't we decide together?
- The dates can decide together.

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:06.058
{\an8}If everyone decides to go snowboarding,
everyone goes snowboarding?

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.193
{\an8}Yeah, that's it.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.594
{\an8}Are you ready?

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:09.962
{\an8}Get set,

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.464
{\an8}go!

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.667
- He's strong.
- He's really strong.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.302
The start was…

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:25.377
Look how serious he is!

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.947
It's close.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.749
Hiroya wins.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.150
Go!

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:32.985
He's strong!

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:36.589
- There's that much difference?
- Yeah! He's strong!

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.058
{\an8}- That's impressive.
- Final match. The two best.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.960
{\an8}- This is the final?
- Ready?

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.962
{\an8}- This will be good.
- Two best arm-wrestlers.

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.363
I mean, look at our arms!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.832
You can see
the professional athlete concentrating.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.467
Ready?

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:50.302
Go!

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:53.839
- Oh wow! Huwei!
- You've got this, Izaya!

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.342
Huwei, Huwei!

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:57.343
Oh, he's strong.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.044
He won easily.

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:02.348
- Impressive. Just impressive.
- That was amazing.

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:04.517
Who do you choose?

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:06.619
Let me see.

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.388
Hmm.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.906
- I think I'll pass.
- What?

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.274
- What?
- What did he do?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.975
Why not? You won, after all.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.410
- For real?
- It's fine.

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.846
Are you sure? Is that your final answer?

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.215
Wait a minute, now I'm scared.
What should I do?

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.250
Well, then…

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.119
- You pass?
- I pass.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.854
- For real?
- It's fine.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.255
Are you serious?

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.191
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes, it's fine.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:46.725
So now it's Izaya, right?

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:47.760
- If I may?
- Yes.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.529
Then… I pick William.

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.665
- Okay.
- That's settled.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.837
- Next is Jobu.
- Who should I choose?

00:13:58.804 --> 00:13:59.638
I pick Huwei.

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.608
- Okay, sounds fun.
- We haven't really talked much.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.312
Next is Hiroya?

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.213
Well, then,

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:08.881
I pick Bomi.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.050
Okay.

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:14.220
Then I'll go with Ryu… who's left.

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.189
- Okay.
- Yay!

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.657
Yeah!

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:20.793
- What should we do?
- I won this for us.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.368
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.971
- Yay.
- Cheers.

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:33.505
Cheers.

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:38.110
- I knew Izaya would pick William.
- I was sure too.

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:40.312
- Yeah.
- Those two are already pretty solid.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.347
That's for sure.

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:43.716
With the level of trust they have,

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:47.786
I would've thought it wouldn't matter
if Izaya had picked someone else.

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:50.723
Or maybe it means they don't have
the level of trust you think.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.626
Yeah, of course. That's definitely
another way of seeing it.

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:54.827
I guess so.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.497
Huwei decided not to pick anyone himself.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.766
I was wondering why he did that.
That surprised me.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.434
He should've picked Bomi or someone.

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.336
- It's a mystery.
- That's for sure.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:05.905
Huwei is a mystery.

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:09.041
You ran the coffee truck with him, right?
You picked him.

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:12.211
I picked him…
because I was interested in him,

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.312
in knowing him.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:16.682
I wanted to know about
his past relationships, so I asked,

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.617
I told him I was interested in him.

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.386
Oh!

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:22.221
- That's so cool, mister!
- You think so? Okay.

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.122
That's courageous.

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:24.690
Is that something that surprises you?

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.158
I'm definitely surprised.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:29.295
I really had absolutely no idea at all
that you were interested in him.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.597
I thought you were going to pick me.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.300
- Sorry.
- Just kidding, don't worry.

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.068
Were you disappointed?

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.237
- Let's pick this up later?
- Of course.

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.039
- That's how it is.
- I get it.

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.775
Okay, let's talk about this.
Can we? Can we?

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.743
- Of course.
- It's a smaller group.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.146
- That's fine.
- Wonderful.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.350
Did you feel like you had a chance?

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.952
Well, it felt like…

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.955
- He did say, "Thank you, I'm happy."
- Mm.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:16:00.259
So I was kind of hoping I'd get an answer
on the next date or work shift.

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:01.827
But then he chose Bomi.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.697
At that point,
I thought I was out of the running.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.232
That's why I was pretty down that day.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:08.600
Mm.

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:11.236
I gradually started to cool down
pretty fast.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.539
- Mm.
- I still think you have a chance.

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.474
Yeah.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.176
- Want a drink?
- We forgot something.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.444
What'd you forget?

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.013
- You guys forget things a lot.
- There's a lot of stuff.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:22.948
Wanna talk over there?

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:23.916
Maybe?

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.719
- I'll meet you later.
- Okay, see you later.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.887
- We'll probably be up until one.
- Okay.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.157
Hiroya, I really don't get you, you know.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:34.126
I'm not good at expressing
my romantic feelings.

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:37.262
I don't know why you don't go for it more.
You could have asked Huwei

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.397
to sit with you on the bus.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.898
- Yeah, that's a good example.
- Maybe.

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:42.735
But you decided
to sit next to Bomi. Why did you do that?

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.836
You have a point.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.805
We all wondered for what reason
you sat next to him. It was weird.

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:47.873
I get it.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.075
I'll have to take the initiative.

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.111
You have to show him
that you haven't given up.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.046
Nothing'll happen if I wait around.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.918
Thank you. You've helped me understand
and sort things out.

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.654
I'll set the alarm for 6:30 a.m.

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.923
- That's early.
- Yeah, you're right.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.159
Then I'll set it for 6:35 a.m.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.094
- What about breakfast?
- I wanna go.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.629
We should have breakfast together.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.398
Can you go? Are you okay?

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.066
- I want you to wake me up.
- Okay.

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:17.036
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.558
We're leaving now to have breakfast.

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:52.938
- What?
- Wow!

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.940
- Is that okay?
- Will they do it?

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:56.375
It's morning, after all.

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:07.286
- They're holding hands.
- They are?

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.407
He kissed his hand!

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.375
He kissed his hand!

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.912
Wow, they're moving their relationship
forward so smoothly, don't you think?

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.782
- That kind of lazy morning vibe is nice.
- It is.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.017
Everyone else has gone,
leaving just the two of them.

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.219
It feels kind of secretive.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.821
- It's kind of sexy.
- I don't know what you mean.

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.890
"It got quiet. No one's here anymore."

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.658
Yeah, you know it. It's so sexy.

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:50.629
- How nice of everyone to leave!
- Do it already! Just go for it!

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.431
- This is their chance.
- Go for it!

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:55.601
- It's a matter of time before they kiss.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:09.248
{\an8}At this rate,
he'll probably start doing jumps too.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.083
Oh no, I'm in trouble! It's too soft!

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.417
The snow here is really soft!

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:13.619
Too soft?

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:14.820
The view's incredible.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.890
Wow, he's right.
The view really is incredible. I wanna go!

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:20.092
This is so exciting.
I love discovering stores.

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.994
- Do you know about glass beads?
- I don't.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.996
- Glass beads are cute.
- They are?

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.098
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.132
- Hello.
- Oh wow.

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.634
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.936
- Thank you for having us.
- Here for the workshop?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.337
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:33.906
There are six designs in total

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:36.141
{\an8}to choose from
in our glass bead collection.

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:38.310
And for a limited time,
you can add another bead,

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.112
called a sakura bead, inside.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.314
- Wait a minute.
- These are very pretty.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.016
And spring isn't even that far away.

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:47.819
{\an8}You want to heat the tip
above the invisible part of the flame.

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.054
{\an8}If you hold it too close,

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.256
{\an8}the difference in temperature
will make the glass crack,

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:52.424
{\an8}so hold it steady.

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.092
{\an8}Since it tends to widen,

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:55.994
{\an8}every now and then,
bring it back to the middle

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.263
{\an8}to straighten it out.
Yes, that's very good.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.598
{\an8}Okay, now pull it toward you.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:02.267
{\an8}- He's so cute.
- He really is!

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:05.871
- Place it on the sakura bead.
- Just how cute is that?

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.907
- Bomi seems like he'd be good at this.
- Yeah.

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:13.312
He really does look like
he knows what he's doing, doesn't he?

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.980
This is delicate work.

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:20.219
{\an8}Okay, everyone,
please change your jackets. Okay?

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:25.791
This might be too small for me.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.760
- Wow, that's so cool.
- So cool.

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:31.863
Today, we have Monaka and Daifuku.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.765
- Daifuku?
- That's right.

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:35.167
- Cute.
- Cute.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.869
- I'll take Daifuku, then.
- Daifuku? I'll take Monaka.

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.705
That's perfect.

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:42.341
Monaka, nice to meet you.

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:44.776
It's just like getting up on a bike. Up!

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:46.478
Okay, very good.

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.648
Okay, everyone, come on. We're leaving.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:56.555
- The setting is gorgeous.
- It's beautiful and so relaxing.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.958
- Wow!
- Isn't this amazing?

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:02.294
- It's absolutely amazing.
- Incredible.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.763
You don't see things
from this height often.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.632
That's true.

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.100
Wow, amazing.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.069
As you can see, the snow is pretty deep.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.540
Monaka is getting a little too close,
so let's pick up the pace, Daifuku.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.042
Go, Daifuku!

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.212
Monaka is used to always
walking right behind Daifuku.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.179
I get it.

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.882
Monaka loves Daifuku
and wants to kiss its butt.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.617
Now I really get it.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:26.885
That's sweet.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.654
- That's like Izaya.
- What?

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.789
He follows me.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.557
Cute.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.931
Okay, we're back.
Thank you very much, everyone.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.334
- Thank you, Monaka.
- You're welcome.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.502
Thank you.

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:45.370
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.542
How was the date?

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.311
- With Bomi?
- Yeah.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.513
Everything went well.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.649
But it wasn't anything more than that,
you know?

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.451
I can't believe it!

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:04.022
I kind of feel like I need…
to nurture my feelings, you know?

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.392
Figure things out a little more
before I can act on them.

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:09.895
Yeah, I get it.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.831
Who are you interested in?

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:14.466
I had chosen William.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:17.736
- It was always him?
- Yeah, it was him from the start.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.372
But those two are very close.

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.074
- Yeah, they are.
- It's obvious.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.512
I wonder how far
those two have already gone.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:30.649
No idea.
I haven't really asked about that.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:35.120
You know, I know nothing
about your past relationships.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:39.691
My ex and I… were together
for almost three years.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.927
We broke up over a year ago.

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:44.963
It was my first relationship,
and I was young.

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:47.966
So I think I was really selfish.

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.738
Do you feel like
he kind of pushed you around?

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:56.475
Not at all. It wasn't like that.
At the end, my partner brought it up.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.144
You were thinking of breaking up
but couldn't tell him, then he did?

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.680
Yeah, that's what happened.
He talked about it first.

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:06.318
It was still tough.

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:08.820
I think I cried enough for a lifetime.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:10.789
- For real.
- What? You really cry?

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.290
I don't usually cry.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:16.294
But during that time,
I even surprised myself.

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.897
I never thought I could cry that much.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.639
I feel really bad for you
for being paired with me.

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.641
There's no reason to feel that way.

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:32.844
Lately, I've been remembering things

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:37.482
about how my ex and I first met,
about when and how we started dating,

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:39.117
like I told you the other day.

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:43.255
Talking about everything
brought back memories of what it was like.

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.223
It made you cry.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.759
- It didn't make me cry.
- Your eyes were teary.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.694
Yeah, you're right. It was pretty bad.

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.830
Fifteen years…

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:55.734
There were so many things I had forgotten
until I looked back on them.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.670
When we first started dating,

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:01.773
people around us would say things like,
"Why are you dating someone like him?"

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.341
They'd say that about me.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:07.846
But if I had been the popular guy,
then people around us would've…

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:08.780
…been jealous.

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.015
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:13.385
He told me, "It doesn't matter
what people around us say."

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:17.689
"It will only reflect poorly on them,
and it won't change a thing between us."

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:19.357
That's so beautiful.

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:23.094
I want a partner like that.

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.335
Cheers.

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:34.439
I'm gonna be honest. I wanted to ask,

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:36.975
who do you really like
in our group right now?

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.178
Honestly, I don't think
I've gotten to the phase

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.180
where I really like anyone yet.

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.548
What about Huwei?

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:47.319
Okay, yeah.
There is Huwei that I like, but…

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.921
You're wondering
whether to take it a step further?

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.556
I can't take that step yet.

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.058
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:56.228
For that date outing,
I, too, wrote Huwei's name.

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:58.263
I kind of had a feeling you had…

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:01.666
that you were taking
some kind of initiative

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.368
with regards to Huwei.

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:05.303
Yesterday as well.

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:08.940
I was sure Huwei was gonna choose you
as his partner.

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:12.811
The thing is, the question isn't
why he didn't choose me.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:16.381
Huwei's been saying for a while
that he wants to go snowboarding.

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:20.652
And, apparently,
he really wants to go with Jobu.

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:22.153
Then why not chose him?

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.823
I'm sure it's because he had
mixed feelings about it.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.492
I was there in front of him,
and you were also there.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.295
He probably had a lot of mixed feelings
and couldn't choose.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:33.431
- I guess. Yeah, maybe that's it.
- Yeah.

00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:35.267
Oh, thank you very much.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:38.637
It's a kumquat
and Shonai persimmons salad. Enjoy.

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:39.838
It looks delicious.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:41.606
This is venison.

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.875
Venison? This'll be my first time.

00:25:44.743 --> 00:25:47.145
I didn't know
venison was served in blocks like this.

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.747
What do you like about him?

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:50.549
- Huwei?
- Mm.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.551
Well, Huwei…

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.687
Everyone says he's cute,

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:59.591
but, for me, his appeal as a person
goes way beyond that.

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:06.731
Right now, I know this crush is one-sided.
At least that's what I think.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.802
I know it's something
I need to confirm with him

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.272
before I can start thinking about
or doing anything else.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.843
First thing to do,

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.346
I need to set a meeting up with Huwei
so we can talk.

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.081
Is that okay?

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:26.117
Why are you asking me?
Of course it's okay.

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:29.220
They're too good friends to be rivals.

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:30.922
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:41.833
{\an8}HEY, HUWEI

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.401
{\an8}What? Just like that?

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:47.072
{\an8}LET'S TALK TONIGHT, JUST THE TWO OF US

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.007
{\an8}Well, he sent the text.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:54.012
{\an8}I wonder what Huwei thinks about
these two having lunch together,

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.814
{\an8}or rather going on a date.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.815
{\an8}SURE!!

00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.850
{\an8}- Sure!
- Sure!

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.685
{\an8}That's so cute.

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:01.886
What is it?

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:06.524
- No, it's nothing.
- Nothing?

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.036
- How are you liking the trip?
- It's going by too fast.

00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:20.905
We went to sleep together
for the first time.

00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:23.174
- We did.
- We've slept apart until now.

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:27.946
Even though we had to share
a large sleeping space with the others,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.715
I got to sleep next to you
for the first time,

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.184
so I was restless.

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:38.923
It was a new feeling, wouldn't you say?

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.893
A fresh feeling or a fresh start feeling.

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:45.597
As we spend more and more time together,

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:51.002
I can feel that you're really expressing
your true feelings for me,

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.372
or rather that you're focusing on me.

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.542
At first, I was a little bit confused.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.413
I didn't know if I could live up to them.

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:07.819
That's why I was really nervous
and a little worried too, maybe.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:12.157
I don't know. I can't really describe
this feeling that I had.

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:13.191
Mm.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.527
But now,

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:17.962
I'm just happy.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.897
Aw!

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:21.700
I trace your name in this…

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:23.234
- When our hands touched…
- Yeah.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:27.672
That… feeling has been with me all day.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:28.606
Mm.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:32.177
I realized today
how important physical contact is.

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.747
'Cause we've never touched
like that before.

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:40.518
So to spend this much time with someone
I feel so highly drawn to…

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.120
It's mutual.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:45.156
I think my feelings are in motion.

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:48.460
So, Izaya…

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:52.530
I don't see myself with anyone else.

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.299
I'm happy.

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.868
If I feel this way, maybe I'm already…

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.705
I'm starting to wonder
if maybe I already like you.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:04.909
With love…

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:06.845
I'm happy.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.647
…the sky above

00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:12.016
And rise a little higher…

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.518
I'll always be here for you.

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:18.223
And… once I've made up my mind on someone,

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:22.093
I'm confident I can make it last.

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:27.298
So just believe in me
and know you can trust me.

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.104
I hope this feeling lasts forever.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.672
Mm.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.276
It will last.

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:42.647
Closer again

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:46.484
Wow, that was so good.
It was like something out of a movie.

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.820
- Congratulations to them.
- You're right.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.856
{\an8}They both took the time they needed
to build up their emotions,

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.359
{\an8}and now, "I think maybe I like him."

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.528
{\an8}I'm glad Izaya's feelings got through.

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.696
{\an8}- Yes!
- That was really a happy moment.

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:02.433
"The warmth of your hand is
still with me," even in such a cold place.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.736
{\an8}- Isn't that amazing?
- He could still feel it.

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:07.572
{\an8}His hands were numb.
That's why he thought he could feel it.

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.873
{\an8}He could feel it.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.144
{\an8}So we can't say that they're
officially together yet, right?

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.279
{\an8}Not officially.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:17.248
{\an8}But once you get to that phase,
you usually want to let people know

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.717
{\an8}that you're officially together
in a relationship.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.953
{\an8}I just want them
to graduate from the show already.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.889
{\an8}Yes, but let's not forget
that they have a schedule to follow,

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:27.959
{\an8}so maybe they're planning on waiting
until the end of the show

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:30.028
{\an8}to give their official answer.

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:33.565
{\an8}I wonder if these two ever talk about
anything trivial when they're alone.

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:34.966
{\an8}That's a good question.

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:39.037
{\an8}I mean, they're always having
deep, very serious conversations.

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.372
{\an8}"Hey, look, doesn't that tree
look like it has a face?"

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.775
{\an8}Do they ever say stuff like that
to each other?

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:46.211
{\an8}Or like, "No, that tree over there
looks like a face."

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:47.111
{\an8}Something like that.

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:50.181
{\an8}William still seems a little timid
or scared if you ask me.

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:53.651
It's his first time being in
a serious relationship, after all.

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:57.188
{\an8}I liked the part where they said,
"Will this last?" "Yes, it will!"

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:59.757
{\an8}When William wavers,
Izaya, bam, puts him on track.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:01.593
{\an8}- "Stay on track."
- "Focus."

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:02.594
{\an8}It will last.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.630
{\an8}But William hasn't said
that he likes him yet.

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.131
{\an8}- He hasn't.
- He's starting to wonder.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:10.835
{\an8}Yeah, and he also said something like,
"I don't see myself with anyone else".

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.205
{\an8}The thing we all need to understand
is that, when you meet someone

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:16.908
{\an8}or find something
that becomes precious to you,

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.910
{\an8}once it's in your life,

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.180
{\an8}you realize
it comes with the fear of losing it.

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:23.114
{\an8}Yes, the fear.

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:27.218
{\an8}However, to face that fear,
you need the determination to accept it.

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:31.923
{\an8}Maybe William is trying to evaluate
if he has that determination within him.

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.725
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah.

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:35.727
- I'm excited.
- We can finally eat.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:39.163
Do you think it's
that fancy building we can see over there?

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:41.165
Oh, you mean that one?

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:43.101
- This is it?
- This looks really nice.

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:45.536
- This is so fancy.
- This is really nice.

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:47.238
- Wow, this is amazing.
- Oh, wow.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.340
- How fancy.
- Yeah, it is.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.675
It's so nice.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.744
- This is nice.
- It's beautiful.

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.680
- Cheers!
- To our last night.

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.982
To our last night in Niseko.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:00.151
Cheers!

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:01.085
To us.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.488
Something awesome is coming.

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:05.990
I don't know how to eat this.

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.759
We only eat the top part, right?

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:09.260
Yeah. Let's taste this.

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.296
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.330
Oh!

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:14.866
The foie gras is amazing.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.935
I love foie gras.

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:19.404
- It's super rich.
- Yeah.

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:25.176
- Who has a fond memory?
- A fond memory?

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:27.912
- That sounds dangerous.
- It is dangerous.

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:29.614
Do you have a fond memory?

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:34.352
I do. My previous… partner,

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:40.158
when he invited me
to his college cultural festival,

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:44.696
he asked me to come to his clubroom
to introduce me.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.564
So I went with him,

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:48.266
and he introduced me,

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.001
and later that night,

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.570
I caught a glimpse of his group chat.

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:56.374
I saw, "Isn't he super cute?"
"Yes, he is,"

00:32:56.441 --> 00:33:00.912
and I was super happy
that… he was bragging about me. Yeah.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.113
- That's nice.
- Cute.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.081
- That's cute.
- It is.

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.916
That's a great story. A fond memory.

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:08.086
- That was a cute, heartwarming story.
- What a great memory.

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.522
Do you have a memory?

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:14.692
Mm…

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:21.265
There is one, but I can't.
Give me a moment.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:25.570
He's rubbing his back.

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.172
Hmm, it's a bit… Hmm.

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.208
You don't have to force yourself.

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:31.275
Okay.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.379
I can't share this yet.

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:37.682
- Why is he touching him?
- Enough. Stop touching him.

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:39.917
William.

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:43.988
{\an8}Here we go.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.357
{\an8}I have to talk about it anyway
to work through it.

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:47.892
{\an8}It's important.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:50.028
{\an8}A fond memory, right?

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.264
He was such a kind person.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:58.002
Probably the kindest person
I've ever met in my life.

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.939
One day, it was raining really hard,

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.009
and he held an umbrella for me.

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:08.179
When we got to our destination,

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.281
he was soaking wet.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:12.950
Just him, not me.

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:17.188
Whenever we would watch…
a movie or something,

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:22.994
he would… always cry a lot
at all the sad or heartfelt moments.

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:26.731
He would always say things like,
"That's so sad," or "That's so sweet."

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.665
I saw him cry a lot.

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:33.371
It was all those… little things
that made his kindness deep inside

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.239
shine for everyone to see.

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:39.677
And I remember each and every one
of those precious moments so vividly.

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.814
Poor Kazuyuki!

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.983
I think he sees himself
in the man Jobu described.

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:47.985
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:51.155
It just brought back
a lot of memories for me.

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:53.257
What did you remember?

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:56.427
I remembered the same thing used to happen
when we watched movies,

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.129
but I was the one who cried.

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:02.233
I'd cry, and after the movie, he'd say,

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.502
"You were crying so hard next to me

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:06.938
that, in fact,
I started laughing instead."

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:09.574
I remembered how he used to say that.

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.145
I don't have fond memories.

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.647
Of your last partner?

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.516
- Should he go there?
- Don't say anything weird.

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.952
Don't forget Izaya's watching you.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:25.223
Does everybody know how a bad memory
can stay stuck in your mind?

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.958
Yeah, it just stays burned in your head.

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:29.660
I have bad memories
of everyone I've dated so far,

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:32.263
but if I focus only on the good moments,

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.265
there were lots of them.

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:37.235
But the fondest memory I have

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.971
is from the last partner I was with.

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.506
I decided to move

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:44.108
and left Japan for Barcelona
for the very first time.

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.745
Once I was there,
I didn't have any friends at all.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:51.149
Finally, I ended up meeting someone
through an app.

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.683
He was German,

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.252
and, little by little,

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:57.655
he started visiting me
every weekend from Germany.

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:00.324
That went on for two or three weeks.

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.427
One day, he asked me
to go with him to Germany.

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:07.198
On that trip,
he introduced me to his family.

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:10.234
That was the first time it happened to me,
and I was 32.

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:14.772
It's always been my dream
to be introduced to someone's family.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.243
So, imagine, it was the first time
my dream was coming true.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.748
It feels like they're saying,
"Let's become a family," right?

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:27.151
That's when I realized
that I was accepted as family.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.187
So I guess my next dream

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:32.790
was to introduce someone
I had really come to love

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.659
to my mother and father.

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:39.030
I wanted to be able to do that.
That's a fond memory for me.

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:41.699
I know I should focus more on them.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.368
Humans are so flawed.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:49.774
I think maybe I'm carrying
a lot of trauma inside of me.

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:53.411
My ex was always very expressive
with his affection.

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:55.947
He'd say things like, "I like you,"
or, "I love you."

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:59.617
He would say things like, "I love you
just as much as the day I met you,"

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.652
or, "I can't live without you."

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.054
His words moved me,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.122
and just when I thought he was the one,

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.558
he completely blocked me on social media.

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.627
I couldn't contact him,
so I went to Germany.

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:13.798
I went to his house,
rang the doorbell, and waited,

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:16.367
but even after an hour,
he didn't come down.

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:20.137
He told me he loved me every day
until the day before,

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:24.242
so I didn't understand
why… he wouldn't open the door for me.

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.310
And because of that,

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.714
when someone tells me they like me, well,

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:33.451
I tend to not really believe
what they say.

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.887
I can't bring myself to trust them.

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:39.156
I think they'll do the same thing.

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.670
- So someone hurt him.
- That's harsh.

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:55.740
Getting blocked for no reason
must be really traumatizing.

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:58.109
That's why he gets anxious
when someone says they like him.

00:37:58.175 --> 00:38:00.845
- Now I understand.
- It's a way to protect himself.

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:10.921
{\an8}I'M AT THE BAR ON THE FIRST FLOOR

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:11.956
{\an8}OKAY

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.891
{\an8}- "Okay."
- Now…

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.661
What will he say?

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.231
You're here.
I didn't know there was a place like this.

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:21.866
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah, it is.

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:23.334
Thanks for coming.

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:28.239
- This is a really nice place.
- Yeah.

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.241
Cheers.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.515
- It's good.
- Mm.

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:41.552
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:45.456
The other day,
I thought I had made myself clear to you

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:47.391
when I said I have feelings for you.

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:48.526
Mm.

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:51.195
But I haven't gotten a response from you.

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.496
Not a response, but…

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:56.067
Honestly, I have no idea how you feel
about what I told you.

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:56.967
Mm.

00:38:57.034 --> 00:38:59.837
That's why I asked you here
to talk about it.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:03.607
I'm having a hard time understanding you.

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.576
Like your decision last night.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.479
You won the arm wrestling contest.

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.848
But then you didn't choose anyone.

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:16.454
You're right. It's confusing, isn't it?
Everyone says so.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.689
I don't think anybody in the group…

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.293
really understands you.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.261
Mm.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.963
Well, to be perfectly honest,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.399
I was torn between three people.

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:29.834
Mm.

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:34.372
There was Jobu,

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.240
there was Bomi,

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.042
and Ryuki.

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:41.512
Oh.

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.614
So I wasn't one of the options.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.882
No, you weren't.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:46.784
Okay.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:49.353
Ooh!

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.155
Now, that's rough!

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.657
I really don't think…

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.763
…I feel that way about you, Hiroya.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.466
So you want to focus on Bomi for now?

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:04.635
- Yeah.
- That's good.

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:05.536
Yeah.

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:09.340
You know, with Bomi,
my feelings for him are different, but…

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.508
I know what you mean.

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.610
They're different,
but there's a part of me

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:16.347
that's still not sure what I feel
or if I actually like him or not.

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.515
I need to figure it out.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:22.219
- So you're not even sure if you like him.
- Yeah. I'm not sure.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.455
- I wonder why.
- Okay.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:27.525
I think you need to go find love.

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.826
I need to find it.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.328
- You're right.
- I really hope you do.

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:34.064
Thanks, man. You're right.

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.871
- It's okay.
- Let's enjoy the time we have left.

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:41.772
Thank you.

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:43.908
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:55.419
- Oh, that's so sad.
- Poor thing.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:58.923
- Out of the three, he wasn't one of them?
- Exactly.

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.624
He wasn't an option. Can you believe that?

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.793
If he had to give three names,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.930
he very well could've given four
and included Hiroya's name.

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:09.033
Huwei, he's just
always so brutally honest.

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:11.202
- Yeah, he really can't lie.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:12.703
That was so much fun.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:13.771
It really was.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.740
- We got to do a lot of things.
- We're already leaving.

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:19.376
- It went by fast.
- I wish we could've stayed longer.

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:22.513
Yeah. You're right,
but I kind of miss life in the Green Room.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.714
Yeah.

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.016
Today, I got 'em.

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.319
Hmm, where should I sit?

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:40.865
Hi.

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:54.445
- Look at the view.
- The mountains are amazing.

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:03.153
Why is Izaya staring
and William not looking back?

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.457
What's on your mind?

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.393
- A lot of things.
- A lot of things?

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.796
And are you thinking about them
in a good or a bad way?

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.132
In every way.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.201
I don't know if it's in a good way.

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.936
- Okay.
- He's being negative.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.971
- It's his trauma.
- He has trauma.

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.473
Don't start getting anxious.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.275
How…

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.044
how should I put this?

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.748
I wonder if you feel this way
because of our situation.

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.016
Hmm.

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:33.250
Don't you wonder?

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:35.419
That's never crossed my mind.

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.258
What if, when you leave this place,

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:44.428
you suddenly realize you weren't… into me

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:46.730
as much as you thought you were?

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:51.001
Nothing is certain, you know.

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:54.238
I agree that nothing is certain,
but I'm willing to take that risk

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.340
in order to be with you.

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:58.876
It's hot.

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.210
Mm.

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:06.750
It's hard to trust when someone says,
"I love you forever,"

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:09.019
but then they end up
losing interest in you.

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:17.528
Do you think that, whatever the issue
that's bothering you right now,

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:22.700
could eventually be… resolved
during the course of this experience?

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.036
I don't know.

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:29.640
I'm curious to know that as well.

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.609
I need to know if it's possible.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.577
Seriously.

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:41.719
When something new
is about to begin in my life,

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.420
I remember things,

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:46.056
and the after-dinner conversation
triggered a lot.

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:50.661
It was something
I'd been holding in for a long time.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.752
What I mean is,

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:17.855
you say things like, "I won't change,"
or, "I'm serious,"

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:23.127
and, in fact, I just wanna know
where all this… is coming from, you know?

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:30.267
{\an8}My mother passed away when I was 21.
Since then,

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.970
I think that, because of her death,

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.773
the way I am with people has changed.

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:40.477
Oh no.

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:41.512
I think…

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:50.287
I regret not having been able
to express my love for her more easily.

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.122
But maybe that's…

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.629
…what made me who I am today.

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.808
You have no way of knowing

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.544
when someone dear to you might die.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.316
That's why

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:23.287
if I have someone I care for in my life,

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.957
I want to be able to express my feelings…

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.063
…through both words and actions.

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:39.136
I need to be able
to fully express my feelings.

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:41.538
It comes from there.

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:58.756
So there are things I wanna work on,

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:02.292
and I was hoping
that I could work on them with you.

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:05.095
For example…

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.433
I want you to know

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.802
that I'm serious about this.

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.139
I only do it with people I like.

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.241
No way.

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:19.576
Of course it's true.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:24.515
I wonder what exactly
is so great about me.

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.318
I guess everything.

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:33.123
Like… the way you express your feelings

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.993
without holding anything back.

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:37.828
I really like that about you.

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.898
I'll always be here for you.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.567
Once I've made up my mind on someone,

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:46.970
I'm confident I can make it last.

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.207
So just believe in me

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.709
and know you can trust me.

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:28.879
- Intense.
- So now we understand everything.

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:31.448
{\an8}So that's why Izaya was so straightforward

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:35.185
{\an8}and honest about what he was feeling
with William, right?

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:38.488
{\an8}I was wondering before
why Izaya was acting that way,

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:41.058
{\an8}especially so early on,
but now we understand.

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:41.959
{\an8}Seriously.

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:44.361
{\an8}You can tell
that he wasn't lying about any of this.

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:46.630
{\an8}He expressed himself
in a very clear manner.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:50.300
{\an8}Now, will William still feel anxious
of anything Izaya says?

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.636
{\an8}Or will he change
and try to believe in him?

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:55.239
{\an8}That will determine
where this couple goes from here.
