WEBVTT

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.360
Take care.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.720
Xiao.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.860
Let's go. Let's go.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.800
Let's go.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.240
Let's continue to eat.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.090
Let me heat it up for you.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.640
This is so similar.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.760
Amazing.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.020
Let's eat together

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.040
Did you wash your pot?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.200
Yes.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.579
What are you doing?

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.960
What are you doing?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.360
I think

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.360
you and Yang Debiao are quite close.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600
You don't like me enough.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.800
I'll cook myself.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.040
It's so big.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.600
I can't cook it in one pot.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.640
This painting is very thoughtful.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.960
Keep it in mind.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.920
It's so vivid.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.970
How many times do you have to see him

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.120
to make it so vivid?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400
Not many times.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.520
Of course not as many times as we met.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.680
Then draw me.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.800
Let me see.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.079
Then draw me too.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.960
You've seen me

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.840
than Miss Yang.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:43.800
Okay.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.760
Let's draw one for each other.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.290
Let's go.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.800
Let's go. Let's go.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.320
Let me see.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.240
What if

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.120
like mine,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.320
is real.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.680
to judge whether a woman likes me or not.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.120
I think you hate me.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.080
Now that I think about it,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.320
I think you hate me too.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.680
So,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.240
You're wrong.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.480
Let's say I'm talking nonsense.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.800
But

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.000
you can't have too much contact with Yang Debiao.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.120
I'm dead.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.250
How can I have so much contact with her?

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
That makes sense.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
From now on,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760
you'll be my little baby.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.520
I'll lock you up in your room every day.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.680
You can't go anywhere.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.240
I won't go anywhere even if you don't lock me up.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.200
So this house

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.600
will be your whole world.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.680
That's my little treasure.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.640
I...

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.680
Are you flirting or not?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.240
Yes.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.360
Do you like it?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.000
I'll do it every day.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.700
Who would have thought

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.440
the best one for a girl

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.200
is the best general of Tang, Xu Ziqi.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.120
I...

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.520
Baby, do the dishes at home.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.080
I need to focus on my career.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.320
To put it bluntly, the contract has been signed.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.120
we'll accept the compensation.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.080
I just hope that after you take over the painting,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.640
don't raise the price and don't make fake goods.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.560
This brand is for you.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.560
That's the formula.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.640
As long as you follow the recipe,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.930
you can make a lot of money without raising the price.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.980
You came all the way here today

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.200
to tell me this?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.260
Actually, I'm here to say goodbye to you.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.770
When Xu Ziqi is gone,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.640
you will leave Chang'an.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.530
I won't leave Chang'an.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.560
But from now on,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.000
we don't need to contact each other anymore.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.560
Why?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
Separate hatred?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.560
Why did Jin'er become

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.640
for three years?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.360
How can you keep

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.560
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.760
I guess so.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.000
But I never thought

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.580
your intelligence and calculation would be used on me.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.120
But after the incident,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.680
I can't trust you anymore.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.200
Since we're on different sides,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.530
let's part ways nicely.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.960
Different stations.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.200
Zheng,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.880
Are you still going to go against the Chamber of Commerce?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.080
Fight?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.130
Not against each other.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.440
There are many different ways

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.640
in this world.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.080
But we chose different

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.240
We can try to live together.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.640
It just takes a long process.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.440
Zheng.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.760
Xu Ziqi is gone.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.520
We can start over.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.560
But I don't like you.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.000
You did.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.680
You said you liked it.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.090
At that time, I couldn't see my heart clearly.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.120
I thought I liked you.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.880
Actually not.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.820
The person I like has always been Xu Ziqi.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.760
Xu Ziqi is gone.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.400
and will never come back.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.220
You still have to like him.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.120
I'll always like him.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.200
Are you crazy?

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.080
It's meaningless

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320
and not worth it.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.040
This is the biggest difference between us.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.960
You need to calculate everything.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.400
But there are not so many calculations in love.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.320
I'm here to say goodbye.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.440
I don't want to argue with you.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.320
I'm leaving.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.320
You want to leave the Chamber of Commerce?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.000
to leave the Chamber of Commerce.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.679
But we have to settle the penalty.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120
Contract damage?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.720
I thought you were just throwing a tantrum

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.360
and your little dispute.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.320
So I didn't argue with you

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.720
Now that you're leaving,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.050
I have to tell you the condition of leaving the Chamber of Commerce.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.320
500 taels of silver.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.840
Are you sure? Yes.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.480
I can ask Yang Lin

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.160
to show you the details.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.680
It's true.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.960
It has been written

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.240
on the rules of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.320
But you are the first one

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.560
you're the first one to leave the Chamber of Commerce.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.440
You must pay it back in a month after you leave the Chamber of Commerce.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.320
Otherwise, we'll go to the court for a lawsuit.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.680
OK. OK.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.800
One month.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.960
Here.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.400
My lord, love

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.920
shouldn't be forced.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.200
Moreover,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.320
the Chamber of Commerce is in a mess.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.040
Why don't we just let go of Ms. Zheng?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.920
I can't.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.080
The brand new beauty product

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.320
is about to be launched.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.200
It's still a traditional recipe.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200
Beautiful color

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.160
Show the most beautiful you

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.960
Okay.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.400
The Carp League personally escorts it.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.920
full carriages.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.480
to meet all the ladies' needs.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.200
Yes, we can give you

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.440
we can give you.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.960
your sisters.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.280
Ask your auntie

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.730
and order together.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.960
Pave the way for your beauty.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.480
Nice.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.680
I didn't expect it to be so popular.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.080
Yeah.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:26.840
So many people.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.800
Of course.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.380
Who came up with this idea?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440
Zheng is amazing.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.920
Let's celebrate.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.020
Let's have a drink.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.440
I didn't expect it to be so successful.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.200
Cheers!

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680
Cheers! Cheers!

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.080
Cheers!

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.200
So handsome!

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.940
You are so good at picking.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.480
You're so pretty.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.480
Of course.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.080
Look who picked them.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.840
And I picked them out

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.200
from the Lucky Carp Alliance.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.680
Although Second Master is usually fierce,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.560
to decorate his beard and hairstyle.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.840
Put on the uniform.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.200
Isn’t it so manly?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.400
I didn’t expect you to be so charming.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.560
They used to like handsome guys like me.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.320
Now,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.280
like a big man like Second Master.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.200
Exactly.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680
When can I

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.800
become like them?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.960
It's not about training.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.160
It's about food.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.320
Eat.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.320
Brother.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.370
Brother.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.720
Miss Xiao.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.320
All the leaflets

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.680
all the leaflets.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.080
I didn't expect

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.840
the trick of ex-sister-in-law

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.440
is awesome.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.320
Am I right?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.440
Roar.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.800
Look at this.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.560
What are you wearing?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.440
Go get changed.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.480
Brother.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840
Don't you think

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.440
I'm handsome?

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.040
Look.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.560
It's really good.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.160
Take it off.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.920
Get changed.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.440
Go.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.610
Hurry up.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.560
What do you usually

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.920
usually eat?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.480
You know

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.960
I love eggs.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.380
Eight for one meal.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.840
Cook eggs.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.560
Is it good?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.160
Yes.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.480
It smells so good.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.610
I'll take you there.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.800
Lord Wu found out.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.320
Xu Ziqi

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.840
was sent by the court to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.970
The Imperial Agent?

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.820
Not only is he not dead,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.800
he also hides in the inner courtyard

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.860
and spend the night with Hua Xiaochi.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.480
He's really capable.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.080
How can the government be against our Chamber of Commerce?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.040
All these years,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.080
spies have been attacking our Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.040
No matter how much they smash,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.640
no matter how hard I smash it.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.200
Master Yi.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.960
What do you mean?

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.240
As long as you investigate the spy of our Chamber of Commerce,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.400
no one can go back alive.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.920
Since Xu Ziqi has faked his death,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.400
let him die.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.720
I'm so happy.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.440
Here.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.880
Come on.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.080
Happy.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.320
Yang Lin.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.440
Don't you think something is wrong?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200
Xu Ziqi is dead.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.800
Why is Hua Xiaochi so happy?

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.800
She's always optimistic.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.680
Forcing a smile

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.960
It's reasonable to try to survive.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.440
The more I think about it, the more I feel something is wrong.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.680
Who is Xu Ziqi?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.740
How could he die in an accident so easily?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.460
You must be worrying too much.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.400
I'm afraid he can't accept

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.080
that Lord Xu has passed away.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.400
I can accept it.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.560
I just think

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.800
he's not dead at all.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.920
What?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.680
I just don't like it.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.840
You don't want to be with me anymore.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.720
I'm tired of it.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.720
Talk nicely.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.560
I'll talk nicely.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.700
You weren't like this before.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.280
I think you've changed.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.740
You don't love me anymore.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.920
Look.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.900
These are the information of all cavalries.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.200
It's an application document

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.160
who pressed the fingerprint.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.840
The cavalries and I are innocent.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.080
Mr. Zhang,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.680
Is he here to discuss the candidate with you?

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.480
I was on the beam.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.720
I heard it clearly.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.460
You can choose anyone.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.560
It's fine to look at his face.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.800
What are you doing?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.200
I'm on the beam.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.210
Did you touch her in front of me?

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.680
How would I know if I didn't touch him?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.010
if his muscles are good.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.320
Didn't Zhang Gui say he'll touch it for you?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.560
Then why did you touch it yourself?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.490
You're almost thrown into the pot.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.400
You know.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.440
That's my hobby.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.320
Well,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.580
If you want to touch it,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.480
You...

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.720
Touch me.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.680
Not bad.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.160
Well...

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.160
My abs are good.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840
It's really good.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.920
Well,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.680
Is my muscle better or their muscle?

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.280
It must be my baby.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.560
is the best, right?

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.480
Yes.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320
You're the best.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.920
Don't touch me again.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.200
Look.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.600
Is there

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.400
Are they setting off fireworks?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:18.960
Bad news.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.160
Let's go. Put it on.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.090
Let's go.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.680
Our home.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.560
Let's go in.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.090
It must be safe here.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.880
Right here.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.160
Zheng.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.960
Wait here.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.280
I'll light the fire first.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.680
Okay.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.720
This is

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.840
is my family's grave.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.130
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.960
Your family is sleeping here.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.880
Yes.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.920
All my family

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.000
fell asleep here.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.760
All the heroes here are protecting us.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.400
How could I be afraid?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.240
Xu Ziqi.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.640
I'm sorry.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.460
You're bleeding a lot.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.340
Where's the haemostatic you carry with you?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.810
I won't apply medicine on you anymore.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.160
Xu Ziqi.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.360
Can you stop getting hurt?

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.480
You know I'll be sad if you get hurt.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.400
I'm worried that I'll be sad?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.120
This is my family.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.760
They'll think I'm bullying you.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.240
What if they hit me in my dream?

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.720
Your family must be as good as you.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.440
Come on.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.460
The one sleeping there

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.650
was my great-grandfather.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.200
the first general of our Xu family.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.040
The position.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.880
The founding general of Tang

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.000
With General Li Jing

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.640
with General Li Jing.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.370
...but to protect General Li Jing.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.570
...to protect General Li Jing.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.080
and chopped him to death.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.520
The one sleeping there

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.420
is my grandfather.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.200
He is not a general.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.280
He's just an honest scholar.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.360
When Danyang was in trouble,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.010
he was caught by Danyang

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.800
to threaten my ancestor.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.440
He killed himself.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.440
His head was chopped off.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.680
So the court

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.160
conferred his title as General.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.960
But what's the use?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.880
When he left,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.170
my grandmother was just pregnant.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.000
The one lying here

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.520
is me, Aye.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.240
I'll go with my Aye.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.200
We defeated Tugu Chaos.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.900
But I didn't expect

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.960
that was the last time I saw him.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.000
On our way back to Chang'an,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.920
the horse suddenly lost control

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.200
and threw me into the swamp.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.400
In order to save me,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.040
just to save me.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.040
He lifted me up.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.000
and

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.180
I was stuck in the swamp and couldn't get out.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.120
I was 14.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.960
We tried many ways

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.000
but we didn't get him out.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.960
I just watched him

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.600
disappear in front of me little by little.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.920
Later,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.010
I went back to Chang'an.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.480
My mother...

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.720
She... She was so sad.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.160
She was so sad

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.520
and went with me.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160
From that day on,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.160
I became an orphan.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.680
Since then,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.600
I lost all my family.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.480
I can never forget that day.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.970
I rushed into the hospital.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.960
Mother...

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.960
didn't have time to say the last word to me.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.880
She grabbed my hand

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.040
[She slipped from my face.]

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.860
At that moment,

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.120
I felt

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.680
I have nothing left.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960
From that day on,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.960
I sold all my assets.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.680
In Chang'an,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.360
in Chang'an.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.640
I want to give a home

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.360
a home.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.040
and peaceful.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.880
It's getting bigger.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.200
and better.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.840
But I

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.040
still feel homeless.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.720
Dad!

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.840
Yae.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.640
I haven't been back for a long time.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.040
Tang...

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.000
The world is peaceful.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.880
The people

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.040
live and work in peace.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.960
My child.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.760
Everything is fine.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.120
I just...

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.640
I just miss you.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.960
Why are your eyes red?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.200
I don't know why.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.960
Seeing you sad

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.520
I'm sad too.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.720
When I saw you cry,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.240
I want to cry too.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.440
By the way,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.680
Aren't you just a delinquent?

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200
How could you make such a scene?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.440
You set fire and shot arrows.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.680
Are you hiding something from me?

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.880
After today,

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.920
my identity will be exposed.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.160
I'll tell you then.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.760
Who are you?

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.480
Tell you or not?

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.290
You just said you don't need to hide it.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.000
Let me think about it.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.900
How about this?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.920
Tell me who you are.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.440
I'll also tell you who I am.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.840
Who else can you be?

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.960
I have a great identity.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.480
I'm definitely better than you.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680
Let's do it. Okay.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.760
Fine.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.360
Elder Wen, I didn't do my job well.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.440
Xu Ziqi and Hua Xiaochi escaped.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.880
Where did they go?

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.610
They escaped into the mountain and disappeared.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.880
Useless!

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
Xu Ziqi...

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.360
is not dead.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.560
You call him brother with a different surname.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.760
You didn't know he was alive?

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.760
I don't know.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.240
Xu Ziqi is an imperial spy.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.200
Under His Majesty's order, he wants to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.000
Do you know

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.100
Xu Ziqi has been in contact with the room so frequently.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.760
I'm afraid you can't get rid of it.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:01.960
I...

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.160
If Lord Wu hadn't been prepared,

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.920
you would have flipped us all.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.200
Master Yi.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.340
You kicked us out of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280
Surprised?

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.680
The biggest traitor

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.480
was brought up by you.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.680
No.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.640
I had no idea he was a spy.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.920
I had no idea.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.400
You never suspected me.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.000
I...

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.000
I never doubted it.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I swear to God

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.880
I have never

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.880
towards the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.200
Never.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.540
Release hatred

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.000
You have no evidence now.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.520
I can't do anything about it.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.400
Leave. I can't protect you.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.200
Master Yi.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.800
My family is still exiled at the border.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.360
Master Yi.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.160
Get out of here! Get out of here!

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.960
Leave.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.000
All of you

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.200
you asked me to do.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.280
For the past three years,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.360
for the past three years.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.720
Now,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.840
wants to kick me out of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.730
It's really a waste of time.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.640
The good bow is hidden. The cunning rabbit is dead.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.760
Dog boiling.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.960
You don't have to trouble everyone.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.120
I...

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.040
I'll go by myself.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.440
You kicked him out too.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.460
What else do you want to do?

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.760
Get rid of him.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.880
Find the assassins.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.250
I'll offer 1,000 taels of gold.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.640
to reward Xu Ziqi.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.920
of Xu Ziqi.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.280
The assassins might not succeed.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.960
Spread the news

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.360
is a spy in the palace,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.680
his enemies will kill him.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.960
With the help of our ancestors,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.960
the Imperial Agent.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.840
Can you see His Majesty every day?

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.120
and go to the palace anytime?

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.400
So handsome.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.480
Still not as handsome as you.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.120
Even your ancestors came out to help you change your fate.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.200
but I think you're talking nonsense.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.440
Wait.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.200
You said your ancestors

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.730
and guide your future fate.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.530
Then you'll be controlled by what he said.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.720
Indeed.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.200
My mother and dad

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.200
owed a lot of money.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.600
That's why he sold me to Zhang Gui-cai.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.600
That's why I ran away from marriage and killed myself.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.660
I don't want to go back.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.240
I want to stay here.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.240
Although all the experiences in Chang'an

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.280
is not as smooth as I thought,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.200
I learned a lot.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.760
and suffered a lot.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.520
But here,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.480
everyone works hard for life.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.400
This real feeling is simple.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:32.960
And

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.880
I'm happier

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.200
than before.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.600
Why?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.220
Because of you.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.360
Because of me.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920
Because of you.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.120
I saw someone else.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.280
except myself.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.920
I also saw someone else.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.720
I said these.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.060
Aren't you scared?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.240
I'm scared.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.840
My identity as an Imperial Agent

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.960
has been exposed.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.760
We were hunted down just now.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.890
Now you ask me if I'm scared.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.920
I suddenly feel

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.720
I came here

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.640
to meet you.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.000
Zheng and Xu Ziqi are in the same place now.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.880
And I

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.600
have always

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.400
from the beginning.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.440
Lord Xu's identity as a spy

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.400
to tell you.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.450
I can't tell you.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.170
Then why did Tong Hua Xiao Zheng say

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.460
when Xu Ziqi pretended to be dead,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.040
when Xu Ziqi pretended to be dead.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.850
They love each other every day.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.960
They say

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.120
gold is the hardest thing in the world.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.360
Never rotten.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.160
Yang Lin.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.240
Everyone in the mansion thinks I made this statue

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.920
to keep Hua Xiao Zheng with gold.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.680
Actually,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.520
I'm selfish.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960
I believe it.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.290
Love is stronger than gold.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.720
But I...

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.200
But these two...

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.040
the two closest to me

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.640
never cared about me.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.160
and never trusted me.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.900
I was distrusted by the Chamber of Commerce.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.640
Tell me,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.680
how can I let them go?

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.880
Never.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.040
You...

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.560
What's wrong, Xu Ziqi?

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.219
Keep quiet.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.659
There's someone else.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.370
Let's go.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.719
Brother Zhang.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.520
Second Master.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.639
Mr. Zhang.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.800
Get up.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.560
Brother Xu, are you okay?

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.800
We're fine.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.639
I was about to wash her hair.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.320
You guys go to the side

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.440
You can roast it after washing it.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.000
Okay.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.080
It's okay.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.920
Slow down.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.400
Okay.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.370
Let's go.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.720
All the dark forces are after you.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.280
The person behind it has rewarded 1,000 taels of gold.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.960
All assassins came out

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.280
just to get Brother Xu's head

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.960
for a lifetime of wealth.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.760
I brought you water and wine.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.840
Some food

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.480
and bedding.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.960
This is an emergency.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.320
I don't know how long you'll be hiding here.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.520
It's good to prepare more.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:28.880
Also,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.040
I've prepared a box of money for you.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.160
There are a few boxes in the back.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.360
These are some coins.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.880
You can spend them anytime.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.760
So many.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.100
Xu Ziqi's identity as a spy has been exposed.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.380
The enemy is after him.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.160
I don't know

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.160
how long you'll stay on this waterway.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160
I think

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.160
if you have a baby in the future,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.040
these milk bottles diapers open pants,

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.960
and cotton

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.080
and sewing for you.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.860
We've thought about it. Look at this.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.280
The 1,000 words that the child taught in the morning.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.210
The Three-Character Classic, University Analects

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.920
I've prepared everything for you.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.320
There are also things to practice calligraphy.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.250
There are weapons and instruments for martial arts.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.400
I also prepared some bowls and utensils.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.240
If you like cooking,

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.560
everything is ready.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.880
Look at you.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.080
It's too safe.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.440
We're being chased.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.520
It's not convenient for us to show up.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.760
So I borrowed Zhang's boat

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.320
for a while.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240
After some time,

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.520
let's see if there's a right time

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.370
and find a place to settle down.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.010
I just don't know

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.570
how long it will take to live like this.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.560
Do we have to

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.920
all our life?

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.490
Take it as a big boat tour around the world.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.280
I don't know when I can see you again.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.400
It's not easy to make it.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.040
Our family business

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.640
our own business.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.440
You...

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.000
You left us such a big mess.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.560
and just left.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.080
You two should run our shop well.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.120
This is our hard work.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.090
Don't worry.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.960
The moon

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.000
It's so round.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.160
So much food.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.840
Eat more. You didn't eat much yesterday.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.560
I'm afraid you'll be hungry.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.440
Okay.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:43.760
Come on

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.780
The boat will depart at midnight.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.500
Brother Zhang said

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.080
the sea has been windy these days.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.560
I'm afraid it'll be too bumpy for you.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.040
You can sleep better after drinking a glass of wine.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:00.440
Okay.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.120
Aren't you drinking?

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:04.640
I...

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.240
hurt my back.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880
I can't drink yet.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.640
I'll drink.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.120
It's not spicy at all.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.410
It's sour and sweet.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.880
This wine

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.600
is the wine I specially found for you.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.080
Only Persia has it.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.280
Next,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.360
Jin'er.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.960
Hero, Zhang Gui Cai,

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.920
Yang Debiao

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.960
and Yang Debiao's annoying father.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.960
is cute sometimes.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.980
Separating hatred

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.360
Husppy

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.280
Zheng.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.080
Will you regret going with me?

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.120
Are you stupid?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.600
They are important to me.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.760
But you are more important to me.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.120
Besides,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.040
I gave up my fame and fortune for you.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.760
I even risked my whole family

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.880
If I don't go with you,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.080
it would be a loss.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.320
But...

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.280
Is it really worth it?

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800
Do you really not regret

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.970
Do you really not regret it?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.080
I'm the only one in my family

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.280
besides my ancestors.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.040
and have no contributions

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.280
to society.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.860
Your family is different.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.320
Your family is loyal.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.160
Besides, compared to those uncertainties,

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.280
than those uncertainties.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.480
My original dream was

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.960
to have a big house on the water.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.340
When you open the door,

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.120
the endless sea.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.960
Look, it's great now.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.020
We live on the boat.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.320
When you go out,

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.370
it'll be the sea.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.890
Isn't it better?

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.520
Xu Ziqi.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.000
Is the boat set off?

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.320
It feels like

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.960
a little...

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.920
I feel a little dizzy.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.520
Zheng.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.240
I'm sorry.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.800
This wine...

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.280
in this wine.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.240
In two hours,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.080
Jin'er will come

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.850
I'll come and take you away.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.440
I wanted to write you a letter,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.940
but I was afraid

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.240
when you read this letter,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.240
when you see this letter.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.960
So except money,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.720
except money.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.120
Just pretend

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.920
know each other.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.000
I can't bear

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.720
to let you wander around with me.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.440
and live such a hard life.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.960
The more you say

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.120
to travel the world with me,

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.100
the more reluctant I am to let you do this.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.040
Maybe our Xu family

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.800
is destined to be alone.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.240
You can never be with the one you love.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.560
Zheng.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.360
Don't worry.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.120
No matter where I go,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.720
I will protect the people of that country

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.580
and fulfill my ancestral teachings.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.980
For the country and the people

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.850
for the country and the people.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.520
Why are you awake?

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.960
You didn't make me dizzy.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.810
Jin'er told me everything.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.840
You've been stabbed a thousand times.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.240
Trying to leave me again?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.520
Didn't you play dead last time?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.000
No.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.960
It's for your own good.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.820
I'm afraid you'll suffer with me.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.520
For my own good.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.440
I think you didn't beat me enough.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.120
You even drugged me.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.920
How do you know

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.440
How much is the right medicine?

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.600
I can't take care of myself if there are too many drugs.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.920
When you leave,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:21.640
I won't.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.340
I'm experienced. I won't make mistakes.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.020
You're still denying it, aren't you?

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.600
No.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.240
Zheng!

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.160
No!

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.920
That's...

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.520
is so cruel.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.720
This scream

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.880
It's like being chased by a wolf.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.960
When Lord Xu and Zhang Gui Cai

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.600
to check the water route.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.840
He was practicing the pot in the room.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.970
She only practiced hundreds of times.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.080
She said she had to be strong and steady.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.410
You need to hit someone to vent your anger.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.000
Wait, don't make a sound.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.290
Something's up.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.640
Something happened.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.040
Your butt was hit.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.760
No.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.800
Assassins are all carrying weapons.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.960
They are coming this way.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.960
Brother Xu.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.170
My brother just sent a message.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.480
we found a large team.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.330
It's too late to escape.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.560
They're too fast!

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.600
I'll set off now.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.160
There might be a chance of survival.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:26.760
Wait.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.880
There was a slight collision in the sound.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.520
They brought bows and arrows.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.720
Even if we set off now,

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.960
it should be too late.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.720
I'll ask all my brothers

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800
to gather.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.640
Can you swim?

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.280
What are you doing?

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.240
Now the enemy is coming.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.760
Jump into the water first.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.490
That way, you won't get caught.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.720
Diving.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.440
Jin'er.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.440
I'm afraid if I die today,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.370
I won't have the chance to say I love you again.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.560
I love you so many times.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.360
We'll die together.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.840
Let's live together.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.760
Xiao Zheng, jump!

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.240
They are not sober.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.520
You're not sober with them.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.880
What did you say?

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.680
At least he can swing the pot.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.700
What can you do?

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.880
You'll only be a burden if you stay.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.160
What do you mean?

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.890
I think we should die early.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.920
Brother Zhang and I are usually in the martial world.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.120
We've been living on the edge of a knife.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.120
Yes.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.640
We've decided to fight.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.840
hoping you can live well.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.040
Now that the army is approaching the city,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.640
I'm ready to die.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.040
I won't hesitate

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440
no matter what.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.080
Zheng.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.840
This time,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.810
We're really going to be apart.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.600
Xu Ziqi.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.640
Come on.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.440
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.280
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.
