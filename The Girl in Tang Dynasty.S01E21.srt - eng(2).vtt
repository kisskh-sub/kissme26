WEBVTT

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.880
Five.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.160
Three.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.600
Two.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.640
That

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.360
bad person

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.000
is so polite.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.160
Who's there?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.640
Boss,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
it's me,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.639
Tu Da.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.960
Brother.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.800
Brother, are you alright?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.079
You guys,

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:17.810
are you okay?

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.400
You scared me to death!

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.960
You were going to push me into the water, weren't you?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.640
And fighting against the whole world.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.360
Why don't you say you'll sacrifice your heart for the Tang Dynasty?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.960
Sir Xu, we were ordered to protect your safety.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.520
But your bottom

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.540
is almost beaten to a pulp.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.660
I won't disturb you two brothers.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.440
We'd better stay out of this.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.680
Well...

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.400
We're all brothers here.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.360
Who would care about such things?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.400
Besides,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.320
the only one who can beat our boss

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.800
is Miss Xiaofei.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.760
No one else is allowed.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.240
Stop!

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.640
You...

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.400
Xiaofei...

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.560
Her Majesty has sent orders.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.760
We must receive them.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.900
Her Majesty commands:

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.560
Master Xu's identity has been exposed.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.360
Enemies will surely come seeking revenge.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Until the master's safety is secured,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
we must protect him at all times.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.520
The master is a pillar of the state.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
We cannot allow him to suffer

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.680
even the slightest harm.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.960
Right.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.760
Her Majesty only ordered us to defend against outside threats.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.640
As for domestic violence,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.240
we

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.210
will not interfere.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.360
With so many skilled people protecting me,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.200
my safety

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.140
shouldn't be an issue, right?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.480
Her Majesty has sent

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.980
half of her strongest fighters here at once.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.890
Your safety should be guaranteed now.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.640
Now you need to swear

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.240
in front of everyone

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.220
that you'll never leave me again.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.760
I...

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.480
Never mind. I won't curse you.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.640
Xiaofei.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.800
From now on,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.640
I absolutely

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.890
will never leave you again.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.680
Stop staring.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.760
Jinjin.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.000
Jin'er.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.880
C-come out.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.880
I need to talk to you.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.880
I'm here.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.200
Jin'er, I...

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.880
I...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.440
I need to talk to you.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.560
Of course.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
It's a long story,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.320
but we can keep it brief.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.360
I...

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.200
I can't...

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.680
Stop.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.760
Are you...

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.320
going to propose?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.440
Why are you so passionate

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.320
when confessing your love to me,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.680
but so hesitant about proposing?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.000
Jin'er.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.200
Before,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.460
no matter how many times I told you I love you,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.760
I knew

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.640
you wouldn't respond to me.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.440
So

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.080
I could say it boldly with a smile,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.140
without worrying about the outcome.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880
But now,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.200
I can feel

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.640
you have feelings for me,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.680
with hope and trust.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.740
So I don't want to let you down.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.560
Jin'er, you

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.520
are the best woman in the world.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.520
I'm afraid I can't be

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.120
a man you can rely on.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.340
What are you really afraid of?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.920
I'm afraid of so many things.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.120
I'm afraid I can't spend my life with you.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.760
I'm afraid our feelings might change.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.159
I'm afraid I can't protect you completely.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.010
The more I think, the more scared I get.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.890
Before coming here,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.740
I spent the whole day fishing.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.640
I thought the river god's blessing

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.380
would give me courage.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.080
But I've noticed

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.560
Do you think Miss Jiner will accept?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.020
It doesn't matter anyway.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.200
Hard to say.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.760
When other men propose,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.800
they can't wait to make grand promises.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.960
I think she'll accept.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.760
They certainly try to trick

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.360
the girl into nodding with tears of gratitude.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.960
But when you propose,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.760
you insist on telling all the frightening things.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.440
Jiner,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.680
if I can marry you,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.800
it's not a momentary impulse but a lifelong commitment.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.440
I dare not be careless.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.320
Are you willing?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.960
You don't want to.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.800
I'm just amazed

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.440
that the man I've fallen in love with

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.200
is so forthright and honest.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.440
Jiner, did you say

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.720
you love me?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.440
Zhang Guicai,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.200
I've never met a man like you.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.200
You're kind and righteous,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.200
willing to go through fire and water for love,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.260
never expecting anything in return.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.800
In my life as Gu Jiner,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800
I've seen so many men,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.680
but only you truly accept me,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.040
protect me,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.040
come close to me and warm me.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.080
So,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.480
now

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.800
I want to ask you,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.920
may I

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.080
be your wife?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.960
I do want you, Gu Jiner,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.920
to be my only wife,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560
in this life,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.080
in every life,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.560
for all eternity.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.840
As for those unknowns you mentioned,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.600
the fears,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.260
it doesn't matter.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.020
We'll face them together.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680
Gu Jin'er,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.160
will you marry me?

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.080
Wait.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.300
Instructor Xue is coming.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.400
You need to

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.480
stand up.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.280
Zhang Guicai.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.960
These

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.800
are the dowry I've prepared for Jin'er.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.680
Don't think she's all alone

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.880
and you can bully her.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.200
This is her family home.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.440
I

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.400
am her family.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.410
You came to me when you were six.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440
I never thought of

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.800
raising you as a cash cow.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.800
My greatest wish

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.160
is for you to marry a good man.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.200
So many men come and go.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.960
Only Zhang Guicai

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.720
would make me feel at ease giving you to him.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.500
For these 14 years,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.880
I haven't spent a penny of what you earned here.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.100
I've been waiting for this day

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.200
when you'd find a reliable man

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.560
and take it all with you as your dowry.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.960
Teacher.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.330
Everything I say

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.050
is for your own good.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.960
I'm strict with you

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.040
because I fear you might choose the wrong husband.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.440
I don't want you getting close to Young Master Fang

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.560
because he simply

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.960
isn't worthy of your lifelong commitment.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.840
But now I can rest easy.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.440
Zhang Guicai.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.480
I'm entrusting my most precious treasure.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.620
I'm leaving her in your hands.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.560
Please take good care of her, will you?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.440
Don't worry.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.810
I'll definitely take good care of Jin'er.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.200
These are all things I wanted to do for you.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.210
All these years,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.160
you've earned so much face for me.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.560
This is what you deserve.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.860
Don't feel like you don't deserve it.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.650
Take these with you to start your new life.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.360
You'll have confidence.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.800
Between us,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.930
there's no such thing as who owes whom.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440
What are you standing there for?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.560
Help your wife!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.960
Jin'er.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.890
You don't need to kneel before me anymore.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.600
You're a free person now.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.160
I'm no longer your instructor Xue.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.960
Alright.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.010
On such a wonderful day,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320
no more crying.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.290
Your makeup will run and ruin your beauty.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.680
It's so beautiful.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.240
I promise you,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.480
once you're safe,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.930
I'll propose to you even more formally than this.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.800
Look! Look!

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.560
This is truly a feeling of loneliness.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.560
This...

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.600
Master Xu,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.200
we've been ordered to protect your safety.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.800
We fear your enemies might seek revenge.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.560
Today we've discussed many things with our Buliangren brothers.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.360
First, we need to clarify who all your enemies are.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.560
The palace has provided a file memo.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.680
Tonight, we request that you join us

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.720
to mark the locations of your enemies on the map,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.320
and draft another list of potential assailants.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.650
Better safe than sorry.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.920
What's wrong?

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.720
I have quite a few enemies.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.440
How many? A lot?

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.320
Five? Ten?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.840
Jiading.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.160
Have the camp bring the Wuxu Cabinet files.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.800
Yes, sir.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.680
Go.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.080
So many!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.120
There's more?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.240
Can't help it.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.920
I'm too good at what I do.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.480
Categorize

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.210
and mark quickly on the map.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.560
Let's do it.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.320
Mr. Xu,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.440
you're impressive!

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.440
Taking down all of Chang'an.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.440
I think

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.320
there's no need to organize this at all.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.040
Boss, do you remember?

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200
For example, this is Chang'an City,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.130
and this around Chang'an is called

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.080
Fusang.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.840
You've already taken down half of Fusang.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.680
That country

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.540
isn't very big anyway.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.160
Sir, things have come to this point.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.599
Danger is everywhere,

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.760
threats in everything.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.440
It seems we must stay close

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.700
to protect you, Mr. Xu.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.280
We can't have them following us forever

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.339
and protecting us.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.880
No matter how closely they follow,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.960
they'll get drowsy,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.619
need the bathroom, or get headaches sometimes.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.819
What else can we do?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.120
The people in Chang'an who know you, Xu Ziqi, are a good official

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.880
need to increase in number.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.720
Mr. Xu is surrounded by enemies and targeted by villains.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.360
We scholars

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.360
can only do three things for him.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.480
First, write a biography for Mr. Xu.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.880
'The Biography of Xu Ziqi, Descendant of the Loyal and Good.'

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.120
Let those hiding in Chang'an,

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.200
those villains who want to harm Mr. Xu,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.660
know of Mr. Xu's goodness.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.200
Make them abandon their assassination plans.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.440
Good.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.960
Kill Xu Ziqi

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.040
to avenge my father.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.480
Kill Xu Ziqi

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.760
to avenge my father.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.240
No, you can't kill him!

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.560
You mustn't kill him!

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.760
Mr. Xu is a good man!

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.840
It was our father who was the Tuyuhun spy,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.760
who betrayed the Great Tang.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.360
We can't fail to distinguish right from wrong.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.280
What did you say?

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.610
Take a look at this book.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.960
We should be descendants of the loyal and good.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.720
We need to become Buliang warriors

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.680
like Lord Xu

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.480
and dedicate our hearts to protect the Tang Dynasty.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.960
We need to become Buliang warriors.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.160
Second point.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.280
All weapons from nearby blacksmiths

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.520
will be discounted these days

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.960
so every citizen can afford

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960
suitable weapons

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.820
to join the battle at any time.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.440
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.920
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.440
Third,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.280
if anyone attempts to assassinate Master Xu in our presence,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.400
we shall risk our lives

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.060
to ensure Master Xu's safety.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.850
Master Xu Ziqi's family has been loyal for generations,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.000
sacrificing three generations for our great Tang Dynasty.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.600
We must not let Master Xu die in vain.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.440
We can't die in vain.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.880
Protect Master Xu!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.880
Protect Master Xu!

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.240
Cucumbers!

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.640
-Come and see!
-Look!

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.680
Fresh cucumbers!

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.600
Cucumbers!

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.680
Assassin!

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.240
There's an assassin!

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.680
Let's have stir-fried cucumbers tonight.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.480
Run!

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.760
Let's see how far you can run.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.240
Why did you stop running?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.100
Who goes there?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.130
State your name.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.280
Bastard!

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.610
What gibberish is he speaking?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.920
Get down!

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.640
Assassin!

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.160
Catch him!

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.360
There's an assassin!

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.480
Mr. Xu.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.600
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Xu.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.160
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.040
Not at all.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.440
Not at all.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.720
Your Majesty, regarding Mr. Xu's matter,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.520
I didn't have to deploy a single soldier.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.960
The citizens of Chang'an rose up on their own

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.160
and caught all the assassins in one sweep.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.120
It seems good deeds are still rewarded in this world.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.800
The people rising to protect a loyal official -

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.280
this is what I

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.120
have always hoped to see in a prosperous era.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.920
These citizens,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.440
they distinguish right from wrong, loyal from treacherous,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.840
and are willing to risk their lives to protect the virtuous.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.240
Our Princess Taiping

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.360
will surely live in an era of peace and prosperity.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.160
Your Majesty is right. Look.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.280
Kill!

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.650
Look at this.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.090
This ball is decent.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.280
This one...

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.360
This won't work.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.680
Let me change it.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.880
It's quite light.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.440
How's everything going?

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.040
Chief, for fifteen consecutive days,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.400
Chang'an has captured

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.960
1,649 assassins in total.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.200
After interrogating each one,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.720
Chief,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.520
we've basically cleared out all your enemies.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.120
What's your next plan?

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:17.840
Tu Da,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120
move there.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.640
Everything's done.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.480
Those civilians,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.680
they're even more enthusiastic about catching assassins than we are.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.740
They catch nearly a hundred each day.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.280
The prison is almost full.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680
That's good.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.620
You don't have to hang around me all day anymore.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.200
You can go do things you want to do.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.000
Being stuck in one place is boring.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.880
Mr. Xu,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.840
we enjoy following Miss Xiaofei.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.280
Besides, she has taught us a lot.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.940
You don't understand.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.780
I'm already being so tactful.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.840
You really think you're being productive?

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.640
All day wasting time with trivial pursuits.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.440
Not behaving like Jinwu Guards at all.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.640
Go back and practice your martial arts.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.640
Come on,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.570
everyone gather up!

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
Really...

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.120
Brothers,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.650
General Qin,

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.180
before departing,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.060
I have something important to do.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.660
The other enemies were not my personal foes.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.400
But the one who burned down my house

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.060
I must capture him myself.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:32.770
Alright.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.120
Xiaofei, I'll be right back.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.160
Be careful.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.600
Let's go.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.400
Move.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.840
Isn't this a victory?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.940
I really don't understand

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.800
what your men were thinking.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.680
Every sword used to assassinate me

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.140
has 'Xing' engraved on it,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.820
and they even kept receipts in duplicate from the blacksmith.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.360
So what if it was me?

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.280
I'll make you pay for this.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.170
All for Hua Xiaofei,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.960
that slut.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.520
You filthy scum.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640
Take him to prison

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.900
to await judgment from the Ministry of Justice.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.560
I don't have enough evidence

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.880
to prove that you three were also involved.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.880
We certainly weren't, Magistrate Xu.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.200
When we heard about your incident,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.530
our hearts were broken.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.530
You are our local official,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.000
how could we possibly harm you?

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.200
Exactly.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.440
You've brought so many people here.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.600
Kill us if you want.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.840
It's up to you.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.160
I've already told you

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.960
I have no evidence to arrest you.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.640
You can still remain in the chamber of commerce.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.480
I can prove it.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.440
The other three elders are also involved in this matter.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.900
They can all be thrown into prison together.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.360
Master Xu, it's been a while.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.960
Fang Lihen.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.440
I've always treated you well.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.410
Why are you turning against me?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.280
Ali.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.620
Are you going to expose the chamber's wrongdoings?

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.540
I will testify.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.440
The assassination attempt against Master Xu

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.440
was a conspiracy by the Four Elders.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.640
Arrest them!

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.120
The Four Elders

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.960
had long found Master Xu irritating

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.780
and felt they could never gain his trust.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.640
They feared he would make accusations based on rumors

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.840
and disrupt the guild's normal operations.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.170
Furthermore, Master Xu

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.920
had multiple previous conflicts with the guild,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.120
planting the seeds of discord long ago.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.480
Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce has decided

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.940
to assassinate Master Xu.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.120
I knew it.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.720
All these years, you've been nothing but an ungrateful wolf.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.000
I never thought that you, this little lamb,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.600
would be capable of such a thing.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.160
The descendant of a criminal official

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.360
is nothing but trash.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.480
This will destroy our Chamber of Commerce.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.360
What benefit does this bring you?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.520
What benefit?

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.040
You simply want to take my place.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880
Am I right?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.770
The witness is here.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.120
I hope you will uphold justice, Mr. Xu

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.530
and throw all four elders into prison.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.360
I, Fang Lihen, will testify about the crimes of the four elders

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.820
and tell everything I know

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.760
without holding anything back.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.440
Mr. Xu.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.240
They were trying to kill you.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.040
How can you show mercy

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.720
to those who wanted you dead?

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.280
I cannot wrongfully accuse any innocent person

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.810
nor can I kill the innocent.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.300
If every official in the Tang Dynasty

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.440
ruled based on personal preferences

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.440
and personal grudges,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.970
then the country would fall apart.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.880
Take Elder Xing to prison

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.000
to await the Ministry of Justice's verdict.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.660
As for the other three elders,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.200
take them to the magistrate's office first,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.660
and after interrogation,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.120
we will decide their fate.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.920
Yes.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.060
Take them away.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.640
Fang Lihen,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.480
remember.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.080
Li.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.640
Now that the four elders have lost their power,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.480
you might as well surrender.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.520
Tell us everything the guild has done

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520
over these years.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.600
This way,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160
you might have a chance to redeem yourself.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.120
I will petition the court to protect you

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.520
and bring your parents back to Chang'an soon.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.640
When I heard you died from poisoning,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.440
I felt

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.240
extremely sad.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.160
In Chang'an,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.920
you were my only brother.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920
I thought,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.530
if you were really gone,

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.640
I would truly be

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.760
all alone.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.860
But unexpectedly,

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.440
you faked your death.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.760
And I knew nothing about it from beginning to end.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.040
Because of my identity as an imperial detective,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.570
I couldn't tell anyone about faking my death.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.290
You investigated the guild as a secret agent.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.930
While investigating the guild by my side,

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.690
did you truly see me as a brother

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.360
or were you just using me?

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.290
If you were using me,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.600
you certainly treated me very well.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.200
But if you considered me a brother,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.260
why did you never consider things from my perspective?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.400
Xu Ziqi,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.880
I can no longer trust you.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.420
Now that all four elders have been captured,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.480
you've gotten what you wanted.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.600
From now on,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.800
the guild's affairs,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.440
my affairs,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.200
stay out of all of it.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.000
Ali! Ali!

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.200
Sir,

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.170
must you really do this?

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.960
Right now,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.000
I can only pledge my allegiance to Master Wu.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.260
Master Wu loves money.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.160
If I don't offer him some wealth,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.240
how will he know I'm obedient enough?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.080
That I'm capable enough?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.050
How would he let me replace the four elders

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.880
and truly control the guild?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.040
But, but this is too much, sir!

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.120
Sir,

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.440
how can you put all your chips

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.440
on this Master Wu?

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.680
You two have never even met!

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.960
Master Wu's usual methods,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.880
as you've heard,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.930
he's not exactly a good person.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.000
Yang Lin.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.040
Do you remember

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.060
what this mansion used to be like?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.130
In the mornings,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.720
Father

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.080
would recite books with me in the corridor.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.200
Mother would bring us soup she made herself.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.360
At meals, the family would sit together

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.000
and chat about everyday things.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.200
I don't want to...

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.200
I really don't want to be alone

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.240
living in this empty house anymore.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.850
No matter how many possessions I have,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.680
they're still cold.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.140
What does it matter if Master Wu isn't a good person?

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.680
As long as he's capable.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.440
But sir,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.240
this is Miss Xiaofei's golden statue!

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.020
When the heart is gone,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.330
keeping these things is meaningless.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.640
Consider it

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.120
my farewell to Xiaofei.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.640
Take it out and melt it down.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.840
Xu Ziqi.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.960
Look.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.680
That's a tree.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.290
That's a flower.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.920
Look at those clouds.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.680
And that bird.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.240
Xiaofei.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.440
Even though I used to see them every day,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.560
now that I've been given a second chance,

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.220
everything looks different.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.940
The trees are so green.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.010
The clouds are so white.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.690
The flowers are so vibrant.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.930
And the birds are so beautiful.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.840
Xiaofei,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.860
you're beautiful too.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.280
When I think about

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.920
our nice house

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.440
burning down after less than 20 days,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.730
it makes me so angry.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.040
It's okay.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.440
Manager Xing paid us good compensation.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.280
As long as we still have the land,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.960
rebuilding will be fine.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.400
We can even improve the layout.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.800
Right.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.290
The previous layout

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.200
had a living room that was too big and bedrooms too small.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.600
The kitchen was too small too.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.660
It affects your...

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.120
Wait,

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.330
isn't this our previous house?

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.800
How is it still here after the fire?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.250
Let's go.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.680
Mr. Xu.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.600
Mr. Xu.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.720
Mr. Xu.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.600
Mr. Xu.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.440
Mr. Xu loves his country and its people.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.600
How could we let such a good official

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.800
not even have a place to live?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.200
Today.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.680
Indeed.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.600
We found the original blueprints of the house.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.840
Working day and night,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.970
everyone pitched in

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.360
to rebuild this house for you.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.000
It's identical inside and out,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.200
down to the smallest detail.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.760
Yes. Madam, would you like

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.440
to take a look inside?

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.720
Let's go.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.120
Not too bad.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.500
It's exactly the same.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.360
Thank you all for your help, neighbors.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.719
After we get settled,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.600
I'll personally visit each of you to express my gratitude.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.960
Then we'll be expecting Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.880
to come over for a drink.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.239
We won't disturb you two any longer.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:28.100
We're leaving.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.489
Let's go.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.489
Let's go.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.719
Mrs. Xu?

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.600
We're not married yet.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.320
Stay calm.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.400
Not married?

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.900
What did you have in mind then?

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.300
What are you doing?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.080
Xiaofei,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.320
what's wrong?

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.440
I'm thinking about what to do next.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.570
Now that things have settled down,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.960
I plan to focus on my career again.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.400
I want to get rich.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.760
It might be difficult

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.500
with just my little treasure.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.500
But I can't give up.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.560
So,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.960
I'll try my best

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.820
to remain a female tycoon.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.880
What about you? What are your plans?

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.930
First, we need to set up our home properly.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.920
I'm thinking of getting a bigger bed.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.920
That way when we sleep together,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.120
we won't easily roll off.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.240
Then,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.320
we need a large dining table,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.290
an extremely large one.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.100
And most importantly,

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.240
although my identity as an imperial detective

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.360
has been exposed,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.080
I still need to continue investigating the chamber of commerce matter.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.340
While the four elders are under control,

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.480
I plan to interrogate them thoroughly

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.000
to find out where the account book is hidden.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.280
It's just one account book,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.000
how can it be so impossible to find?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.400
Maybe it's not an ordinary account book.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960
That makes sense.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.490
For example?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.840
Well,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.160
it could be

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.800
an emotionless learning machine,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.260
memorizing the accounts.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.090
Actually just a living person.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.520
That seems quite far-fetched.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.080
Or

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.480
maybe it's hidden in a secret cellar

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.320
guarded by monsters,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.440
perhaps a three-headed dog

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.840
or a giant spider.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.040
Or maybe there's a snake

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.220
that turns you to stone with one look.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.040
Xiaofei,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.640
you should focus on making money.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.280
Leave the investigation to me.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.960
Alright!

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.000
Sir, the person has arrived.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.420
Why don't you remove the blindfold covering your eyes?

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.320
What you wish for me to see,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.520
I will surely see.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.760
What you don't wish for me to see,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.160
I wouldn't dare look at all.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.440
Take it off.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.440
The items you presented,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.180
I've seen them,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.480
I like them very much,

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480
and I accept them.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.800
If you

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.880
have any requests of me,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.280
feel free to speak.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.280
I beg you to grant me real authority in the guild,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.120
to give me a chance

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.000
to make something of myself.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.880
Living without seeking comfort and peace,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.620
insisting on making achievements instead.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.960
You young people,

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.400
do you truly understand what it means that 'the wise adapt to circumstances'?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.760
Being born in prosperous times -

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.120
these are the circumstances.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.360
Not fighting, not grabbing,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.960
not competing,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.160
knowing your place - that's being wise.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.040
What achievements do you seek?

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.800
To cause trouble for the court?

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.640
If you want achievements,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.640
comfort and peace are certainly not what you seek.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.480
Speak. What do you really want?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.890
I am the son of the disgraced official Fang Siyou.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.360
I want to find a patron

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.440
to clear me of the stigma of being a criminal's son.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.960
You young people

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.960
still don't see through the ways of this world.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.920
A stain is something that can never be truly cleaned.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.520
When the stain is gone,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.980
the fabric is also ruined.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.760
It ruins both the appearance

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.920
and the substance.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.080
Sir, I have nowhere else to turn.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.440
Sir.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.640
You are this humble one's last hope.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.000
You're

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.560
quite obedient indeed.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.360
You've given me such a nice gift,

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.060
I should return the favor.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.000
Come on, bring it in.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.960
Boss.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.880
Didn't we agree to conduct an interrogation?

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880
What's all this?

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.610
It looks like an ambush.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.240
We're doing serious work here.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.400
We finally caught these four elders.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.640
Of course we need to interrogate them

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.560
thoroughly and completely.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.120
So...

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.840
We brought our own supplies.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.440
Boss, boss.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.730
Something terrible has happened!

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.640
Open it!

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.360
Sir,

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600
I've been disrespectful.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.560
Please punish me,

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.320
sir.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.400
These elders of the guild

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.240
have little loyalty,

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.960
yet plenty of schemes.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.760
They're so disobedient

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.970
and reckless in their actions.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.810
Keeping them around will only cause trouble.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.140
Take them away.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.480
I've had someone remove those items.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.840
You can open your eyes now.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.760
Sir, may I ask where Elder Yi is now?

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.640
Elder Yi has confessed to the corruption charges

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.050
and will be executed tomorrow at noon.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.520
Elder Yi has been good to you,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.880
I am aware of that.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.760
Go see her one last time.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.360
Reminisce and share your thoughts,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.120
and also resolve some

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.800
unfinished matters.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.690
Unfinished matters...

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.760
It's getting late today.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.800
You should head home now.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.780
I understand, sir.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.450
I will take my leave now.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.320
I'll go now.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.000
You may go.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.160
Sir, do you think

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.520
that Fang Lihen is someone we can use?

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.240
He seems naive and easy to control.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.880
But people,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.170
who doesn't have their own agenda?

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.720
Go and watch carefully

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.000
what he said

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.640
to Yi Rusu in the prison.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.040
This Yi Rusu,

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.520
is she hiding something from me?

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.000
Yes.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.640
Go see her one last time.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.120
She's dying.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.440
Do you still want to keep secrets in this world?

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.360
Elder Yi.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.800
These are all prepared for you by Xiaofei.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.920
She said in this prison,

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.600
toiletries are in short supply.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.000
Since you're

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.420
always so meticulous,

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.850
she prepared these things for you.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.320
They're not expensive items though.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.690
Please bear with it.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.280
Last night,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.660
the three of them never returned.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.160
I knew

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.160
they wouldn't come back.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.440
Elder Yi.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.700
There's something important

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.160
I must ask you.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.920
Is there a book in the guild that...

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.170
Why are you here?

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.650
I've come to visit Elder Yi.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.420
Is that necessary?

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.600
Master Xu, could you give us some privacy?

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.440
I have something

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.960
to say to Fang Lihen.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.000
Elder Yi.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.280
I know you want to replace me

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.040
and that's why you framed me.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.890
But I never thought Mr. Wu would be so ruthless

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.560
that he would take all four of our lives.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.560
Is there any way to get you out of here?

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.080
It's too late. I have no choice.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.290
I'm going to die anyway.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.120
Elder Yi.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:46.880
I...

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.760
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:49.880
Fang Lihen.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.980
You've been oppressed by the guild for so many years

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.760
and suffered so much.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.450
The guild is indeed falling apart now.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.040
You made a choice to protect yourself.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.600
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.480
Besides,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.800
what the four of us did was truly heinous.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.640
Since joining the guild,

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.120
I've always known I might die a gruesome death.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.780
I've thought about it before.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.610
What's with all this

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.440
commotion?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.520
Noon approaches.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.120
The prisoner Yi Rusu will be escorted to the execution ground.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:24.960
Today...

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400
Mr. Wu.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.240
He must have someone watching your every move,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.320
to see if

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.760
you can still help him gather some information.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.160
Shouldn't they at least give the person time to clean up?

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.220
It'll only take about half an incense stick. Just wait.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.640
The chamber of commerce has a ledger.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.840
I've hidden it inside the courtesan's portrait.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.440
Find the courtesan's portrait.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.760
This item must never be given to Master Wu.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.360
This man is heartless

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.520
and completely untrustworthy.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.440
You must find the ledger and keep it to protect yourself.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.200
Do you understand?
