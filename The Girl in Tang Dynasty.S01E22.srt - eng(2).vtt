00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.210
Be careful. Be careful.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.000
Understand?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.700
Everyone says Lord Xu is the king of hell.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.450
I didn't expect the king of hell to look like this.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160
Not everyone is like this.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.880
Although Master Yi

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639
I dare not agree with

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.480
I dare not agree with you.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.500
But you are straightforward.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.200
I'll be frank with you. I'll be frank with you. I'll be honest with you.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200
[Besides, I've never done this before.] [I've never done this before.]

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.329
All these years,

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.320
you've taken good care of Li.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.240
I should get you a basin of water.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.240
Everyone says Lord Xu is a good official.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.800
Indeed.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.040
I'm dressed like a vegetarian.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.079
No matter what,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040
step by step

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.840
step by step.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.360
I became the leader of this magnificent chamber.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.360
I told myself

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.680
never let anyone

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.840
again.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.120
I'm down

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.240
and helpless.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.400
Elder Yi.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.360
Elder Yi. Master Yi.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.560
Doctor! Call the doctor!

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.920
It's useless. She cut off her aorta.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.640
Time is running out.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.960
Separate hatred.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.160
I have something to tell you.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.480
I have to tell you.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.480
before I leave.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.570
Prepare the best coffin

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800
prepare the best coffin

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.520
and bury her well.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.480
Yes.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.640
Go.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.080
For your family and family,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920
for your family and family.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.320
Because I think

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.960
we are the same kind of people.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.079
From now on,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.519
I'll be your master. I'll be your master. I'll be your servant. I'll be your servant. I'll be your servant.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.720
If you follow Lord Wu,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.580
It's much harder than now.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.880
than now.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.880
As long as you think

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.490
if it's worth it.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.240
don't look back.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.120
The last thing I can do for you

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.520
is my death.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680
Just say

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320
when I committed suicide,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.680
I found nothing.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760
Lord Wu,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.680
Let's go. Let's go.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.780
Your Highness. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.920
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.120
I...

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.240
I can't...

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.800
kiss you.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.680
see you

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.800
Come on. Come on.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
reunite

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.320
together.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.880
Master Yi.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.320
Master Yi.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.680
It's fate.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.520
Li.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.370
My lord, Xu Ziqi.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.420
Xiao Zheng.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.320
Sir.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.240
Why is it all blood?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.120
Elder Yi committed suicide.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.080
and died in Ah Li's arms.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.880
Why did Master Yi commit suicide suddenly?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.120
It's good that he committed suicide.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.920
At least it's more decent to die.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120
with a full body.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I've sent someone

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.880
to bury her well.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.080
Let's go home now.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.320
I boiled hot water before going out.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.680
Go back and take a hot bath.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.880
Yang Lin.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.140
Take care of your lord.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.080
Wipe the rain for your lord.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.880
Where's the sedan chair?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.680
The blood stains are all over my body.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.240
I can't walk on the street.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.560
Husppy is carrying a sedan at the back.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.820
He should be here soon.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.500
Separating hatred

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.760
Xiao Zheng.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.120
Separate hatred. Take care.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.560
Go home now.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200
Let's go home too.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.240
Sir, the rain is getting heavier.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.850
The sedan chair is here.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.120
Let's go back.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.960
Why?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.680
Why did everyone leave me?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.120
Why?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.560
My lord.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.960
What's wrong?

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.000
My lord.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.299
Lord Fang, you're finally awake.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:39.840
It has been burnt for a whole day.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.919
I was so worried.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080
Are you okay?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.600
Get out.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.320
No, sir.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.080
You just woke up. You need someone to take care of you.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.800
Get out.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.400
This...

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.320
Yes.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.320
The Chamber of Commerce has a ledger.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.480
Don't give it to Lord Wu.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.280
This man is heartless and not trustworthy.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.560
You must find the ledger and protect yourself.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.860
Do you understand?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.800
Why am I still

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.960
I still want you so much?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.180
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.320
I don't want to

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.280
I don't want to lose you.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.680
Everyone is using me.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.380
Xu Ziqi used me to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.200
The four elders used me to work for them.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.280
Others used me

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.320
for their money.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.480
Except you,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.200
except you

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.040
only you

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.280
really loved me.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.800
Only you.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.140
I will never...

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.440
I will never let you go.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.160
I'll make sure you come back to me.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.840
I will.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.600
I will make you come back to me.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.960
I will.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.080
My lord, are you okay?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.480
My lord, don't scare me.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.040
My lord.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.440
Are you okay?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.920
Rest early today.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.680
I have something important to do tomorrow.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.480
What is it?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.080
Greetings, Lord Wu.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.080
I’m incompetent.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.400
I heard nothing.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.080
Master Ii, how dare you say that in front of me?

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.960
Master Yi...

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.720
I know everything.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.800
It’s not your fault.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.560
Master Yi has a temper.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080
This way

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.840
is something she can do.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.200
I failed.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.060
The first thing you asked me to do.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.160
Today, I came to ask for your forgiveness.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.560
I have no face to see you anymore.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.680
From now on,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.140
say goodbye to you.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.920
My lord.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.040
I think

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.320
Looks like he really apologized to you and left.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.200
He left firmly.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.640
Ask someone to call him back.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.960
He's a good boy.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.960
You have to train him well.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.440
Yes.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.200
We'll continue with the product.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.800
The main business content is still cosmetics.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.480
We still have no store for delivery.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.960
But now we need to solve two problems.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.600
First, our sales are much better than expected.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.800
So we need to purchase more flower fields

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.680
and more farmers.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.080
There are many people in Chang'an who don't have fixed income

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.200
but people with labor ability.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.600
So my suggestion is to hire them to farm.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.080
to earn more money

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.280
make more money to improve their lives.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.720
Secondly, I suggest

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.320
I suggest

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.160
to train more beauty knowledge.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.960
Men train beauty makeup.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.450
Will anyone listen to them?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.320
For some reason,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.320
I always treat you as my sister.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.920
Don't forget the opposite sex.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.680
It's more convincing

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.680
might be more convincing than women.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.160
Heroes are the best examples.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.160
And

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.440
we have to try something different.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.080
We not only want to make women's makeup,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.960
We also need to develop men's cosmetics.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.600
How can men make up?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.560
Isn't this a fantasy?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.520
Why do I always forget that you're a man?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.720
Baby say more

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.400
I almost died on the spot.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.860
Come to think of it,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.720
Zheng,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.840
I didn't expect you

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.920
about beauty.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.080
The hero and I thought

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.940
and won't think about it anymore.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.810
After all, the Chamber of Commerce won't threaten you anymore.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.160
Anyway,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.080
I really like making up.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.440
and that's what I think is right.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.200
There are so many mistakes in the world.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.080
It's not easy to meet the right one.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.400
Shouldn't you stick to what's worth it?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.220
By the way, Jin'er,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.160
Coach Xue gave you so much money.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.960
You're already a rich woman.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.980
Are you sure you want to start a business with me?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800
You want me to take care of my family?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.200
That's impossible.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.920
I know what kind of woman I am.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.040
I just like wandering in the crowd.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.800
I like to dress up every day.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.080
To put it bluntly,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.900
she just likes to show off.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.960
No matter how popular the Lucky Carp Alliance is,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.920
they will only call me Madam.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.320
I still want others to call me Gu Jin'er.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.960
Beauty makes me happy

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.280
I feel different.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.359
I was born for beauty.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.880
Why not?

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.240
Okay, it's a deal.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.880
Let's work hard to do our business.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.720
Let’s do it.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.490
Welcome the new chief of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.160
My lord.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.080
Lord Wu has given you ten days

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.600
in ten days.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.000
and connect the connections of the four Elders.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.840
This is

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.120
these days.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.360
these days.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.740
Please have a look.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.240
Zheng.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.440
The dish we just made

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.440
Look. The ingredients are all the same.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.480
There's a spoonful of sugar.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.160
That's totally different

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.720
Did you add sugar?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.480
Yes, I think it's so fresh.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:25.960
Right?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.970
I find that I have nothing to do.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.200
I cook a few dishes at home.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.880
It's really fulfilling.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.160
Let me tell you.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.200
I'll take you to buy groceries tomorrow.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.840
There are many things to learn and learn about grocery shopping.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.280
Really?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.840
Really?

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.120
I'll ask them to prepare two pizzas.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.680
They look more professional when shopping.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.440
Yes, it's convenient

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.640
It's big

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.820
and a lot of dishes.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.420
It's not easy to get bored.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.600
Okay, this is good.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.840
Sure.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.680
Why do you look so pale?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.040
How about I make you some gelatin?

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.200
Xu Ziqi.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.840
It's fine if you like cooking.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.200
Why did you drag Jang Gui-jae along?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.360
You don’t have much work to do.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.880
Zhang Gui Cai's men

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.810
has thousands of people to manage.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.220
It doesn't matter.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.200
Family affairs and state affairs

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.680
Jin'er comes first.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.240
Jin'er.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.040
How about I warm a bowl for you?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040
Red date soup?

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.960
I just made you osmanthus minced fish.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.960
It's delicious.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960
Don't you like it the most?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.160
Try it. I learned it from him.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.960
Have a taste.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.000
Is it good?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.680
Wait.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.200
Can you feel it?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.600
Why is there a chill in this weather?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.440
Cold?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.680
It's not cold wind.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.080
It's the lonely wind.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.160
Lonely.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.440
Do you feel it?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.280
In this cold wind,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.240
in the cold.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.440
The cold comes from that door.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240
Separate hatred.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.880
Li!

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.010
Separating hatred.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.850
Why are you here?

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.680
Xiao Zheng.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440
I remember when you first entered the mansion,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.440
when you first entered the mansion.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.680
I didn’t take it to heart.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.000
The four elders of the Chamber of Commerce

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.760
I was threatened by them.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.020
to force you to hand over the drawing.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.360
I was wrong.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.400
I came here today

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.480
to invite you

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.160
to join the Chamber of Commerce again.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.620
and do business together.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.700
Xiao Zheng.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.880
The next step

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.960
my next move to the picture.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.280
I know it's important.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920
You can take a look at this first.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.400
The store will give a detailed statement.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.930
If you think it's possible,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.880
we can discuss the rest.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.680
Separate hatred.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.160
I don't know

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.760
I don't know how to answer you.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.920
Indeed, we're going to keep doing makeup.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.040
We also have our plan.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.490
We don’t have to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.760
The Chamber of Commerce is no longer the previous Chamber of Commerce.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.040
Now the Chamber of Commerce

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.480
in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.920
The Chamber of Commerce has been doing business of rich people.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.240
Our small business

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.580
are doing business of the people.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.620
We have different customers.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.680
Why do we have to get involved?

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.200
I want to do something good

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.240
for the people.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.680
I need good things

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.560
to win the people's support.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.360
Release hatred

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.020
Xiao Zheng.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200
I know you’re worried.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.280
But please go back

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.000
and read the store in detail.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960
When you're done,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.360
if you still think we can't work together,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.100
I won't force you anymore.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960
What do you think?

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.000
Is the Chamber of Commerce reliable?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.360
How can this house turn against each other faster than turning the table?

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.680
Exactly.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.730
Let's not talk about the store.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.610
the people's hearts

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.120
How can you force it?

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.880
It's impossible to win people's support

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.200
for the people.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.840
People are not fools.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.880
It's okay.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.840
Although the Chamber of Commerce has changed,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.520
but the person behind it hasn't changed.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.200
I know.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.360
Xu Ziqi.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.170
What are you looking at?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.620
Before the three Elders died,

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760
left these strange symbols

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.280
in the prison.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.200
The guards wrote them down.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.240
Now I want to try my best

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.440
to find the whereabouts of the ledger.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.960
Let me see.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.010
I don't understand.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.600
It's just a ledger.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.400
Why is Her Majesty making a fuss?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.520
After so many years,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.000
and so many palace spies.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.160
It's just a note.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.200
Zheng.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.200
Do you know

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.360
in the ledger?

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.960
The merchants

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.200
not only has he entered the people's daily life,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.960
but also trade with foreign countries.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.960
The amount of money they have

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.960
are recorded clearly.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.240
This ledger

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.960
not only recorded

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.040
what they do every year.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.400
and who they had money dealings with.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.960
and who is in the light,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.120
and what is in the dark.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.120
It also recorded

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.400
how much money they earned every year

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.480
to the national treasury?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.690
The Chamber of Commerce

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.540
to the national treasury at least 10,000 taels of gold every year.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.320
Where did the tens of thousands of taels of gold go?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.460
Thousands of taels

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.200
How many armors and weapons

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.740
How many armors and weapons can we exchange?

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.120
How much relief grains can we give to the people?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.400
The more greedy the Chamber of Commerce is,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.120
the life of the people will be harder.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.880
What I just said

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.220
is just a conservative estimate.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.120
The real amount

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.760
is more than three times the amount.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.920
How dare the Chamber of Commerce do that?

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.960
The four elders

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.920
are just scapegoats.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.720
The mastermind

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.520
is the one who stole the big head.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.540
The person behind this

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.600
must know

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.530
the ledger with detailed records.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.000
So he can't wait to find the right time

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.330
to kill the four Elders.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.400
And the spy department has made statistics.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.720
The next step

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.960
is to invade

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.160
the daily necessities of the people.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.240
Once they know

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.880
the daily necessities

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.930
They're oppressing me.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.090
and raise the price,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.040
the lives of the people will be miserable.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.360
I remember.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.160
When we were in Peace,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.900
you told me rice was getting more expensive.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:12.680
Yes.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.440
If the people can't even afford rice,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.680
there will be a lot of resentment.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.240
The people will be resentful.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:20.960
Tang

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.520
will be over.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.680
So all these years,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.520
for so many years.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.600
Yes.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.960
But now,

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.680
the four elders are gone.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.720
It will be harder to investigate.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.360
Do you think Lord Wu knows about the ledger?

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.720
I don't think he knows.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.240
Do you know that?

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.000
Don't even think about it.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.440
I...

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.980
Just lock yourself up and don't go anywhere.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.040
Try it. I...

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.680
What?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.240
Try it.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.040
Nonsense.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.680
Try it.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.480
There's no room for discussion.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.660
Why is it getting heavier?

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.160
You feed me fat.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.730
Let's get down to business.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160
Do you remember

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.880
I expelled you

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.600
I kicked you out of Chang'an?

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.640
How dare you mention that?

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.400
I see.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.200
So...

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720
"I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you."

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.840
I was afraid

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.480
you would get involved in the Chamber of Commerce

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.520
and got involved in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.160
Although the plan failed,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.680
but luckily,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.960
has a bottom line.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.920
That's why

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.200
with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.900
But you have to know

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.960
At that time,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.840
I risked

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.760
to see you

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.530
to send you out of Chang'an.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.440
How could I

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.920
put you in danger?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.680
So,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.280
you fell in love with me at that time, right?

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.100
Why did you skip the topic?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.680
I'm just asking.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.720
I want to know

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.600
when you fell in love with me.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.210
Let's get down to business.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.200
At that time,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.900
the four elders were there. It's easy to say.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.880
Now the hatred is gone.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.600
We don't know

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.960
about the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.680
what you should say,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.520
and what you should do.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.280
It's hard to say.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.920
So you can't risk your life.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.760
You can’t get involved

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.960
in the mess of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.840
You must have liked me back then.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.120
I didn't like you back then.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.200
You...

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.410
I fell in love with you at that time.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.440
Now,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.680
I love you more now.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.360
I'm a man.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.680
You're my woman now.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.160
How can I watch the woman I love

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.240
to risk my life?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.240
I can’t let you go back to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.840
back to the dangerous place.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.760
I'm your little baby, right?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.920
Yes.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.640
Will you give up your life

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.720
for me, right?

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.000
It's my duty.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.280
You told me before

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440
you would sacrifice your life

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.880
for the people of Tang?

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.480
I'm just like them.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.440
You saved me today.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.360
the people may suffer

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.040
in deep water.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.720
But if I let you join the Chamber of Commerce,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.200
I might let them

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.520
as soon as possible.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.960
Xu Ziqi.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.280
Xiaoai is also love.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.360
Love is also love.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.080
You have to sacrifice your love for Xiaoai.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.880
I want to do something

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.120
like you.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.160
What's wrong?

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.840
Oh my god.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.040
I said such philosophy.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.680
At that moment,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.000
at that moment.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.640
Yes, you're wise.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.880
I have a heart

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.480
I want everyone to live a good life.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.880
Let me try.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.040
Don't worry. I'm much better than before.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.280
Besides, we can

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.810
we can discuss it directly.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.720
Nothing will happen.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.160
I feel

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.680
I'm useless.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.440
Yae!

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.240
and my ancestors are great heroes.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.440
And now,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.920
I can't even find

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.920
such a small ledger.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.280
You're also good at war.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.760
You are also

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.520
in the battlefield.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.160
Besides, the ledger is also brain work.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.480
So many people hid such a small thing.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.890
How can you compete with them with your brain?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.720
Why do I feel like you're calling me stupid?

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.040
I heard that

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.680
people are stupid when they are in love.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.920
It's not your fault.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.720
It's my fault. I'm too charming.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.720
Okay.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.680
This is where you try your best

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.880
to protect.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.480
I want to protect our home with you.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.640
Let's protect our home together.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.200
And

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.440
Let me protect you.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.720
Personal merchant.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.200
Alliance Manual.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.000
The people of Chang'an

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.400
and free labor.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.600
If the individual who wants to do business

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.520
and every free worker at home,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.880
regardless of gender

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.280
regardless of knowledge,

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.480
we can make money to support our family.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.940
It will attract many people to participate.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.200
This kind of business

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.720
a betrayal.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.480
Yes.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.400
It's a betrayal.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960
Our goal

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.520
is to let every laborer have autonomy

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.960
to get out of the control of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.600
Huacai Hall is open.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.060
Huacai Hall, check it out.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.480
Go to Noble Lady Street.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:43.960
Okay.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.400
Go to the east market.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.440
You go to the west market.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.000
Take a look.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.760
Thank you for your support.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.220
Huacai Hall is open today.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.120
You can take a look inside.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.480
This is Huacai Hall.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.360
We just opened today.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:56.760
Hello.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.680
I announce

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.520
I, Hua Xiao Zheng,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.680
Gu Jin'er.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.840
Heroes developed

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.040
by Heroes.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.360
officially open.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.040
Okay.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.480
Let's go. Let's go.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.440
Congratulations.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.880
Congratulations.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.920
Master Hwa Chae

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.440
for commoners

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.440
and new services.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.160
Each frame

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.440
to provide customized beauty service

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.640
for you and your friends.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.020
Our frame owners not only deliver goods,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.240
but also teach you how to make up.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.680
Huacai Hall, gorgeous.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.160
Brilliant!

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.280
Let's be the most beautiful boy in Tang together.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.040
Okay.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.640
Here you go.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:52.920
Here.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:54.440
Okay.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.680
Huacai Hall

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.920
will give each of you a frame.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.160
This frame is a sign

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.600
for yourself and your family.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.680
It's also a symbol of your self-improvement.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.199
From now on, we're all family members.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.199
Okay.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.840
Look, the number of stars on this frame

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.320
is decided by

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.600
by every customer.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.580
You will get one star for every 10 good comments.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.280
One star is iron frame.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.840
Two are silver frames.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880
Push it like this.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.120
Five are the best.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.520
We have a golden frame at home.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.239
Gold frame.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.880
Let's start the free training for makeup.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.239
Okay.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.360
Our frame training is free.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.960
There are two sections in total.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.440
First, the booklet in front of you

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.400
requires everyone to recite it.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.530
Every word is right.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.600
Step two, get familiar with every makeup technique.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.960
Let's start now.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.000
A glimpse of lipstick between Huacai Hall's lips.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.440
The black belt of Huacai Hall is here.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.280
A glimpse of lipstick on the lips of Huacai Hall

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.640
A glimpse of lip of Huacai Hall has arrived.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.440
The goods are here.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.780
Your goods.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:27.960
Thank you.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.400
Thank you.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.240
The most important thing about base makeup is to be gentle.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.520
Don't rub it casually.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.160
The best way

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.600
The best way is to dip it gently with pads

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.360
and shake it slightly.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.040
Shake the extra powder.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.240
It’s more evenly on the face.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.120
Please show us

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.560
The first chapter.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.440
The second step to press the pink.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.120
Please.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.080
The most important thing about base makeup is to be gentle.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.920
Don't rub it casually.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.960
It's so easy to make up.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.600
The better way

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.960
is to use pads

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.520
Dip it gently

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.720
Then shake slightly.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.520
Shake the extra powder

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.560
Then press it gently on the face.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.440
It's more evenly on the face.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.540
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.520
If you have any questions,

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.560
please check the list.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.220
Please say it out loud.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.440
Me.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.480
show you again.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.080
You can choose whether to speed up or slow down.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.440
If there's no problem,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.600
let's move on

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240
the next chapter.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.560
Chapter Two Shadow.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.280
Everyone has different taste.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.640
The lines on the other side are different.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.720
You're a man.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.760
how can you put on makeup?

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.960
That's a good question.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.720
Our country's morale has swallowed everything.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.650
is magnanimous.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.480
Men are like women.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.280
have the right to pursue beauty.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.140
Similarly,

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.960
women can learn riding and archery like men.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.000
Everyone is equal in men's clothes.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.880
Everyone is like a star

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.320
like the stars.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.720
This is the purpose of our Huacai Hall.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360
At last, everyone who makes money

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.280
who makes money by fair means

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.600
are all great people.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.120
Am I right?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.840
Yes.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.800
Okay. Let's go. Okay.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.640
Okay.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.320
I'm incompetent.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.440
I persuaded Hua Xiaotong many times.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.170
she still decided to establish her own business.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.640
Lord Fang, other merchants in Chang'an

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.120
have been obedient

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.120
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.440
Only Hua Xiaochi

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.330
doesn't even give me this face.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.560
He even made

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.760
Every family needs a frame.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.760
Everyone can make money.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.960
I won't cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce anymore.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.020
If the whole market goes on like this,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.360
there will be no rules.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.560
It's inappropriate.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.120
I understand.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.940
Don't stand there.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.800
Come and eat with me.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.600
One coin.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:45.880
Two cents.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.520
It's a virtual money. It's not worth it.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520
is no match for

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.480
It's a sense of achievement.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.360
The texture and texture

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.960
This weight...

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.170
Hua Xiaochi.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.040
Do you think I'm air?

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.160
You only know how to make money.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.720
Do you still care about me?

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.960
Zheng.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.400
Baby.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.440
Aren't we together every day?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.520
Not at all.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.400
Smell it. It smells good.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:31.880
Boss.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.040
Coming

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.760
Show me this

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.440
Sir, wrap this up for me.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.480
Okay take a look at this

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.000
Okay.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.080
Zheng

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.160
I think this is pretty.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.320
You have good taste.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.520
We want everyone

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.800
in the garment of Huacai Hall

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.320
in Huacai Hall

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.080
who can tolerate

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.880
Let's go! Let's go!

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:01.600
Wings.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.640
When did you come?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.720
Two hours ago.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.360
two hours ago.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.960
Did you? Yes.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.800
Yes.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.560
Baby.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.960
I found a place

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.400
I can see the moon.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.920
From the philosophy of life

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.360
from philosophy of life.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.400
From romance to daily necessities

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.400
But I don't know any of these.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.240
I'm developing a new product.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.480
How about

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.560
talk to Yang Debiao?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960
I'm really going.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.920
Okay, go.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.040
I'm really going.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.440
Take care.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.040
In general,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.040
you've been

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.920
you've been making money.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.740
You don't care about me at all.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.080
You are greedy for money.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.210
You're ungrateful.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.040
Yes.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.320
Anyway, what you did is wrong.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.000
Look at Jin'er.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.600
No matter how tired she is,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.760
When you get home,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.360
when you get home.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.760
You're going too far.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.840
You are not qualified to eat fruit.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.460
Jin'er, eat it.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.120
Baby.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.920
I'm sorry, baby.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.520
I didn't mean to ignore you.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.440
I'm sorry.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.320
I'm so wronged.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.920
It's okay.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.560
My lord, I'm full.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.900
Serve the food.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.240
Eat more. Don't waste it.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.660
These are good ingredients that can't be traded with gold and silver.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.440
Eat more.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.960
Don't waste it.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.440
You doll.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.480
be so obedient?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.600
Whatever I say,

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.720
whatever I say.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.520
I told you

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.360
I can have this honor

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.090
because of Lord Wu's kindness.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.770
If you have any request,

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.520
I will never disobey.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.200
You may leave.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.760
My Lord, you are back.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.240
My lord, what's wrong?

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.640
What's wrong?

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.120
Are you okay?

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.400
I promise you.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.360
I won't let you be alone anymore.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.400
Empty Lady?

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.800
Empty lady.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.600
I don't know why

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.760
I always say weird things

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.440
to Xu Ziqi.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.560
Change it.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.600
I won't let you be alone anymore.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.840
Empty room?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.560
Alone.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.800
The bed.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.400
That's what it means.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.640
Baby, you know me.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.840
I'm really wrong. I swear.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.960
I will never do this again.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.360
Really?

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.600
I should buy something to make it up to you.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.120
Tell me what you want.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.420
I'll buy it for you.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.040
I want to buy it.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.520
It's nothing.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.360
Just tell me what you want.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.560
I'll buy it for you.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.720
Li's Iron Store has a new meteor hammer.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.240
It's handmade.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.600
It's very sharp.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.720
I like it.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.240
Buy it.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.800
And my nine-section whip is worn out.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.120
It's time to change.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.850
Change them.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.920
And my hidden weapons

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.360
are always used by my brothers.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.130
I want to buy a few hundred more.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:40.640
OK.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.760
You're so nice.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.800
Brother Xu,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.120
I don't understand how you look.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.240
What's wrong?

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.440
I can embrace the people of Tang.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.920
I don't deserve a hug.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.960
A match.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.080
Let's ignore them.
