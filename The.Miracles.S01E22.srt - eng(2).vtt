00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.820
It's fine if you want to make a name for yourself,

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.939
but you can't stake the entire Third Bureau on it.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.219
It's not just that we're unsure.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.179
The workers out there

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.140
are unsure too.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.060
If I were just concerned about political achievements

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
or my career path,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:08.780
I wouldn't need to gamble like this.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.939
I know they're unsure.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.060
But do you remember

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.540
why they came here in the first place?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.459
They heard

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.299
our Third Bureau was pushing new technology,

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.620
aiming to set a national record.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.180
Now other construction teams

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.140
are laughing at them.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.780
Do you think they're just fine with that?

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.780
Aren't they frustrated?

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.180
I'm not afraid of working with the Third Bureau,

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:27.620
but failing every single attempt...

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.099
Who wouldn't have doubts?

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.379
Using slipform for high-rises

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:31.500
is a first for the whole country.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:32.980
Who gets it right on the first try?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.260
If we quit now,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.859
the first three attempts were for nothing.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.739
Remember when we went abroad

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.739
to study the German research?

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.540
Concrete from pouring to forming,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.459
done in one seamless process.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:52.140
That is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.579
truly modern construction.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:54.819
In our country,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.140
if Shenzhen doesn't try it,

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.019
if our Third Bureau doesn't try it,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.019
then who will?

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.180
On our first day in Shenzhen,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.300
those words written above us,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.860
do you remember them?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.020
If we back down now,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.620
are we worthy of those five words?

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.740
Do you really think I don't want to?

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.180
The problem is, will the leadership

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.939
still stand with us on this?

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.979
What's all the arguing about?

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.219
Director Liu! Director Liu!

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.659
Chief Fu! Chief Fu!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.900
We've failed three times,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.939
yet you all still have the energy

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.939
to waste time squabbling.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.900
Sit down.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:42.580
Sit, sit, sit.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.539
Keep eating.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.620
I just got back from a meeting at the city.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.460
This slipform project...

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.979
We keep going.

00:02:59.139 --> 00:02:59.780
Good!

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.580
Good! Good! Good!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.379
Good! Good! Good!

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:06.539
Director,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.180
I just have one question.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.740
If the slipform fails a fourth time,

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:11.939
what do we do?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.740
As the chief technical officer,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.699
it's more fitting for me to say this.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.139
During this period,

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.939
we've been running experiments

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:24.860
and collecting data.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.500
Through these three

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.300
very real failures,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.419
this time we've basically

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.979
identified the core problem.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.060
For this fourth attempt,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.699
this old man

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.020
pledges to the organization:

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.259
If we fail again,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.979
I'll accept any punishment.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.020
Good!

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.099
I'll make this military pledge too.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.099
If something goes wrong, we're punished together.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.099
Good!

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.860
It's no big deal!

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.139
If we bear it, we bear it together.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.020
Good!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.180
Keep going! If we only pick easy jobs,

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.740
what will we have to boast about when we're old?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.020
Look at you.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.740
We'll all boast with you then.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.099
Let's do it! Do it! Do it!

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.539
Comrades!

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.539
Today

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.180
is our fourth Pledge Rally.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.460
We persevere

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.180
because we have faith.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.620
We are not just building a tower.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.420
We are creating architectural history.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.899
What others dare not imagine,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:21.740
we dare.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:23.579
What others dare not do,

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.019
we also dare.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:26.620
Do it! Do it! Do it!

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.699
Do it! Do it! Do it!

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.660
Do it! Do it! Do it!

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:48.620
Slow down! Slow down!

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.819
Watch your step!

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:56.420
Okay!

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:58.100
Come on.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.899
Three... two...

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.339
It's still better to be a guy.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:06.459
We women can't strip even if we're dying of heat.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.579
Save your breath and save some energy.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:09.860
There's still so much to move.

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.620
Come on.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.500
One, two, three, lift!

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:17.779
What's wrong?

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.019
Nothing. Let's go.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.819
In all my years as a worker,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.699
I've never seen

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.139
a construction site this busy.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.259
Aren't we trying to achieve

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.500
China's top speed?

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:28.180
If we pull it off, we win.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.379
Here.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.420
Can you look at my shoulder?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.060
What's wrong?

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.459
Just take a look.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:38.379
It's raw.

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.740
Raw.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.579
That's so bad.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.779
Here, sit down. I'll put some ointment on it.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.620
I won't. It hurts.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
In this heat,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.100
if it gets infected, it'll be trouble.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:56.819
The pain's making me regret coming.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.100
Our old worksite

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.180
wasn't this busy.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.939
Why did we run off to Shenzhen

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.180
to suffer like this?

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:16.899
You still have that?

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.939
Here's an idea.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:23.420
Listen to me.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:24.699
Take this.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:26.860
Just play any tune.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.019
Distract yourself a bit.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.579
What kind of solution is this?

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:31.819
Just try it.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.379
Play that song we heard

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:34.379
outside the shop last time.

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:35.100
That one.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.019
Yeah, yeah, that one.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.180
Sister Su, I don't get it.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.620
We're steel fixers.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.540
What's the point of learning this thing?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.779
No matter how tough or tiring it gets,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.060
we still have to make our lives

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.060
meaningful.

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.259
But this is just a cardboard keyboard.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.620
Who can hear it?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.660
He can hear it.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.459
Does it sound good?

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:22.379
It sounds good.

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:29.139
You just asked me

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:30.500
why we

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.579
had to come all the way to Shenzhen.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.059
Isn't it to give it our all?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.379
I've also been gathering my strength,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.940
wanting to give it a shot,

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:39.419
to see if we can

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.580
run towards a better life.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:42.139
Even if we hadn't come,

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:44.700
I'd still hope

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.820
that our future children

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:47.620
won't have to use

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.899
hands caked in mud

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.940
to play the piano.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.259
Each generation should be better than the last.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.899
It's just that it hurts too much.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:57.460
Just complaining a bit.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.019
Alright then.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.899
I'll ask the site for two days off.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.019
You rest up properly.

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:02.779
No, that won't do.

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.460
I can't hold everyone back.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.019
This side's hurt, this side's fine.

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:08.899
I can just add a couple more towels for padding.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.460
Brothers, put your backs into it!

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:30.340
Pick up the pace!

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.700
Can't let those guys laugh at us.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:34.059
Brother Lu.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.419
Can you tell your wife

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:36.460
and the others to slow down?

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.460
My hands are practically on fire here.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.980
No way.

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:42.820
We finally got the slipform working.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.580
We have to make up for

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.539
all the time we lost before.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.580
We have to catch up.

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:48.220
We finished this floor

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220
in just seven days.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.100
Isn't that fast enough?

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:51.340
Brothers!

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.059
It's piecework pay, more work more pay.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.419
Every piece you handle is money.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.419
Keep at it!

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.179
I heard it's one floor in five days in Hong Kong, China,

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:00.980
four days in the US.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.460
Our seven days per floor

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.220
isn't bad either.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.860
Right?

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.860
Chief Engineer Fu said

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.220
this slipform fears slowness, not speed.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.100
The formwork will stick if it stops too long.

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:12.179
Let's give it our all,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.419
push for one floor in three days,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.700
and break a record!

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340
Don't let the team down!

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.059
One floor in three days!

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.179
Set a record!

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.179
Alright! Keep at it! Go!

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.059
Finally, almost at the topping-out.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:00.700
So sweet.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.340
You promised me, remember?

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:11.659
Promised you what?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.779
Sister Su! Sister Su!

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:51.179
What's wrong?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.460
You need to go check!

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.419
They say the wall on the seventh floor...

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:56.980
What about the wall?

00:11:57.259 --> 00:11:58.220
They say it's deformed.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.179
No,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.539
the rebar is deformed.

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:02.539
But we did the anchorage properly.

00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:03.659
I don't know either.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.899
Let's go check quickly!

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:05.659
Go, go, go!

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.259
This building is about to be topped out.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.460
We can't have this kind of problem.

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:13.100
I'll go get the Supervisor.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.740
You go up first.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.580
You're something else.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.940
The building is about to be topped out.

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:54.179
You haven't forgotten what you promised me, right?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.460
Marry me.

00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:03.940
Who taught you this?

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.580
Get up, quick.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.220
Wait a second.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.580
This is this year's wages

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.220
and subsidies.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.580
Apart from what was sent home,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.460
it's all here.

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:14.820
Once the topping-out bonus comes in,

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:15.820
we'll pool it together.

00:13:16.259 --> 00:13:17.740
We can definitely buy a real piano.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.980
And then,

00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:21.100
we'll come back to the revolving restaurant here

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.899
and have a proper meal.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.419
Right now,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.220
standing on the tallest building in all of China,

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:42.059
I swear

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.220
I will marry you, Su Mingshu.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.460
Be my wife.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.940
In the future, if there's harsh sun,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.899
I'll shield you from it.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.899
If there's wind and rain, I'll shelter you.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:53.500
I won't let you suffer any wrongs.

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:55.379
I know you're someone

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.179
who cries easily and laughs easily.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940
I'll make you laugh more

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:01.179
and cry less.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.460
For this lifetime,

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:10.299
I'm sticking with you.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.340
Brother Lu! Sister Su!

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.820
A harmonious union for a hundred years!

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:31.740
May you have a precious child soon!

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.899
May you grow old together!

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.379
Wishing you prosperity!

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.259
Many children, much happiness!

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.700
This is the under-construction

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.980
Shenzhen International Trade Centre Building.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.620
This morning,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.539
with the final cubic meter of concrete

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.700
poured and completed,

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:22.779
this 160-meter-tall

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:23.820
behemoth

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.419
now stands on the shore of the South China Sea.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:28.419
This 50-story

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:29.659
super high-rise building

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:32.059
was independently constructed by the China Construction Third Engineering Bureau

00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:33.139
and built independently.

00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:35.179
It employed, for the first time, the integrated synchronous slipform construction technology

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:37.299
for both the inner and outer tubes.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.419
Ultimately achieving the astonishing speed

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:40.419
of one floor in three days,

00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:41.340
it vividly illustrates the principle that

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.940
time is money,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.220
efficiency is life.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.940
It has been successfully topped out.
