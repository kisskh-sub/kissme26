00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:16.140
Down.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.180
Up.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.299
Lei Xingxing.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:26.299
How did you get it wrong again?

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.939
This is the simplest basic skill.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.540
Do you know that?

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.900
In my twelve years in this industry,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.659
you are the person

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:32.980
least suited to be a nanny I've ever seen.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.259
As long as you work as a nanny for a month,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.620
the investment funds will arrive immediately.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.580
Look at this photo of you.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.620
That's still better than your dad.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.740
Look, your dad's eyes are gone.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.060
What do you mean "gone"? Hurry up.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.900
What took you so long?

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.060
Didn't you want grape flavor?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.860
This is yours.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.219
You're so timid,

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.300
yet you insist on playing something so thrilling.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.620
It wasn't easy to snag this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.060
buy-one-get-one-free coupon.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.939
Can't let it go to waste.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:46.620
Why are you always group-buying coupons lately?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.500
My workplace...

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.539
isn't it supporting these high-tech enterprises?

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.500
I'm in charge of policy subsidies.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.780
What? Looking for inspiration?

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.580
Just looking for inspiration.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.580
Mom, you have a message.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.099
Oh my god.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.300
I'm pregnant.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.099
Hello.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.259
Hello.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.139
I am a nanny from Great Virtue Home Services.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.180
Here for the trial run.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.699
How did you find a male nanny?

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.419
I placed the order at the amusement park.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.819
I checked the wrong gender option.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.979
Why don't we give him a try?

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.900
Try my foot!

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.979
A man definitely won't work.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.300
Right, it won't work.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.580
And his outfit doesn't work either.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.099
Hello.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.860
Hello, hello.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.580
Just now,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.539
regarding your living environment,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:32.379
I conducted an assessment.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.139
Great Virtue Home Services.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:35.539
Yes.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.740
and generated a report.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.259
Come, sit. Take a look.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.979
Sit, sit down.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:42.379
The green dots represent...

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.860
Look at the screen.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:46.939
The green dots are...

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:47.979
representing untidy areas.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.620
Red dots represent unclean areas.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.659
Green dots and red dots

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.419
are distributed very densely.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.659
This indicates that your living habits

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.259
are very poor.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.620
Who is a Leo?

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.620
Her.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:58.620
You are...

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.259
Guess.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.180
Aries.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.259
You see,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.300
among the twelve zodiac signs,

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.379
the two sloppiest signs

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.099
living together...

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.539
this kind of living environment

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.819
is understandable.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.139
So when you look for a nanny,

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:09.860
you shouldn't look for that kind of

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.740
traditional nanny.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:11.699
I am the most suitable.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.379
I am an Integrated Nanny.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.100
Takeout is here! Time for a feast!

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.819
Hello everyone.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.860
Dad, what is this?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.740
What did you buy now?

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.259
A rug.

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:22.980
Don't move.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.699
Put it down.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.019
Dad, comb my hair first.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:30.939
Dad will comb it for you in a bit.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:31.660
You do your homework first.

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:32.540
The homework from last night

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.220
is all done.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.100
There are just a few math problems left.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:35.980
I don't really know how to do them.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.060
Well, well, well...

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.139
Dad will tutor you in a bit.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.980
What the heck is this?

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.180
I'll go back to my room first then.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.740
Okay, okay.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:50.019
Where should I set up my bed?

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:50.939
Hybrid type.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:51.899
You... calm down first.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.180
How should I address you?

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.180
My surname is Lei.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.980
Lei Xingxing.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.819
Lei Xingxing.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.899
My situation...

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.860
I'm pregnant again.

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:59.379
So, having... in the house...

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.779
suddenly having a...

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.860
strange man...

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.860
is quite inconvenient.

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.100
Hope you understand.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.899
Um...

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:05.860
I also have an older daughter.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.220
Yes.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.740
You know, one mountain can't hold two tigers.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.420
You're pregnant, why choose a male nanny?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.300
It's inconvenient.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.339
How about... for your trip here...

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:12.259
we reimburse your travel fare.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.060
We'll cover the round trip.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.620
I think...

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.139
your current perception...

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:16.819
is a bit one-sided.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.620
Besides doing regular housework,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.139
I can also give the children...

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.819
tutoring.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.139
I can also provide the fetus...

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.579
with Advanced Mathematical Prenatal Education.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.699
I can use these everyday items...

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.500
to arrange geometric shapes...

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.379
and numerical figures,

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.699
thereby turning your living scenes...

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.660
into numerical scenes.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.500
This will make your mathematical thinking...

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.180
more active.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.259
This is the highest level of Mathematical Prenatal Education.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.019
Many children...

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.620
only win at the starting line.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.100
I can let your child jump the gun.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.339
How long is the trial period?

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.819
Two days.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:48.860
I'll give you two days.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:50.699
Start.

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:07.500
Why did you agree...

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.540
to let him stay for a trial?

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:09.420
Do you really want to find...

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.180
a live-in male nanny?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.860
No.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.779
The customer service at the housekeeping center...

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:13.540
sent me a WeChat message.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.300
As long as we try this male nanny for two days,

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.980
his KPI...

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.579
will be met.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:17.740
Consider it doing him a favor.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.459
They'll upgrade me to Star Diamond member.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.180
Honey, Star Diamond?

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.939
Oh my god.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.779
That's just pure nonsense.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:24.300
It's not nonsense.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.860
Let's try it then. It's just two days anyway.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.300
Right?

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.740
Let's see what exactly is...

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:28.740
Mathematical Prenatal Education.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.379
Actually, besides doing housework,

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:31.540
I can also provide...

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.819
very rich emotional value.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.740
Wait, you... how did you get in?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.779
There are only two difficult things in the world.

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:37.699
One,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740
is to put your own thoughts...

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.819
into someone else's head.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.300
Two is to put someone else's money...

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.500
into your own pocket.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.300
Look at you.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.339
You've done both.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.699
Really?

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.740
Just now, you were...

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:47.740
arguing in the kitchen...

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.819
about who manages the money.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.939
You won the argument.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.740
How impressive.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:52.819
I think you...

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.579
don't lack the talent for arguing.

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.939
You just didn't perform well.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.620
If you argue again now,

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:58.740
I bet you can win.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.100
Okay, okay, that's enough.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.300
That emotional value of yours...

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.939
is already maxed out.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.740
Go get busy.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:03.379
Okay.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.579
I got the offer letter

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.860
Was the person who hired you blind?

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.100
I didn't program you with

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.180
a mockery mode

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.220
You programmed me with

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.220
Straight male mode

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.740
What I just said was the truth

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.300
I have a problem now

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:29.139
I can't cook

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.939
That's simple

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.139
I'll send you a few

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.300
recipes that don't require high knife skills

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.100
and are rough and simple to make

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.540
Okay

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:36.060
Send them to my phone

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.379
This is for the Science Museum

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.939
It's the sample I made

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.500
of the intelligent voice system

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.819
You carry it up for them

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.620
You deliver it to them

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.500
It's too heavy, I can't carry it

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.779
I'll go find a security guard

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:52.259
Hello

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.259
Xingxing

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:54.379
Mr. Jin

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.620
How is it going?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.540
Is the nanny job going smoothly?

00:07:58.259 --> 00:07:59.579
As long as your funding is in place

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.620
our company

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.980
will soon be able to build

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.740
the first robot that knows how to slack off

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.060
Slack off

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.180
Is slacking off a good thing?

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:11.100
Anyway, slacking off at least represents

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.019
a high degree of intelligence, right?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.300
Understood

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.300
With your Boss Wang

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.779
we've already signed a betting agreement

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.620
As long as you work as a nanny for a month

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:21.300
without being exposed by the employer

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.500
the investment funds will arrive immediately

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:24.740
Okay, thank you

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.060
This food is too plain

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.299
There's no meat at all

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:34.340
This was prepared based on

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.820
data prompts

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.299
The glasses you're wearing now

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.980
have health monitoring sensors

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:40.139
They monitor in real-time

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.500
heart rate during meals

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.259
blood pressure

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.179
and body fat data

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.620
If it detects any

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.860
food that endangers health

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:47.259
it will issue a timely warning

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:48.259
Can we eat this?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.179
Please enjoy your meal

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:53.779
High temperature warning

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:55.860
High temperature warning

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.379
It's too hot

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:58.059
It will damage your oral mucosa

00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:58.620
Let it cool down

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:00.139
High temperature warning

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.259
High temperature warning

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:07.179
Excess fat

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.299
Excess fat

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:13.340
The vegetable is fine

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:15.179
The dipping sauce is a bit high in calories

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:16.139
After you dip it

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:16.940
put it in the warm water

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.820
rinse it a bit, then eat it

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.700
Then why did you make this dipping sauce?

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.580
I was afraid it would be tasteless for you

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.820
Isn't that totally redundant?

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:24.460
Let's... let's not get angry

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:25.059
You're pregnant

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:26.500
It's just that this

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.220
can this broadcast play just once?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.700
It's too noisy

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.340
Yes

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.460
I'll adjust it for you after the meal

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:31.419
Also

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.139
the items in the house

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:35.179
I've reorganized and stored them

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.019
If you want to find anything

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:38.820
just ask Blackie

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.700
Blackie, Blackie

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.820
I'm here

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.220
Where is the wrench?

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:48.940
In the cabinet behind you

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.299
Third layer of the toolbox

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.539
Have you put the wrench back?

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.379
Almost.

00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:15.659
How long is "almost"?

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.379
Have you put the wrench back?

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.779
I put it back.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.059
Pause in response exceeded two seconds.

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:25.340
You are lying.

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:26.899
Lei Xingxing!

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.379
No...

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:32.059
This voice system...

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:33.220
why does it have a lie detector?

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.059
If you want to keep the house

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.179
tidy at all times,

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.779
items must be returned immediately after use.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.820
Simple reminders

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.940
do not serve a supervisory purpose.

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:44.899
Have you put the wrench back?

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:46.580
Turn it off!

00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:49.299
You are currently a bit emotional.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.259
Blackie,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.700
tell him a joke first.

00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:54.299
Believe it or not, I'll stab you.

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:55.820
I do not believe it.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:02.620
Can you hurry up?

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:04.899
Boss Lei, you wanted to see me?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.419
That smart voice system...

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:08.379
did you tweak it?

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:09.899
Why does it have a Mouthy Mode

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.019
and a lie detector mode?

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.220
I set the voice system

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.539
to Self-Discipline Mode.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.740
Human self-discipline is forced out.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:17.379
Okay, okay, okay.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.820
Can you just adjust that mode

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.539
again?

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:20.299
Sure.

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:22.299
I have a serious question for you.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.779
I'm going to the supermarket to buy groceries.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.259
How can I buy

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:26.059
vegetables with high cost-performance?

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:26.820
Is that it?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.019
Did I need to come personally for that?

00:11:29.179 --> 00:11:30.419
Just follow the grandpas and grandmas.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:33.779
Don't write so cursively.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.379
Okay.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.779
You wrote this well.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:40.299
Hello.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.659
Let me introduce you.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:44.899
This is our previous nanny.

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:45.980
She took leave originally,

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:47.299
but now she's back early.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.500
My dad was misdiagnosed by the county hospital.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.019
Made me go there for nothing.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.580
So, for the previous wages,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.940
do I pay you,

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.779
or the platform?

00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:00.899
She is a Primitive-type Nanny.

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.259
I am a 4th-generation Integrated Nanny.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.659
It's not very reasonable for you to choose this way.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.500
You can't even stir-fry vegetables.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.580
And you call yourself 4th generation?

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.580
You... each generation is worse than the last.

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:12.419
You're not even as good as my heel.

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:15.019
I'm sorry.

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:16.419
I have a contract with Qingqing.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.820
You are indeed very excellent.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.220
You won't have trouble finding another employer.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.059
Hurry up and pack your things.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:24.019
Let's go.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:24.940
Can't go anymore.

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:26.820
Oh my god.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.100
What happened?

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:29.379
Dad, what happened to you?

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:30.539
Broke my leg.

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:32.179
Gonna need two nannies.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.620
What kind of family needs two nannies?

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.460
Hold this.

00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:35.740
Who broke it?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.419
Stepped on my own heel.

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:38.139
Where did you hit it?

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:38.580
Oh my goodness.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.179
The ball came, I jumped up,

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:41.580
went for a header, bam, landed,

00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:42.940
and stepped on my own foot.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.299
Can we have Xiaoxi and Qingqing

00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:54.419
wear small baskets on their backs at home?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:55.779
They always shed hair.

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:56.539
If they wear a small basket,

00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:57.700
the hair can fall directly into it.

00:12:58.059 --> 00:12:59.580
Trailing behind my butt every day

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.179
picking up hair...

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:00.940
it's so annoying.

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.139
Being hygienic is good,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.179
but you can't be a germaphobe.

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:07.179
Who doesn't shed hair?

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:10.139
How about you cook and I clean?

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:11.259
No.

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:23.779
Boss Wang.

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.419
Let's pause the nanny work.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.700
Mr. Jin, this morning,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.899
passed away from a sudden heart attack.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:29.700
The betting agreement is cancelled.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.299
I'll arrange a new task for you.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.419
Xingxing,

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:43.059
why are you resigning?

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.100
The boss who promised to give us

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.980
investment for the robot project

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:48.860
has passed away.

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:52.379
My department,

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:54.460
for innovative enterprises like yours,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.820
has many subsidy policies.

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.740
I can help you apply for them.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.539
I work at the District Government.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:01.059
Right, and also,

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:01.539
could you

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.659
help us build a

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.059
subsidy policy

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:05.940
AI Calculator?

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:07.539
For innovative enterprises like yours,

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:09.179
just by entering the company name,

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:11.139
you can instantly apply online for

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:12.059
all government subsidies.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:12.940
Is that possible?

00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:15.940
We need one-click search,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.700
one-click application,

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:18.340
automatic review, and automatic payment.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.980
It's doable

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.779
Why do you want to help me?

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:24.419
Me?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.059
Aren't I a public servant?

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.899
Right?

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:29.299
And I want to make you a benchmark.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:30.139
Someone like you,

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.220
an entrepreneur with low EQ,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.820
if you can succeed with our help,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.659
then other entrepreneurs

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:34.860
have no reason not to succeed.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:35.940
Right.

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.539
That's good.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.779
This way, while I'm at your home,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.740
I can also test

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.860
the robot I developed.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.019
What?

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.500
A robot.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:45.580
I agree.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:47.779
Look.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.820
Okay, okay, done, it's a deal.

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:54.580
You handle storage and organization.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.940
I'll handle Circulation Design.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:58.460
What is Circulation Design?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.340
I'll teach you.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.179
How to organize with more style.

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.220
So you only know how to do

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.419
work that involves talking?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.580
How is that possible?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.220
Am I not working right now too?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.340
What kind of robot is this?

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.179
A fifteen-yuan glass pendant,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.779
it's been wiping it for an hour.

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:17.059
Isn't that just slacking off?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.820
You say it tricked Qingqing

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.539
into washing dishes there.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.620
While it does Circulation Design itself?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.779
Isn't that just being lazy?

00:15:22.779 --> 00:15:23.419
Exactly.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.299
I set it

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:24.940
to Mouthy Mode.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.539
Oh my god.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.019
Why are you here again?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.539
You almost scared my left leg lame.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.419
Tomorrow,

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:31.100
it's going to participate in a startup competition.

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:32.580
If it wins,

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:34.059
we can get that thing you mentioned,

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.059
the one million government tech support fund.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.340
Then why don't you go?

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:38.940
I still need to optimize the Subsidy Calculator.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.220
Besides, my eloquence is okay,

00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:41.139
but my EQ is not.

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:43.299
That's quite self-aware.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:44.059
Self-aware.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.379
Self-aware.

00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:46.620
S-Self-aware.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.700
Self-awareness.

00:15:47.779 --> 00:15:49.019
S-Self-aware.

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:50.700
Self-awareness.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.940
Yes, self-awareness.

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:52.940
A live-in nanny,

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.539
sixty percent of what they give the client

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:55.700
should be emotional value.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.460
What kind of

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:58.460
emotional value can you provide me?

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:00.700
If you lose an argument with your husband,

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:02.899
you can use his face towel to wipe your feet.

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:05.899
Your dopamine secretion will also be more vigorous.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.139
What are you laughing at?

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.539
Is it that funny?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.779
That's a good idea.

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:13.740
The person who created me once said,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.299
only when technology has warmth

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.379
can innovation become a blessing.

00:16:18.659 --> 00:16:19.940
In my chip, he

00:16:20.019 --> 00:16:21.220
carved a sentence:

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.700
"You are not a cold machine,"

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:25.259
"you also have body temperature."

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:27.539
"Because you are always transmitting warmth."

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:30.779
"You took the love others have for children,"

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.460
"the love for parents,"

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:34.820
"the love for life,"

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.940
"and stored it all in the algorithms,"

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.899
"stored it in the chip,"

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:40.580
"stored it in time."

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:42.700
"It became my body temperature,"

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:44.700
"and became your body temperature."

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.940
"His body temperature"

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.179
"became the warmth of everyday life."

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:00.700
Boss Wang,

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:01.779
the online footage

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:02.940
has been sent back to headquarters for you.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.420
I'm currently in a meeting abroad.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.579
The experiment this time was very successful.

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:08.940
No one realized you are a robot.

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:11.539
A new mission has been sent to you.

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:12.900
Please keep up the good work.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.539
Yes. What new mission?

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.539
Attend a parent-teacher meeting for me.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.700
Now,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.660
the only person who knew

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.700
that you look exactly like me

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.220
is no longer of this world.

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:23.059
If this time

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:24.140
you also complete the mission successfully,

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:25.660
I will update you

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.579
to a new system version.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.059
Okay.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:28.859
Received.
